         * Returns the multiplier used to calculate the lower bound for which
         * a users adaptive brightness is considered valid.
         *
         * For example if a user changes the brightness when the ambient light level
         * is 100 lux, the adjustment will be kept if the current ambient light level
         * is {@code >= 100 - (100 * shortTermModelLowerLuxMultiplier)}.
         *
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if shortTermModelUpperLuxMultiplier is negative.
