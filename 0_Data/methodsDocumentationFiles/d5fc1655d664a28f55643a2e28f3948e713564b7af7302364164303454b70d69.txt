         * <p>If enabled, the LayoutManager will be queried for items to inflate/bind in between
         * view system traversals on devices running API 21 or greater. Default value is true.</p>

         * <p>On platforms API level 21 and higher, the UI thread is idle between passing a frame
         * to RenderThread and the starting up its next frame at the next VSync pulse. By
         * prefetching out of window views in this time period, delays from inflation and view
         * binding are much less likely to cause jank and stuttering during scrolls and flings.</p>
         *
         * <p>While prefetch is enabled, it will have the side effect of expanding the effective
         * size of the View cache to hold prefetched views.</p>
