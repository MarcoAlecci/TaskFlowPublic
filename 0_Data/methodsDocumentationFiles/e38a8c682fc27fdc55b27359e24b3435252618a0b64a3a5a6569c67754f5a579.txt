     * Tries to create a view from a tag name using the supplied attribute set.
     *
     * This method gives the factory provided by {@link LayoutInflater#setFactory} and
     * {@link LayoutInflater#setFactory2} a chance to create a view. However, it does not apply all
     * of the general view creation logic, and thus may return {@code null} for some tags. This
     * method is used by {@link LayoutInflater#inflate} in creating {@code View} objects.
     *
     * @hide for use by precompiled layouts.
     *
     * @param parent the parent view, used to inflate layout params
     * @param name the name of the XML tag used to define the view
     * @param context the inflation context for the view, typically the
     *                {@code parent} or base layout inflater context
     * @param attrs the attribute set for the XML tag used to define the view
