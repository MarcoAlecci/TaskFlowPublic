     * A string representation of this duration using ISO-8601 seconds
     * based representation, such as {@code PT8H6M12.345S}.
     * <p>
     * The format of the returned string will be {@code PTnHnMnS}, where n is
     * the relevant hours, minutes or seconds part of the duration.
     * Any fractional seconds are placed after a decimal point i the seconds section.
     * If a section has a zero value, it is omitted.
     * The hours, minutes and seconds will all have the same sign.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     * <pre>
     *    "20.345 seconds"                 -- "PT20.345S
     *    "15 minutes" (15 * 60 seconds)   -- "PT15M"
     *    "10 hours" (10 * 3600 seconds)   -- "PT10H"
     *    "2 days" (2 * 86400 seconds)     -- "PT48H"
     * </pre>
     * Note that multiples of 24 hours are not output as days to avoid confusion
     * with {@code Period}.

     * @return an ISO-8601 representation of this duration, not null
