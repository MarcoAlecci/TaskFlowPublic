         * Start defining a {@link SubscriptionPlan} that starts at a specific
         * time, and automatically recurs after each specific period of time,
         * repeating indefinitely.
         * <p>
         * When the given period is set to exactly one month, the plan will
         * always recur on the day of the month defined by
         * {@link ZonedDateTime#getDayOfMonth()}. When a particular month ends
         * before this day, the plan will recur on the last possible instant of
         * that month.
         *
         * @param start The exact time at which the plan starts.
         * @param period The period after which the plan automatically recurs.
