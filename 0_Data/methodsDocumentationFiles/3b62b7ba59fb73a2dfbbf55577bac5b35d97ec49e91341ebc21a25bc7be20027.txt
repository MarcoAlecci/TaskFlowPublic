     * Set video frame capture rate. This can be used to set a different video frame capture
     * rate than the recorded video's playback rate. This method also sets the recording mode
     * to time lapse. In time lapse video recording, only video is recorded. Audio related
     * parameters are ignored when a time lapse recording session starts, if an application
     * sets them.

     * @param fps Rate at which frames should be captured in frames per second.
     * The fps can go as low as desired. However the fastest fps will be limited by the hardware.
     * For resolutions that can be captured by the video camera, the fastest fps can be computed using
     * {@link android.hardware.Camera.Parameters#getPreviewFpsRange(int[])}. For higher
     * resolutions the fastest fps may be more restrictive.
     * Note that the recorder cannot guarantee that frames will be captured at the
     * given rate due to camera/encoder limitations. However it tries to be as close as
     * possible.
