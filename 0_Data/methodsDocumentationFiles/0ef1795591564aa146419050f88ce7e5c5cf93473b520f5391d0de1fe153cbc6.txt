     * For jobs with {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#addTriggerContentUri} set, this
     * reports which URIs have triggered the job.  This will be null if either no URIs have
     * triggered it (it went off due to a deadline or other reason), or the number of changed
     * URIs is too large to report.  Whether or not the number of URIs is too large, you can
     * always use {@link #getTriggeredContentAuthorities()} to determine whether the job was
     * triggered due to any content changes and the authorities they are associated with.
