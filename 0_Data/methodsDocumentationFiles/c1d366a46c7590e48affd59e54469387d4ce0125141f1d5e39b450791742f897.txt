     * This is called when the user is requesting an assist, to provide references
     * to content related to the current activity.  Before being called, the
     * {@code outContent} Intent is filled with the base Intent of the activity (the Intent
     * returned by {@link #getIntent()}).  The Intent's extras are stripped of any types
     * that are not valid for {@link PersistableBundle} or non-framework Parcelables, and
     * the flags {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION} and
     * {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION} are cleared from the Intent.
     *
     * <p>Custom implementation may adjust the content intent to better reflect the top-level
     * context of the activity, and fill in its ClipData with additional content of
     * interest that the user is currently viewing.  For example, an image gallery application
     * that has launched in to an activity allowing the user to swipe through pictures should
     * modify the intent to reference the current image they are looking it; such an
     * application when showing a list of pictures should add a ClipData that has
     * references to all of the pictures currently visible on screen.</p>
     *
     * @param outContent The assist content to return.
