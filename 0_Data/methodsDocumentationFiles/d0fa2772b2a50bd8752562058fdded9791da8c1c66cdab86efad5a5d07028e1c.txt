     * The application's restore operation has completed.  This method is called after
     * all available data has been delivered to the application for restore (via either
     * the {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()} or
     * {@link #onRestoreFile(ParcelFileDescriptor, long, File, int, long, long) onRestoreFile()}
     * callbacks).  This provides the app with a stable end-of-restore opportunity to
     * perform any appropriate post-processing on the data that was just delivered.
