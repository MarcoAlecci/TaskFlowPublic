     * Gets the Pseudorange rate at the timestamp in m/s.
     * The reported value includes {@link #getPseudorangeRateUncertaintyInMetersPerSec()}.
     *
     * The correction of a given Pseudorange Rate value includes corrections from receiver and
     * satellite clock frequency errors.
     * {@link #isPseudorangeRateCorrected()} identifies the type of value reported.
     *
     * A positive 'uncorrected' value indicates that the SV is moving away from the receiver.
     * The sign of the 'uncorrected' Pseudorange Rate and its relation to the sign of
     * {@link #getDopplerShiftInHz()} is given by the equation:
     *      pseudorange rate = -k * doppler shift   (where k is a constant)
