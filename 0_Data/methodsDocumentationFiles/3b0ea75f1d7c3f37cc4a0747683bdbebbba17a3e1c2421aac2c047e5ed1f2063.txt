         * Gets the supported preview fps (frame-per-second) ranges. Each range
         * contains a minimum fps and maximum fps. If minimum fps equals to
         * maximum fps, the camera outputs frames in fixed frame rate. If not,
         * the camera outputs frames in auto frame rate. The actual frame rate
         * fluctuates between the minimum and the maximum. The values are
         * multiplied by 1000 and represented in integers. For example, if frame
         * rate is 26.623 frames per second, the value is 26623.
         *
         * @return a list of supported preview fps ranges. This method returns a
         *         list with at least one element. Every element is an int array
         *         of two values - minimum fps and maximum fps. The list is
         *         sorted from small to large (first by maximum fps and then
         *         minimum fps).
