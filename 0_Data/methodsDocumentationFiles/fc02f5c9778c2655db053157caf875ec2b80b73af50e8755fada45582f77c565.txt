     * Override this method if you foresee a clash in IDs based on this scheme:
     * <p>
     * Base implementation returns a long:
     * <li> bit 0: Whether this ID points to a child (unset) or group (set), so for this method
     *             this bit will be 1.
     * <li> bit 1-31: Lower 31 bits of the groupId
     * <li> bit 32-63: Lower 32 bits of the childId.
     * <p>
