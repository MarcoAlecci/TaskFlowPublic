     * Sets the content of this ImageView to the specified Uri.
     * Note that you use this method to load images from a local Uri only.

     * <p class="note">This does Bitmap reading and decoding on the UI
     * thread, which can cause a latency hiccup.  If that's a concern,
     * consider using {@link #setImageDrawable(Drawable)} or
     * {@link #setImageBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap)} and
     * {@link android.graphics.BitmapFactory} instead.</p>
     *
     * <p class="note">On devices running SDK < 24, this method will fail to
     * apply correct density scaling to images loaded from
     * {@link ContentResolver#SCHEME_CONTENT content} and
     * {@link ContentResolver#SCHEME_FILE file} schemes. Applications running
     * on devices with SDK >= 24 <strong>MUST</strong> specify the
     * {@code targetSdkVersion} in their manifest as 24 or above for density
     * scaling to be applied to images loaded from these schemes.</p>

     * @param uri the Uri of an image, or {@code null} to clear the content
