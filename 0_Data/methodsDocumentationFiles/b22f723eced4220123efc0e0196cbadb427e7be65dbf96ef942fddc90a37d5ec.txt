     * Helper function to request a network with a particular legacy type.
     *
     * This API is only for use in internal system code that requests networks with legacy type and
     * relies on CONNECTIVITY_ACTION broadcasts instead of NetworkCallbacks. New caller should use
     * {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback, Handler)} instead.
     *
     * @param request {@link NetworkRequest} describing this request.
     * @param timeoutMs The time in milliseconds to attempt looking for a suitable network
     *                  before {@link NetworkCallback#onUnavailable()} is called. The timeout must
     *                  be a positive value (i.e. >0).
     * @param legacyType to specify the network type(#TYPE_*).
     * @param handler {@link Handler} to specify the thread upon which the callback will be invoked.
     * @param networkCallback The {@link NetworkCallback} to be utilized for this request. Note
     *                        the callback must not be shared - it uniquely specifies this request.
