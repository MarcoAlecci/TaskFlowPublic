     * Determine if two RSSI curves are defined in the same way.
     *
     * <p>Note that two curves can be equivalent but defined differently, e.g. if one bucket in one
     * curve is split into two buckets in another. For the purpose of this method, these curves are
     * not considered equal to each other.
