     * Return a new Context object for the given application name.  This
     * Context is the same as what the named application gets when it is
     * launched, containing the same resources and class loader.  Each call to
     * this method returns a new instance of a Context object; Context objects
     * are not shared, however they share common state (Resources, ClassLoader,
     * etc) so the Context instance itself is fairly lightweight.
     *
     * <p>Throws {@link android.content.pm.PackageManager.NameNotFoundException} if there is no
     * application with the given package name.
     *
     * <p>Throws {@link java.lang.SecurityException} if the Context requested
     * can not be loaded into the caller's process for security reasons (see
     * {@link #CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE} for more information}.
     *
     * @param packageName Name of the application's package.
