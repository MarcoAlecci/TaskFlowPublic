         * Sets the environment bearing in degrees clockwise from true north, in the direction of
         * user motion. Environment bearing is provided when it is known with high probability
         * that velocity is aligned with an environment feature (such as edge of a building, or
         * road).
         *
         * Both the bearing and uncertainty must be set for the environment bearing to be valid.
