     * Schedule an alarm to be delivered precisely at the stated time.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method is like {@link #set(int, long, PendingIntent)}, but does not permit
     * the OS to adjust the delivery time.  The alarm will be delivered as nearly as
     * possible to the requested trigger time.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> only alarms for which there is a strong demand for exact-time
     * delivery (such as an alarm clock ringing at the requested time) should be
     * scheduled as exact.  Applications are strongly discouraged from using exact
     * alarms unnecessarily as they reduce the OS's ability to minimize battery use.
     *
     * @param type type of alarm.
     * @param triggerAtMillis time in milliseconds that the alarm should go
     *        off, using the appropriate clock (depending on the alarm type).
     * @param operation Action to perform when the alarm goes off;
     *        typically comes from {@link PendingIntent#getBroadcast
     *        IntentSender.getBroadcast()}.
