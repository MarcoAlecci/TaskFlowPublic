     * Sets the position of the animation to the specified fraction. This fraction should
     * be between 0 and the total fraction of the animation, including any repetition. That is,
     * a fraction of 0 will position the animation at the beginning, a value of 1 at the end,
     * and a value of 2 at the end of a reversing animator that repeats once. If
     * the animation has not yet been started, then it will not advance forward after it is
     * set to this fraction; it will simply set the fraction to this value and perform any
     * appropriate actions based on that fraction. If the animation is already running, then
     * setCurrentFraction() will set the current fraction to this value and continue
     * playing from that point. {@link Animator.AnimatorListener} events are not called
     * due to changing the fraction; those events are only processed while the animation
     * is running.
     *
     * @param fraction The fraction to which the animation is advanced or rewound. Values
     * outside the range of 0 to the maximum fraction for the animator will be clamped to
     * the correct range.
