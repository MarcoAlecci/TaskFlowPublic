     * Called when the user tapped or clicked a text view.
     * IMEs can't rely on this method being called because this was not part of the original IME
     * protocol, so applications with custom text editing written before this method appeared will
     * not call to inform the IME of this interaction.
     * @param focusChanged true if the user changed the focused view by this click.
     * @see InputMethodManager#viewClicked(View)
     * @deprecated The method may not be called for composite {@link View} that works as a giant
     *             "Canvas", which can host its own UI hierarchy and sub focus state.
     *             {@link android.webkit.WebView} is a good example. Application / IME developers
     *             should not rely on this method. If your goal is just being notified when an
     *             on-going input is interrupted, simply monitor {@link #onFinishInput()}.
