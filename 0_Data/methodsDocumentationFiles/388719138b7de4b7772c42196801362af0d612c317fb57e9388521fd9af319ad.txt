     * Hide or unhide packages. When a package is hidden it is unavailable for use, but the data and
     * actual package file remain. This function can be called by a device owner, profile owner, or
     * by a delegate given the {@link #DELEGATION_PACKAGE_ACCESS} scope via
     * {@link #setDelegatedScopes}.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance, returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)}, where the caller must be the profile owner
     * of an organization-owned managed profile and the package must be a system package. If called
     * on the parent instance, then the package is hidden or unhidden in the personal profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or
     *            {@code null} if the caller is a package access delegate.
     * @param packageName The name of the package to hide or unhide.
     * @param hidden {@code true} if the package should be hidden, {@code false} if it should be
     *            unhidden.
     * @return boolean Whether the hidden setting of the package was successfully updated.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device or profile owner or if called on
     *            the parent profile and the {@code admin} is not a profile owner of an
     *            organization-owned managed profile.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if called on the parent profile and the package provided
     *            is not a system package.
