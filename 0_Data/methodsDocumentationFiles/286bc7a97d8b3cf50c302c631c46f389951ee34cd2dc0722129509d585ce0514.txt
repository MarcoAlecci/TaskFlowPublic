     * of the file system. On Android, there is only one root: {@code /}.
     *
     * <p>A common use for absolute paths is when passing paths to a {@code Process} as
     * command-line arguments, to remove the requirement implied by relative paths, that the
     * child must have the same working directory as its parent.
     *
     * @return  The absolute pathname string denoting the same file or
     *          directory as this abstract pathname
     *
