     * Relative bulk <i>put</i> method&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(optional operation)</i>.
     *
     * <p> This method transfers chars from the given string into this
     * buffer.  If there are more chars to be copied from the string than
     * remain in this buffer, that is, if
     * <tt>end&nbsp;-&nbsp;start</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&gt;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>remaining()</tt>,
     * then no chars are transferred and a {@link
     * BufferOverflowException} is thrown.
     *
     * <p> Otherwise, this method copies
     * <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<tt>end</tt>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<tt>start</tt> chars
     * from the given string into this buffer, starting at the given
     * <tt>start</tt> index and at the current position of this buffer.  The
     * position of this buffer is then incremented by <i>n</i>.
     *
     * <p> In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
     * <tt>dst.put(src,&nbsp;start,&nbsp;end)</tt> has exactly the same effect
     * as the loop
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     *     for (int i = start; i < end; i++)
     *         dst.put(src.charAt(i));
     * }</pre>
     *
     * except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this
     * buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.
     *
     * @param  src

     *
     * @param  end
     *         The offset within the string of the last char to be read,
