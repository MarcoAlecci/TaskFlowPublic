     * in the process. If the activity indicated by upIntent already exists in the task's history,
     * this activity and all others before the indicated activity in the history stack will be
     * finished.
     *
     * <p>If the indicated activity does not appear in the history stack, this will finish
     * each activity in this task until the root activity of the task is reached, resulting in
     * an "in-app home" behavior. This can be useful in apps with a complex navigation hierarchy
     * when an activity may be reached by a path not passing through a canonical parent
     * activity.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method should be used when performing up navigation from within the same task
     * as the destination. If up navigation should cross tasks in some cases, see
     * {@link #shouldUpRecreateTask(Intent)}.</p>

     * @param upIntent An intent representing the target destination for up navigation
     *
     * @return true if up navigation successfully reached the activity indicated by upIntent and
     *         upIntent was delivered to it. false if an instance of the indicated activity could
     *         not be found and this activity was simply finished normally.
