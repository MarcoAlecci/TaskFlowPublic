     * Install a config chooser which will choose a config
     * as close to 16-bit RGB as possible, with or without an optional depth
     * buffer as close to 16-bits as possible.
     * <p>If this method is
     * called, it must be called before {@link #setRenderer(Renderer)}
     * is called.
     * <p>
     * If no setEGLConfigChooser method is called, then by default the
     * view will choose an RGB_888 surface with a depth buffer depth of
     * at least 16 bits.
