     * Set the number of location updates.
     *
     * <p>By default locations are continuously updated until the request is explicitly
     * removed, however you can optionally request a set number of updates.
     * For example, if your application only needs a single fresh location,
     * then call this method with a value of 1 before passing the request
     * to the location manager.
     *
     * @param numUpdates the number of location updates requested
     * @return the same object, so that setters can be chained
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if numUpdates is 0 or less
