         * Convenience function for setting {@link ContentResolver#SYNC_EXTRAS_IGNORE_BACKOFF}.
         *
         * Ignoring back-off will force the sync scheduling process to ignore any back-off that was
         * the result of a failed sync, as well as to invalidate any {@link SyncResult#delayUntil}
         * value that may have been set by the adapter. Successive failures will not honor this
         * flag. Not valid for periodic sync and will throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
         * in {@link #build()}.
         *
         * @param ignoreBackoff ignore back off settings. Default false.
