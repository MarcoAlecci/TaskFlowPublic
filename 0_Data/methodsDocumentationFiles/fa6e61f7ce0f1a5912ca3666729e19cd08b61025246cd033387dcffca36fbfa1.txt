     * Returns a read-only ByteBuffer for a dequeued output buffer
     * index. The position and limit of the returned buffer are set
     * to the valid output data.
     *
     * After calling this method, any ByteBuffer or Image object
     * previously returned for the same output index MUST no longer
     * be used.
     *
     * @param index The index of a client-owned output buffer previously
     *              returned from a call to {@link #dequeueOutputBuffer},
     *              or received via an onOutputBufferAvailable callback.
     *
     * @return the output buffer, or null if the index is not a dequeued
     * output buffer, or the codec is configured with an output surface.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if not in the Executing state.
     * @throws MediaCodec.CodecException upon codec error.
