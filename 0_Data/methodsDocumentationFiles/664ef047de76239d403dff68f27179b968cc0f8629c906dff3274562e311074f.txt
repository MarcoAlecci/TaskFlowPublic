     * Sets the target scrolling velocity relative to the host view's
     * dimensions.
     * <p>
     * If both relative and maximum velocities are specified, the maximum
     * velocity will be used to clamp the calculated relative velocity.
     *
     * @param horizontal The target horizontal velocity as a fraction of the
     *            host view width per second, or {@link #RELATIVE_UNSPECIFIED}
     *            to ignore.
     * @param vertical The target vertical velocity as a fraction of the host
     *            view height per second, or {@link #RELATIVE_UNSPECIFIED} to
     *            ignore.
     * @return The scroll helper, which may used to chain setter calls.
