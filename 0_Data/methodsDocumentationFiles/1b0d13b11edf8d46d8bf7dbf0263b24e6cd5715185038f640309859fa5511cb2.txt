     * MmTelFeature capability may be enabled by the framework, the status may be disabled due to
     * the feature being unavailable from the network.
     * @param c The current capability status of the MmTelFeature. If a capability is disabled, then
     * the status of that capability is disabled. This can happen if the network does not currently
     * support the capability that is enabled. A capability that is disabled by the framework (via
     * {@link #changeEnabledCapabilities}) should also show the status as disabled.
