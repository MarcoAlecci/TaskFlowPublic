     * Implement this method to handle trackball motion events.  The
     * <em>relative</em> movement of the trackball since the last event
     * can be retrieve with {@link MotionEvent#getX MotionEvent.getX()} and
     * {@link MotionEvent#getY MotionEvent.getY()}.  These are normalized so
     * that a movement of 1 corresponds to the user pressing one DPAD key (so
     * they will often be fractional values, representing the more fine-grained
     * movement information available from a trackball).
     *
     * @param event The motion event.
     * @return True if the event was handled, false otherwise.
