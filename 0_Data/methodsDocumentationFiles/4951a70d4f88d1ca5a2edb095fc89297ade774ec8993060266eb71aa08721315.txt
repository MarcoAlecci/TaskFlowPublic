     * <p>Device discovery is a heavyweight procedure. New connections to
     * remote Bluetooth devices should not be attempted while discovery is in
     * progress, and existing connections will experience limited bandwidth
     * and high latency. Use {@link #cancelDiscovery()} to cancel an ongoing
     * discovery.
     * <p>Applications can also register for {@link #ACTION_DISCOVERY_STARTED}
     * or {@link #ACTION_DISCOVERY_FINISHED} to be notified when discovery
     * starts or completes.
     * <p>If Bluetooth state is not {@link #STATE_ON}, this API
     * will return false. After turning on Bluetooth,
     * wait for {@link #ACTION_STATE_CHANGED} with {@link #STATE_ON}
     * to get the updated value.
