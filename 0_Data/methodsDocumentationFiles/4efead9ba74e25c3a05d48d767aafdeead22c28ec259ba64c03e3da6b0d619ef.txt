     * Define the synthetic task stack that will be generated during Up navigation from
     * a different task.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation of this method adds the parent chain of this activity
     * as specified in the manifest to the supplied {@link TaskStackBuilder}. Applications
     * may choose to override this method to construct the desired task stack in a different
     * way.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method will be invoked by the default implementation of {@link #onNavigateUp()}
     * if {@link #shouldUpRecreateTask(Intent)} returns true when supplied with the intent
     * returned by {@link #getParentActivityIntent()}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Applications that wish to supply extra Intent parameters to the parent stack defined
     * by the manifest should override {@link #onPrepareNavigateUpTaskStack(TaskStackBuilder)}.</p>
     *
     * @param builder An empty TaskStackBuilder - the application should add intents representing
     *                the desired task stack
