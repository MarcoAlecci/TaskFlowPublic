     * Create and return the view hierarchy used to show candidates.  This will
     * be called once, when the candidates are first displayed.  You can return
     * null to have no candidates view; the default implementation returns null.
     * 
     * <p>To control when the candidates view is displayed, use
     * {@link #setCandidatesViewShown(boolean)}.
     * To change the candidates view after the first one is created by this
     * function, use {@link #setCandidatesView(View)}.
