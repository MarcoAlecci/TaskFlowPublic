     * Query whether the vibrator supports all of the given effects.
     *
     * Not all hardware reports its effect capabilities, so the system may not necessarily know
     * whether an effect is supported or not.
     *
     * If the result is {@link #VIBRATION_EFFECT_SUPPORT_YES}, all effects in the query are
     * supported by the hardware.
     *
     * If the result is {@link #VIBRATION_EFFECT_SUPPORT_NO}, at least one of the effects in the
     * query is not supported.
     *
     * If the result is {@link #VIBRATION_EFFECT_SUPPORT_UNKNOWN}, the system doesn't know whether
     * all of the effects are supported. It may support any or all of the queried effects,
     * but there's no way to programmatically know whether a {@link #vibrate} call will successfully
     * cause a vibration. It's guaranteed, however, that none of the queried effects are
     * definitively unsupported by the hardware.
     *
     * @param effectIds Which effects to query for.
     * @return Whether all of the effects are supported.
