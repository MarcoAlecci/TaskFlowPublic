     * Implement this to handle requests for the MIME type of the data at the
     * given URI.  The returned MIME type should start with
     * <code>vnd.android.cursor.item</code> for a single record,
     * or <code>vnd.android.cursor.dir/</code> for multiple items.
     * This method can be called from multiple threads, as described in
     * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     *
     * <p>Note that there are no permissions needed for an application to
     * access this information; if your content provider requires read and/or
     * write permissions, or is not exported, all applications can still call
     * this method regardless of their access permissions.  This allows them
     * to retrieve the MIME type for a URI when dispatching intents.
     *
     * @param uri the URI to query.
     * @return a MIME type string, or {@code null} if there is no type.
