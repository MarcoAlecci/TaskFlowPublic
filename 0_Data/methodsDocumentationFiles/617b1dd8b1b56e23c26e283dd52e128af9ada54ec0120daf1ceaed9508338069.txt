     * Using the line in the Path in this interpolator that can be described as
     * <code>y = f(x)</code>, finds the y coordinate of the line given <code>t</code>
     * as the x coordinate. Values less than 0 will always return 0 and values greater
     * than 1 will always return 1.
     *
     * @param t Treated as the x coordinate along the line.
     * @return The y coordinate of the Path along the line where x = <code>t</code>.
     * @see Interpolator#getInterpolation(float)
