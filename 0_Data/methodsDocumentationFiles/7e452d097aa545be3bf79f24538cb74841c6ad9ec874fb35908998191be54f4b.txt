     * Called by device owner or profile owner of an organization-owned managed profile to install
     * a system update from the given file. The device will be
     * rebooted in order to finish installing the update. Note that if the device is rebooted, this
     * doesn't necessarily mean that the update has been applied successfully. The caller should
     * additionally check the system version with {@link android.os.Build#FINGERPRINT} or {@link
     * android.os.Build.VERSION}. If an error occurs during processing the OTA before the reboot,
     * the caller will be notified by {@link InstallSystemUpdateCallback}. If device does not have
     * sufficient battery level, the installation will fail with error {@link
     * InstallSystemUpdateCallback#UPDATE_ERROR_BATTERY_LOW}.
     *
     * @param admin The {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} that this request is associated with.

     * readable by the calling app.
     * @param executor The executor through which the callback should be invoked.
     * @param callback A callback object that will inform the caller when installing an update
     * fails.
