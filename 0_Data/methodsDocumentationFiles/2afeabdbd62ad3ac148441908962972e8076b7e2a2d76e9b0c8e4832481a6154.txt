     * Sets the default activity. The default activity is set by adding a
     * historical record with weight high enough that this activity will
     * become the highest ranked. Such a strategy guarantees that the default

     * setting a default is inflated with a constant amount to guarantee that
     * it will stay as default for awhile.
