         * When LayoutManager supports animations, RecyclerView tracks 3 positions for ViewHolders
         * to perform animations.
         * <p>
         * If a ViewHolder was laid out in the previous onLayout call, old position will keep its
         * adapter index in the previous layout.
         *
         * @return The previous adapter index of the Item represented by this ViewHolder or
         * {@link #NO_POSITION} if old position does not exists or cleared (pre-layout is
         * complete).
