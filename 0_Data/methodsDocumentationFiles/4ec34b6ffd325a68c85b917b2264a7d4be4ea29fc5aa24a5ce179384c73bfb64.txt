     * Closes the given object quietly, ignoring any checked exceptions. Does
     * nothing if the given object is {@code null}.

     * @deprecated This method may suppress potentially significant exceptions, particularly when
     *   closing writable resources. With a writable resource, a failure thrown from {@code close()}
     *   should be considered as significant as a failure thrown from a write method because it may
     *   indicate a failure to flush bytes to the underlying resource.
