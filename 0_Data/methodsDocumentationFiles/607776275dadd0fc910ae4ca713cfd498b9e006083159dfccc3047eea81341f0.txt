     * Creates a group container for {@link NotificationChannel} objects.
     *
     * This can be used to rename an existing group.
     * <p>
     *     Group information is only used for presentation, not for behavior. Groups are optional
     *     for channels, and you can have a mix of channels that belong to groups and channels
     *     that do not.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     For example, if your application supports multiple accounts, and those accounts will
     *     have similar channels, you can create a group for each account with account specific
     *     labels instead of appending account information to each channel's label.
     * </p>

     * @param group The group to create
