     * Releases resources associated with this MediaPlayer object.
     * It is considered good practice to call this method when you're
     * done using the MediaPlayer. In particular, whenever an Activity
     * of an application is paused (its onPause() method is called),
     * or stopped (its onStop() method is called), this method should be
     * invoked to release the MediaPlayer object, unless the application
     * has a special need to keep the object around. In addition to
     * unnecessary resources (such as memory and instances of codecs)
     * being held, failure to call this method immediately if a
     * MediaPlayer object is no longer needed may also lead to
     * continuous battery consumption for mobile devices, and playback
     * failure for other applications if no multiple instances of the
     * same codec are supported on a device. Even if multiple instances
     * of the same codec are supported, some performance degradation
     * may be expected when unnecessary multiple instances are used
     * at the same time.
