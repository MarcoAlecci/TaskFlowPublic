     * Returns the effective size of the <code>AudioTrack</code> buffer
     * that the application writes to.
     * <p> This will be less than or equal to the result of
     * {@link #getBufferCapacityInFrames()}.
     * It will be equal if {@link #setBufferSizeInFrames(int)} has never been called.
     * <p> If the track is subsequently routed to a different output sink, the buffer
     * size and capacity may enlarge to accommodate.
     * <p> If the <code>AudioTrack</code> encoding indicates compressed data,
     * e.g. {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_AC3}, then the frame count returned is
     * the size of the <code>AudioTrack</code> buffer in bytes.
     * <p> See also {@link AudioManager#getProperty(String)} for key
     * {@link AudioManager#PROPERTY_OUTPUT_FRAMES_PER_BUFFER}.
     * @return current size in frames of the <code>AudioTrack</code> buffer.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if track is not initialized.
