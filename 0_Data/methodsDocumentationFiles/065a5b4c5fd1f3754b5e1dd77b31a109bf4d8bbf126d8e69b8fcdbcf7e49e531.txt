     * Indicates whether this View is opaque. An opaque View guarantees that it will
     * draw all the pixels overlapping its bounds using a fully opaque color.
     *
     * Subclasses of View should override this method whenever possible to indicate
     * whether an instance is opaque. Opaque Views are treated in a special way by
     * the View hierarchy, possibly allowing it to perform optimizations during
     * invalidate/draw passes.
     *
     * @return True if this View is guaranteed to be fully opaque, false otherwise.
