     * Called when the system determines the usefulness of this network.
     *
     * The system attempts to validate Internet connectivity on networks that provide the
     * {@link NetworkCapabilities#NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET} capability.
     *
     * Currently there are two possible values:
     * {@code VALIDATION_STATUS_VALID} if Internet connectivity was validated,
     * {@code VALIDATION_STATUS_NOT_VALID} if Internet connectivity was not validated.
     *
     * This is guaranteed to be called again when the network status changes, but the system
     * may also call this multiple times even if the status does not change.
     *
     * @param status one of {@code VALIDATION_STATUS_VALID} or {@code VALIDATION_STATUS_NOT_VALID}.
     * @param redirectUri If Internet connectivity is being redirected (e.g., on a captive portal),
     *        this is the destination the probes are being redirected to, otherwise {@code null}.
