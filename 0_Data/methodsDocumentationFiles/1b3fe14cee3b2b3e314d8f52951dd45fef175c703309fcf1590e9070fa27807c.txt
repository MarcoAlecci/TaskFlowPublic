     * Sets the projection map for the query.  The projection map maps
     * from column names that the caller passes into query to database
     * column names. This is useful for renaming columns as well as
     * disambiguating column names when doing joins. For example you
     * could map "name" to "people.name".  If a projection map is set
     * it must contain all column names the user may request, even if
     * the key and value are the same.
