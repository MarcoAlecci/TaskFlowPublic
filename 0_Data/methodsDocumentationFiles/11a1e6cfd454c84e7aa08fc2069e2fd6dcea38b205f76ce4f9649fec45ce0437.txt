     * Gets the animated value, given the elapsed fraction of the animation (interpolated by the
     * animation's interpolator) and the evaluator used to calculate in-between values. This
     * function maps the input fraction to the appropriate keyframe interval and a fraction
     * between them and returns the interpolated value. Note that the input fraction may fall
     * outside the [0-1] bounds, if the animation's interpolator made that happen (e.g., a
     * spring interpolation that might send the fraction past 1.0). We handle this situation by
     * just using the two keyframes at the appropriate end when the value is outside those bounds.

     * @param fraction The elapsed fraction of the animation
     * @return The animated value.
