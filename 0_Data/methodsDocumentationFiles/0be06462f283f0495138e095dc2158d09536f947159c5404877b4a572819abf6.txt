     * Sets the delay for reporting battery state as charging after device is plugged in.
     * This allows machine-learning or heuristics to delay the reporting and the corresponding
     * broadcast, based on battery level, charging rate, and/or other parameters.
     *
     * @param delayMillis the delay in milliseconds, negative value to reset.
     *
