     * Mute or unmute an audio stream.
     * <p>
     * This method should only be used by applications that replace the
     * platform-wide management of audio settings or the main telephony
     * application.
     * <p>
     * This method has no effect if the device implements a fixed volume policy
     * as indicated by {@link #isVolumeFixed()}.
     * <p>
     * This method was deprecated in API level 22. Prior to API level 22 this
     * method had significantly different behavior and should be used carefully.
     * The following applies only to pre-22 platforms:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The mute command is protected against client process death: if a
     * process with an active mute request on a stream dies, this stream will be
     * unmuted automatically.</li>
     * <li>The mute requests for a given stream are cumulative: the AudioManager
     * can receive several mute requests from one or more clients and the stream
     * will be unmuted only when the same number of unmute requests are
     * received.</li>
     * <li>For a better user experience, applications MUST unmute a muted stream
     * in onPause() and mute is again in onResume() if appropriate.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param streamType The stream to be muted/unmuted.
     * @param state The required mute state: true for mute ON, false for mute
     *            OFF
     * @see #isVolumeFixed()
     * @deprecated Use {@link #adjustStreamVolume(int, int, int)} with
     *             {@link #ADJUST_MUTE} or {@link #ADJUST_UNMUTE} instead.
