     * <p>Enables or disables the duplication of the parent's state into this view. When
     * duplication is enabled, this view gets its drawable state from its parent rather
     * than from its own internal properties.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note: in the current implementation, setting this property to true after the
     * view was added to a ViewGroup might have no effect at all. This property should
     * always be used from XML or set to true before adding this view to a ViewGroup.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note: if this view's parent addStateFromChildren property is enabled and this
     * property is enabled, an exception will be thrown.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note: if the child view uses and updates additional states which are unknown to the
     * parent, these states should not be affected by this method.</p>
     *
     * @param enabled True to enable duplication of the parent's drawable state, false
     *                to disable it.
