     * <p>Once a reliable write transaction has been initiated, all calls
     * to {@link #writeCharacteristic} are sent to the remote device for
     * verification and queued up for atomic execution. The application will
     * receive an {@link BluetoothGattCallback#onCharacteristicWrite} callback
     * in response to every {@link #writeCharacteristic} call and is responsible
     * for verifying if the value has been transmitted accurately.
     *
     * <p>After all characteristics have been queued up and verified,
     * {@link #executeReliableWrite} will execute all writes. If a characteristic
     * was not written correctly, calling {@link #abortReliableWrite} will
     * cancel the current transaction without committing any values on the
     * remote device.
