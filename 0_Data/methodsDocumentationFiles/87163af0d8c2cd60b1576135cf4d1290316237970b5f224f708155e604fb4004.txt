     * Disable reception of cell broadcast (SMS-CB) messages with the given
     * message identifier range and RAN type. The RAN type specify this message
     * ID range belong to 3GPP (GSM) or 3GPP2(CDMA). Note that if two different
     * clients enable the same message identifier, they must both disable it for
     * the device to stop receiving those messages.
     * Note: This call is blocking, callers may want to avoid calling it from
     * the main thread of an application.

     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This method is intended for internal use by carrier
     * applications or the Telephony framework and will never trigger an SMS disambiguation
     * dialog. If this method is called on a device that has multiple active subscriptions, this
     * {@link SmsManager} instance has been created with {@link #getDefault()}, and no user-defined
     * default subscription is defined, the subscription ID associated with this message will be
     * INVALID, which will result in the operation being completed on the subscription associated
     * with logical slot 0. Use {@link #getSmsManagerForSubscriptionId(int)} to ensure the
     * operation is performed on the correct subscription.
