     * application must hide the custom View (the View which was previously passed to {@link
     * #onShowCustomView(View, CustomViewCallback) onShowCustomView()}). After this call, web
     * content will render in the original WebView again.
     *
     * <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> if overriding this method, the application must also override
     * {@link #onShowCustomView(View, CustomViewCallback) onShowCustomView()}.
