     * Ensures that a slice is in a pinned state.
     * <p>
     * Pinned state is not persisted across reboots, so apps are expected to re-pin any slices
     * they still care about after a reboot.
     * <p>
     * This may only be called by apps that are the default launcher for the device
     * or the default voice interaction service. Otherwise will throw {@link SecurityException}.
     *
     * @param uri The uri of the slice being pinned.
     * @param specs The list of supported {@link SliceSpec}s of the callback.
