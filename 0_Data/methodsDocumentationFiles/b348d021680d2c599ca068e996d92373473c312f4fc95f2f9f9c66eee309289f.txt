     *
     * <ol>
     * <li>No rectangle is redundant (contained within a bigger rectangle)</li>
     * <li>Rectangles of the same height and vertical position that intersect get merged</li>
     * </ol>

     * @param extractor a function that can extract a {@link RectF} from an element of the given
