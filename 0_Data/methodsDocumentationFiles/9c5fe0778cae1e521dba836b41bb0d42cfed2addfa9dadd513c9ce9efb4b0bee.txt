     * <p>Connects two color spaces to allow conversion from the source color
     * space to the destination color space. If the source and destination
     * color spaces do not have the same profile connection space (CIE XYZ
     * with the same white point), they are chromatically adapted to use the
     * CIE standard illuminant {@link #ILLUMINANT_D50 D50} as needed.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the source and destination are the same, an optimized connector
     * is returned to avoid unnecessary computations and loss of precision.</p>
     *
     * <p>Colors are mapped from the source color space to the destination color
     * space using the {@link RenderIntent#PERCEPTUAL perceptual} render intent.</p>
     *
     * @param source The color space to convert colors from
     * @param destination The color space to convert colors to
     * @return A non-null connector between the two specified color spaces
