     * Create a policy object and set it to: new system update will only be installed automatically
     * when the system clock is inside a daily maintenance window. If the start and end times are
     * the same, the window is considered to include the <i>whole 24 hours</i>. That is, updates can
     * install at any time. If start time is later than end time, the window is considered spanning
     * midnight (i.e. the end time denotes a time on the next day). The maintenance window will last
     * for 30 days for any given update, after which the window will no longer be effective and
     * the pending update will be made available for manual installation as if no system update
     * policy were set on the device. See {@link #TYPE_INSTALL_WINDOWED} for the details of this
     * policy's behavior.

     * @param startTime the start of the maintenance window, measured as the number of minutes from
     *            midnight in the device's local time. Must be in the range of [0, 1440).
     * @param endTime the end of the maintenance window, measured as the number of minutes from
     *            midnight in the device's local time. Must be in the range of [0, 1440).
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the {@code startTime} or {@code endTime} isn't in the
     *            accepted range.
     * @return The configured policy.
