     * Converts a coordinate to a String representation. The outputType
     * may be one of FORMAT_DEGREES, FORMAT_MINUTES, or FORMAT_SECONDS.
     * The coordinate must be a valid double between -180.0 and 180.0.
     * This conversion is performed in a method that is dependent on the
     * default locale, and so is not guaranteed to round-trip with
     * {@link #convert(String)}.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if coordinate is less than
     * -180.0, greater than 180.0, or is not a number.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if outputType is not one of
     * FORMAT_DEGREES, FORMAT_MINUTES, or FORMAT_SECONDS.
