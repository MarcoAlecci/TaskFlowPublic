     * Gets the time offset at which the measurement was taken in nanoseconds.
     * The reference receiver's time is specified by {@link GpsClock#getTimeInNs()} and should be
     * interpreted in the same way as indicated by {@link GpsClock#getType()}.
     *
     * The sign of this value is given by the following equation:
     *      measurement time = time_ns + time_offset_ns
     *
     * The value provides an individual time-stamp for the measurement, and allows sub-nanosecond
     * accuracy.
