     * Returns whether private DNS is currently in use on this network. When
     * private DNS is in use, applications must not send unencrypted DNS
     * queries as doing so could reveal private user information. Furthermore,
     * if private DNS is in use and {@link #getPrivateDnsServerName} is not
     * {@code null}, DNS queries must be sent to the specified DNS server.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if private DNS is in use, {@code false} otherwise.
