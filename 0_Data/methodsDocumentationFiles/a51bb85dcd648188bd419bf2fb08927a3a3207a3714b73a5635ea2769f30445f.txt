     * Create a new MotionEvent, filling in all of the basic values that
     * define the motion.
     *
     * @param downTime The time (in ms) when the user originally pressed down to start
     * a stream of position events.  This must be obtained from {@link SystemClock#uptimeMillis()}.
     * @param eventTime  The the time (in ms) when this specific event was generated.  This
     * must be obtained from {@link SystemClock#uptimeMillis()}.
     * @param action The kind of action being performed, such as {@link #ACTION_DOWN}.
     * @param x The X coordinate of this event.
     * @param y The Y coordinate of this event.
     * @param pressure The current pressure of this event.  The pressure generally
     * ranges from 0 (no pressure at all) to 1 (normal pressure), however
     * values higher than 1 may be generated depending on the calibration of
     * the input device.
     * @param size A scaled value of the approximate size of the area being pressed when
     * touched with the finger. The actual value in pixels corresponding to the finger
     * touch is normalized with a device specific range of values
     * and scaled to a value between 0 and 1.
     * @param metaState The state of any meta / modifier keys that were in effect when
     * the event was generated.
     * @param xPrecision The precision of the X coordinate being reported.
     * @param yPrecision The precision of the Y coordinate being reported.
     * @param deviceId The id for the device that this event came from.  An id of
     * zero indicates that the event didn't come from a physical device; other
     * numbers are arbitrary and you shouldn't depend on the values.
     * @param source The source of this event.
     * @param edgeFlags A bitfield indicating which edges, if any, were touched by this
     * MotionEvent.
     * @param displayId The display ID associated with this event.
     * @hide
