     * @param observer a RestoreObserver object whose restoreSetsAvailable() method will
     *   be called on the application's main thread in order to supply the results of
     *   the restore set lookup by the backup transport.  This parameter must not be
     *   null.
     * @param monitor a BackupManagerMonitor object will supply data about important events.
     * @return Zero on success, nonzero on error.  The observer's restoreSetsAvailable()
     *   method will only be called if this method returned zero.
