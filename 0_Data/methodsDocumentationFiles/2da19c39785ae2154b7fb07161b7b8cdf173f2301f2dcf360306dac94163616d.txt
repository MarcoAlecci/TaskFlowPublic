         * Provides the metrics for the shadow image. These include the dimensions of
         * the shadow image, and the point within that shadow that should
         * be centered under the touch location while dragging.
         * <p>
         * The default implementation sets the dimensions of the shadow to be the
         * same as the dimensions of the View itself and centers the shadow under
         * the touch point.

         * @param outShadowSize A {@link android.graphics.Point} containing the width and height
         * of the shadow image. Your application must set {@link android.graphics.Point#x} to the
         * desired width and must set {@link android.graphics.Point#y} to the desired height of the
         * image. Since Android P, the width and height must be positive values.
         *
         * @param outShadowTouchPoint A {@link android.graphics.Point} for the position within the
         * shadow image that should be underneath the touch point during the drag and drop
         * operation. Your application must set {@link android.graphics.Point#x} to the
         * X coordinate and {@link android.graphics.Point#y} to the Y coordinate of this position.
