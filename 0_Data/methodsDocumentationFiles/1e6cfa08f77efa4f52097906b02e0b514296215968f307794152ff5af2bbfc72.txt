     * Returns true iff. the contained NetworkRequest is one that:
     *
     *     - should be associated with at most one satisfying network
     *       at a time;
     *
     *     - should cause a network to be kept up, but not necessarily in
     *       the foreground, if it is the best network which can satisfy the
     *       NetworkRequest.
