     * <p>This is equivalent to connecting to this tag via {@link NfcA}
     * and calling {@link NfcA#transceive}. Note that all MIFARE Classic
     * tags are based on {@link NfcA} technology.
     *
     * <p>Use {@link #getMaxTransceiveLength} to retrieve the maximum number of bytes
     * that can be sent with {@link #transceive}.
     *
     * <p>This is an I/O operation and will block until complete. It must
     * not be called from the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
     * {@link IOException} if {@link #close} is called from another thread.
