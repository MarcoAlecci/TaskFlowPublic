     * <p class="note">
     * Note: no permissions are required when calling this API for your own UID.
     * However, requesting details for any other UID requires the
     * {@code android.Manifest.permission#PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS} permission, which
     * is a system-level permission that will not be granted to normal apps.
     * Declaring that permission expresses your intention to use this API and an
     * end user can then choose to grant this permission through the Settings
     * application.
