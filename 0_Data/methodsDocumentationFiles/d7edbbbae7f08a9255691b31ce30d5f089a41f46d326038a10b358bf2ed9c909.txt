     * Tell the bitmap if all of the pixels are known to be opaque (false)
     * or if some of the pixels may contain non-opaque alpha values (true).
     * Note, for some configs (e.g. RGB_565) this call is ignored, since it
     * does not support per-pixel alpha values.
     *
     * This is meant as a drawing hint, as in some cases a bitmap that is known
     * to be opaque can take a faster drawing case than one that may have
     * non-opaque per-pixel alpha values.
