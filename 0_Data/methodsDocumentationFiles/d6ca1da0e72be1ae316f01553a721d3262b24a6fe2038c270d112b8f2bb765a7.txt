     * Sets the absolute maximum scrolling velocity.
     * <p>
     * If relative velocity is not specified, scrolling will always reach the
     * same maximum velocity. If both relative and maximum velocities are
     * specified, the maximum velocity will be used to clamp the calculated
     * relative velocity.
     *
     * @param horizontalMax The maximum horizontal scrolling velocity, or
     *            {@link #NO_MAX} to leave the relative value unconstrained.
     * @param verticalMax The maximum vertical scrolling velocity, or
     *            {@link #NO_MAX} to leave the relative value unconstrained.
     * @return The scroll helper, which may used to chain setter calls.
