     * Prepare the Screen's standard options menu to be displayed.  This is
     * called right before the menu is shown, every time it is shown.  You can
     * use this method to efficiently enable/disable items or otherwise
     * dynamically modify the contents.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation updates the system menu items based on the
     * activity's state.  Deriving classes should always call through to the
     * base class implementation.
     *
     * @param menu The options menu as last shown or first initialized by
     *             onCreateOptionsMenu().

     *         if you return false it will not be shown.
