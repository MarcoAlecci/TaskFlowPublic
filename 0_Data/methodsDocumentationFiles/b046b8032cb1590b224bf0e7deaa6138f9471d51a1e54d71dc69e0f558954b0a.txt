     * the input focus.

     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> If this view hierarchy has a {@link SurfaceView} embedding another
     * view hierarchy via {@link SurfaceView#setChildSurfacePackage}, there is a limitation that
     * this API won't be able to find the node for the view in the specified direction on the
     * embedded view hierarchy. It's because views don't know about the embedded hierarchies.
     * Instead, you could traverse all the children to find the node.
