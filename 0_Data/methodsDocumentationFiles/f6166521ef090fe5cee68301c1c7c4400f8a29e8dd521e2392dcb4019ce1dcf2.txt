         * Method called when all item animations should be ended immediately.
         * This could happen when other events, like scrolling, occur, so that
         * animating views can be quickly put into their proper end locations.
         * Implementations should ensure that any animations running on any items
         * are canceled and affected properties are set to their end values.
         * Also, {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished(ViewHolder)} should be called for each finished
         * animation since the animations are effectively done when this method is called.
