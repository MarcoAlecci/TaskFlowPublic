     * A hack to allow tunneling of LTE information via GsmCellLocation
     * so that older Network Location Providers can return some information
     * on LTE only networks, see bug 9228974.
     *
     * The tunnel'd LTE information is returned as follows:
     *   LAC = TAC field
     *   CID = CI field
     *   PSC = 0.
