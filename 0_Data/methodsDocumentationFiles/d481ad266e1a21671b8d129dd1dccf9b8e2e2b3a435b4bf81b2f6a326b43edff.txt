     * Called when an activity you launched with an activity transition exposes this
     * Activity through a returning activity transition, giving you the resultCode
     * and any additional data from it. This method will only be called if the activity
     * set a result code other than {@link #RESULT_CANCELED} and it supports activity
     * transitions with {@link Window#FEATURE_ACTIVITY_TRANSITIONS}.
     *
     * <p>The purpose of this function is to let the called Activity send a hint about
     * its state so that this underlying Activity can prepare to be exposed. A call to
     * this method does not guarantee that the called Activity has or will be exiting soon.
     * It only indicates that it will expose this Activity's Window and it has
     * some data to pass to prepare it.</p>
     *
     * @param resultCode The integer result code returned by the child activity
     *                   through its setResult().
     * @param data An Intent, which can return result data to the caller
     *               (various data can be attached to Intent "extras").
