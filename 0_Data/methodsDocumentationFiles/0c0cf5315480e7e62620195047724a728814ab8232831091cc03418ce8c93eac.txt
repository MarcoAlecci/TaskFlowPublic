         * Called when an insets animation gets started.
         * <p>
         * Note that, like {@link #onProgress}, dispatch of the animation start event is
         * hierarchical: It will starts at the root of the view hierarchy and then traverse it
         * and invoke the callback of the specific {@link View} that is being traversed.
         * The method may return a modified
         * instance of the bounds by calling {@link Bounds#inset} to indicate that a part of
         * the insets have been used to offset or clip its children, and the children shouldn't
         * worry about that part anymore. Furthermore, if {@link #getDispatchMode()} returns
         * {@link #DISPATCH_MODE_STOP}, children of this view will not receive the callback anymore.
         *
         * @param animation The animation that is about to start.
         * @param bounds The bounds in which animation happens.
         * @return The animation representing the part of the insets that should be dispatched to
         *         the subtree of the hierarchy.
