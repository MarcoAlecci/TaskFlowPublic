     * transition to destination state. Upon returning
     * from processMessage the current state's exit will
     * be executed and upon the next message arriving
     * destState.enter will be invoked.
     *
     * this function can also be called inside the enter function of the
     * previous transition target, but the behavior is undefined when it is
     * called mid-way through a previous transition (for example, calling this
     * in the enter() routine of a intermediate node when the current transition
     * target is one of the nodes descendants).
     *
     * @param destState will be the state that receives the next message.
