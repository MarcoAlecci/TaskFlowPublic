     * Retrieves a list of activities that specify {@link Intent#ACTION_MAIN} and
     * {@link Intent#CATEGORY_LAUNCHER}, across all apps, for a specified user. If an app doesn't
     * have any activities that specify <code>ACTION_MAIN</code> or <code>CATEGORY_LAUNCHER</code>,
     * the system adds a synthesized activity to the list. This synthesized activity represents the
     * app's details page within system settings.
     *
     * <p class="note"><b>Note: </b>It's possible for system apps, such as app stores, to prevent
     * the system from adding synthesized activities to the returned list.</p>
     *
     * <p>As of <a href="/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html#Q">Android Q</a>, at least
     * one of the app's activities or synthesized activities appears in the returned list unless the
     * app satisfies at least one of the following conditions:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>The app is a system app.</li>
     * <li>The app doesn't request any <a href="/guide/topics/permissions/overview">permissions</a>.
     * </li>
     * <li>The app doesn't have a <em>launcher activity</em> that is enabled by default. A launcher
     * activity has an intent containing the <code>ACTION_MAIN</code> action and the
     * <code>CATEGORY_LAUNCHER</code> category.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Additionally, the system hides synthesized activities for some or all apps in the
     * following enterprise-related cases:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the device is a
     * <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/work/overview#company-owned-devices-for-knowledge-workers">fully
     * managed device</a>, no synthesized activities for any app appear in the returned list.</li>
     * <li>If the current user has a
     * <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/work/overview#employee-owned-devices-byod">work
     * profile</a>, no synthesized activities for the user's work apps appear in the returned
     * list.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param packageName The specific package to query. If null, it checks all installed packages
     *            in the profile.
     * @param user The UserHandle of the profile.
     * @return List of launchable activities. Can be an empty list but will not be null.
