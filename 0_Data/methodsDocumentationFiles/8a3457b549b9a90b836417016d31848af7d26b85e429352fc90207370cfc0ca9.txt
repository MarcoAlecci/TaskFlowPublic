         * <p>Notifies the end of the animation. This callback is not invoked
         * for animations with repeat count set to INFINITE.</p>
         *
         * <p>This method's default behavior is to call {@link #onAnimationEnd(Animator)}. This
         * method can be overridden, though not required, to get the additional play direction info
         * when an animation ends. Skipping calling super when overriding this method results in
         * {@link #onAnimationEnd(Animator)} not getting called.
         *
         * @param animation The animation which reached its end.
         * @param isReverse Whether the animation is playing in reverse.
