         * Method to be called by subclasses when an animation is started.
         * <p>
         * For each call RecyclerView makes to
         * {@link #animateAppearance(ViewHolder, ItemHolderInfo, ItemHolderInfo)
         * animateAppearance()},
         * {@link #animatePersistence(ViewHolder, ItemHolderInfo, ItemHolderInfo)
         * animatePersistence()}, or
         * {@link #animateDisappearance(ViewHolder, ItemHolderInfo, ItemHolderInfo)
         * animateDisappearance()}, there should be a matching
         * {@link #dispatchAnimationStarted(ViewHolder)} call by the subclass.
         * <p>
         * For {@link #animateChange(ViewHolder, ViewHolder, ItemHolderInfo, ItemHolderInfo)
         * animateChange()}, subclass should call this method for both the <code>oldHolder</code>
         * and <code>newHolder</code> (if they are not the same instance).
         * <p>
         * If your ItemAnimator decides not to animate a ViewHolder, it should call
         * {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished(ViewHolder)} <b>without</b> calling
         * {@link #dispatchAnimationStarted(ViewHolder)}.
         *
         * @param viewHolder The ViewHolder whose animation is starting.
         * @see #onAnimationStarted(ViewHolder)
