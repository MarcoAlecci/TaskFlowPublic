     * string creation for trace sections that require formatting. It is not necessary
     * to guard all Trace method calls as they internally already check this. However it is
     * recommended to use this to prevent creating any temporary objects that would then be
     * passed to those methods to reduce runtime cost when tracing isn't enabled.
