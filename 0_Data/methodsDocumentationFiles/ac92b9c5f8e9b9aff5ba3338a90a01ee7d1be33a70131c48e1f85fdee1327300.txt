     * Start Bluetooth LE scan with default parameters and no filters. The scan results will be
     * delivered through {@code callback}. For unfiltered scans, scanning is stopped on screen
     * off to save power. Scanning is resumed when screen is turned on again. To avoid this, use
     * {@link #startScan(List, ScanSettings, ScanCallback)} with desired {@link ScanFilter}.
     * <p>
     * An app must hold
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION} or
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} permission
     * in order to get results.
     *
     * @param callback Callback used to deliver scan results.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If {@code callback} is null.
