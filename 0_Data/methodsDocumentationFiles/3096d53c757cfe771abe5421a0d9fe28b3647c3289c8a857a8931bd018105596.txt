         * This method is called when the camera device has finished configuring itself, and the
         * session can start processing capture requests.
         *
         * <p>If there are capture requests already queued with the session, they will start
         * processing once this callback is invoked, and the session will call {@link #onActive}
         * right after this callback is invoked.</p>
         *
         * <p>If no capture requests have been submitted, then the session will invoke
         * {@link #onReady} right after this callback.</p>
         *
         * <p>If the camera device configuration fails, then {@link #onConfigureFailed} will
         * be invoked instead of this callback.</p>

         * @param session the session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
