     * Register an application configuration that acts as a Health SINK.
     * This is the configuration that will be used to communicate with health devices
     * which will act as the {@link #SOURCE_ROLE}. This is an asynchronous call and so
     * the callback is used to notify success or failure if the function returns true.
     *
     * <p>Requires {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH} permission.
     *
     * @param name The friendly name associated with the application or configuration.
     * @param dataType The dataType of the Source role of Health Profile to which the sink wants to
     * connect to.
     * @param callback A callback to indicate success or failure of the registration and all
     * operations done on this application configuration.
     * @return If true, callback will be called.
     *
     * @deprecated Health Device Profile (HDP) and MCAP protocol are no longer used. New
     * apps should use Bluetooth Low Energy based solutions such as {@link BluetoothGatt},
     * {@link BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingL2capChannel()(int)}, or
     * {@link BluetoothDevice#createL2capChannel(int)}
