     *             {@link NetworkCapabilities#NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_METERED} and
     *             {@link NetworkCapabilities#getLinkDownstreamBandwidthKbps} are calls that
     *             apps concerned with meteredness or bandwidth should be looking at, as they
     *             offer this information with much better accuracy.
