     * Registers a list of AIDs for a specific category for the
     * specified service.
     *
     * <p>If a list of AIDs for that category was previously
     * registered for this service (either statically
     * through the manifest, or dynamically by using this API),
     * that list of AIDs will be replaced with this one.
     *
     * <p>Note that you can only register AIDs for a service that
     * is running under the same UID as the caller of this API. Typically
     * this means you need to call this from the same
     * package as the service itself, though UIDs can also
     * be shared between packages using shared UIDs.
     *
     * @param service The component name of the service
     * @param category The category of AIDs to be registered
     * @param aids A list containing the AIDs to be registered
     * @return whether the registration was successful.
