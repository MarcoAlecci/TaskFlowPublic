     * Gets a URL that can be used for resolving whether a captive portal is present.
     * 1. This URL should respond with a 204 response to a GET request to indicate no captive
     *    portal is present.
     * 2. This URL must be HTTP as redirect responses are used to find captive portal
     *    sign-in pages. Captive portals cannot respond to HTTPS requests with redirects.
     *
     * The system network validation may be using different strategies to detect captive portals,
     * so this method does not necessarily return a URL used by the system. It only returns a URL
     * that may be relevant for other components trying to detect captive portals.
