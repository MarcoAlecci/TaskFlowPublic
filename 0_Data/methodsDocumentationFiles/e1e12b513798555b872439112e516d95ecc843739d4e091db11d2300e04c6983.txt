     * <p>Returns a representation of the specified half-precision float value
     * according to the bit layout described in {@link Half}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Similar to {@link #halfToIntBits(short)}, this method collapses all
     * possible Not-a-Number values to a single canonical Not-a-Number value
     * defined by {@link #NaN}.</p>
     *
     * @param h A half-precision float value
     * @return The bits that represent the half-precision float value
