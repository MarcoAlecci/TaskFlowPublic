     * Writes a trace message to indicate that a given section of code has ended. This call must
     * be preceeded by a corresponding call to {@link #beginSection(String)}. Calling this method
     * will mark the end of the most recently begun section of code, so care must be taken to
     * ensure that beginSection / endSection pairs are properly nested and called from the same
     * thread.
