     * Returns the volume in dB (decibel) for the given stream type at the given volume index, on
     * the given type of audio output device.
     * @param streamType stream type for which the volume is queried.
     * @param index the volume index for which the volume is queried. The index value must be
     *     between the minimum and maximum index values for the given stream type (see
     *     {@link #getStreamMinVolume(int)} and {@link #getStreamMaxVolume(int)}).
     * @param deviceType the type of audio output device for which volume is queried.
     * @return a volume expressed in dB.
     *     A negative value indicates the audio signal is attenuated. A typical maximum value
     *     at the maximum volume index is 0 dB (no attenuation nor amplification). Muting is
     *     reflected by a value of {@link Float#NEGATIVE_INFINITY}.
