     * Called when only the candidates view has been shown for showing
     * processing as the user enters text through a hard keyboard.
     * This will always be called after {@link #onStartInput},
     * allowing you to do your general setup there and just view-specific
     * setup here.  You are guaranteed that {@link #onCreateCandidatesView()}
     * will have been called some time before this function is called.
     * 
     * <p>Note that this will <em>not</em> be called when the input method
     * is running in full editing mode, and thus receiving
     * {@link #onStartInputView} to initiate that operation.  This is only
     * for the case when candidates are being shown while the input method
     * editor is hidden but wants to show its candidates UI as text is
     * entered through some other mechanism.
     * 
     * @param info Description of the type of text being edited.
     * @param restarting Set to true if we are restarting input on the
     * same text field as before.
