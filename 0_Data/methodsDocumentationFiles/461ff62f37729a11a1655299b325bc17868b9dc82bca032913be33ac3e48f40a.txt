     * Editors may use this method to provide initial input text to IMEs. As the surrounding text
     * could be used to provide various input assistance, we recommend editors to provide the
     * complete initial input text in its {@link View#onCreateInputConnection(EditorInfo)} callback.
     * When trimming the input text is needed, call this method instead of
     * {@code setInitialSurroundingText(CharSequence)} and provide the trimmed position info. Always
     * try to include the selected text within {@code subText} to give the system best flexibility
     * to choose where and how to trim {@code subText} when necessary.
     *
     * @param subText The input text. When it was trimmed, {@code subTextStart} must be provided
     *                correctly.
     * @param subTextStart  The position that the input text got trimmed. For example, when the
     *                      editor wants to trim out the first 10 chars, subTextStart should be 10.
