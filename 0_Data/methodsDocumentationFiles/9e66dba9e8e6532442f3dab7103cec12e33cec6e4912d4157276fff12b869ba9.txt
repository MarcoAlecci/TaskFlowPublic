     * Registers a new NFC unlock handler with the NFC service.
     *
     * <p />NFC unlock handlers are intended to unlock the keyguard in the presence of a trusted
     * NFC device. The handler should return true if it successfully authenticates the user and
     * unlocks the keyguard.
     *
     * <p /> The parameter {@code tagTechnologies} determines which Tag technologies will be polled for
     * at the lockscreen. Polling for less tag technologies reduces latency, and so it is
     * strongly recommended to only provide the Tag technologies that the handler is expected to
     * receive. There must be at least one tag technology provided, otherwise the unlock handler
     * is ignored.
