     * Allows a foreground application to specify which card emulation service
     * should be preferred while a specific Activity is in the foreground.
     *
     * <p>The specified Activity must currently be in resumed state. A good
     * paradigm is to call this method in your {@link Activity#onResume}, and to call
     * {@link #unsetPreferredService(Activity)} in your {@link Activity#onPause}.
     *
     * <p>This method call will fail in two specific scenarios:
     * <ul>
     * <li> If the service registers one or more AIDs in the {@link #CATEGORY_PAYMENT}
     * category, but the user has indicated that foreground apps are not allowed
     * to override the default payment service.
     * <li> If the service registers one or more AIDs in the {@link #CATEGORY_OTHER}
     * category that are also handled by the default payment service, and the
     * user has indicated that foreground apps are not allowed to override the
     * default payment service.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p> Use {@link #categoryAllowsForegroundPreference(String)} to determine
     * whether foreground apps can override the default payment service.
     *
     * <p>Note that this preference is not persisted by the OS, and hence must be
     * called every time the Activity is resumed.
     *
     * @param activity The activity which prefers this service to be invoked
     * @param service The service to be preferred while this activity is in the foreground
     * @return whether the registration was successful
