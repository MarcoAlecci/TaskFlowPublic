     * Enable multiple surfaces sharing the same OutputConfiguration
     *
     * <p>For advanced use cases, a camera application may require more streams than the combination
     * guaranteed by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}. In this case, more than one
     * compatible surface can be attached to an OutputConfiguration so that they map to one
     * camera stream, and the outputs share memory buffers when possible. Due to buffer sharing
     * clients should be careful when adding surface outputs that modify their input data. If such
     * case exists, camera clients should have an additional mechanism to synchronize read and write
     * access between individual consumers.</p>
     *
     * <p>Two surfaces are compatible in the below cases:</p>
     *
     * <li> Surfaces with the same size, format, dataSpace, and Surface source class. In this case,
     * {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations} is guaranteed to succeed.
     *
     * <li> Surfaces with the same size, format, and dataSpace, but different Surface source classes
     * that are generally not compatible. However, on some devices, the underlying camera device is
     * able to use the same buffer layout for both surfaces. The only way to discover if this is the
     * case is to create a capture session with that output configuration. For example, if the
     * camera device uses the same private buffer format between a SurfaceView/SurfaceTexture and a
     * MediaRecorder/MediaCodec, {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations}
     * will succeed. Otherwise, it fails with {@link
     * CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed}.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>To enable surface sharing, this function must be called before {@link
     * CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations} or {@link
     * CameraDevice#createReprocessableCaptureSessionByConfigurations}. Calling this function after
     * {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations} has no effect.</p>
     *
     * <p>Up to {@link #getMaxSharedSurfaceCount} surfaces can be shared for an OutputConfiguration.
     * The supported surfaces for sharing must be of type SurfaceTexture, SurfaceView,
     * MediaRecorder, MediaCodec, or implementation defined ImageReader.</p>
