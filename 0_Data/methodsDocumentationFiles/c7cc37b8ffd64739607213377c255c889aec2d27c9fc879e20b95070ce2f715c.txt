     * Report that Registration or a Location/Routing/Tracking Area update has failed.
     *
     * <p>Indicate whenever a registration procedure, including a location, routing, or tracking
     * area update fails. This includes procedures that do not necessarily result in a change of
     * the modem's registration status. If the modem's registration status changes, that is
     * reflected in the onNetworkStateChanged() and subsequent get{Voice/Data}RegistrationState().
     *
     * <p>Because registration failures are ephemeral, this callback is not sticky.
     * Registrants will not receive the most recent past value when registering.
     *
     * @param cellIdentity the CellIdentity, which must include the globally unique identifier
     *        for the cell (for example, all components of the CGI or ECGI).
     * @param chosenPlmn a 5 or 6 digit alphanumeric PLMN (MCC|MNC) among those broadcast by the
     *         cell that was chosen for the failed registration attempt.
     * @param domain DOMAIN_CS, DOMAIN_PS or both in case of a combined procedure.
     * @param causeCode the primary failure cause code of the procedure.
     *        For GSM/UMTS (MM), values are in TS 24.008 Sec 10.5.95
     *        For GSM/UMTS (GMM), values are in TS 24.008 Sec 10.5.147
     *        For LTE (EMM), cause codes are TS 24.301 Sec 9.9.3.9
     *        For NR (5GMM), cause codes are TS 24.501 Sec 9.11.3.2
     *        Integer.MAX_VALUE if this value is unused.
     * @param additionalCauseCode the cause code of any secondary/combined procedure if appropriate.
     *        For UMTS, if a combined attach succeeds for PS only, then the GMM cause code shall be
     *        included as an additionalCauseCode. For LTE (ESM), cause codes are in
     *        TS 24.301 9.9.4.4. Integer.MAX_VALUE if this value is unused.
