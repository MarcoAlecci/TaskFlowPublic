     * Sets the right-hand compound drawable of the TextView to the specified
     * icon and sets an error message that will be displayed in a popup when
     * the TextView has focus.  The icon and error message will be reset to
     * null when any key events cause changes to the TextView's text.  The
     * drawable must already have had {@link Drawable#setBounds} set on it.
     * If the <code>error</code> is <code>null</code>, the error message will
     * be cleared (and you should provide a <code>null</code> icon as well).
