     * Called by device or profile owner to force set a new device unlock password or a managed
     * profile challenge on current user. This takes effect immediately.
     * <p>
     * Unlike {@link #resetPassword}, this API can change the password even before the user or
     * device is unlocked or decrypted. The supplied token must have been previously provisioned via
     * {@link #setResetPasswordToken}, and in active state {@link #isResetPasswordTokenActive}.
     * <p>
     * The given password must be sufficient for the current password quality and length constraints
     * as returned by {@link #getPasswordQuality(ComponentName)} and
     * {@link #getPasswordMinimumLength(ComponentName)}; if it does not meet these constraints, then
     * it will be rejected and false returned. Note that the password may be a stronger quality, for
     * example, a password containing alphanumeric characters when the requested quality is only
     * numeric.
     * <p>
     * Calling with a {@code null} or empty password will clear any existing PIN, pattern or
     * password if the current password constraints allow it.
     * <p>On devices not supporting {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_SECURE_LOCK_SCREEN} feature,
     * calling this methods has no effect - the password is always empty - and false is returned.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param password The new password for the user. {@code null} or empty clears the password.
     * @param token the password reset token previously provisioned by
     *        {@link #setResetPasswordToken}.
     * @param flags May be 0 or combination of {@link #RESET_PASSWORD_REQUIRE_ENTRY} and
     *        {@link #RESET_PASSWORD_DO_NOT_ASK_CREDENTIALS_ON_BOOT}.
     * @return Returns true if the password was applied, or false if it is not acceptable for the
     *         current constraints.
     * @throws SecurityException if admin is not a device or profile owner.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the provided token is not valid.
