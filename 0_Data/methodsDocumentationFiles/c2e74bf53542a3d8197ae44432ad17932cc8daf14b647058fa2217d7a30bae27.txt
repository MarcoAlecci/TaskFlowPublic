     * Set the quality of the request.
     *
     * <p>Use with a accuracy constant such as {@link #ACCURACY_FINE}, or a power
     * constant such as {@link #POWER_LOW}. You cannot request both accuracy and
     * power, only one or the other can be specified. The system will then
     * maximize accuracy or minimize power as appropriate.
     *
     * <p>The quality of the request is a strong hint to the system for which
     * location sources to use. For example, {@link #ACCURACY_FINE} is more likely
     * to use GPS, and {@link #POWER_LOW} is more likely to use WIFI & Cell tower
     * positioning, but it also depends on many other factors (such as which sources
     * are available) and is implementation dependent.
     *
     * <p>{@link #setQuality} and {@link #setInterval} are the most important parameters
     * on a location request.
     *
     * @param quality an accuracy or power constant
     * @return the same object, so that setters can be chained
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the quality constant is not valid
