     * Method to parse target physical address to the port number on the current device.
     *
     * <p>This check assumes target address is valid.
     *
     * @param targetPhysicalAddress is the physical address of the target device
     * @param myPhysicalAddress is the physical address of the current device
     * @return
     * If the target device is under the current device, return the port number of current device
     * that the target device is connected to. This also applies to the devices that are indirectly
     * connected to the current device.
     *
     * <p>If the target device has the same physical address as the current device, return
     * {@link #TARGET_SAME_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS}.
     *
     * <p>If the target device is not under the current device, return
     * {@link #TARGET_NOT_UNDER_LOCAL_DEVICE}.
