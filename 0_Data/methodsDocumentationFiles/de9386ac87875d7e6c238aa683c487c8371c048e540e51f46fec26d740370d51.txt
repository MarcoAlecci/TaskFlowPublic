     * Don't call or override this method. It is used for the implementation of
     * the view hierarchy.
     *
     * This implementation returns null if this ViewGroup does not have a parent,
     * if this ViewGroup is already fully invalidated or if the dirty rectangle
     * does not intersect with this ViewGroup's bounds.
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #onDescendantInvalidated(View, View)} instead to observe updates to
     * draw state in descendants.
