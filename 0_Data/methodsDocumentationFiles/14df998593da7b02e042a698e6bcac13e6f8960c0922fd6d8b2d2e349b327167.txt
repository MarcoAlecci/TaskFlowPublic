     * Sets the node after which this one is visited in accessibility traversal.
     * A screen-reader must visit the content of the other node before the content
     * of this one. If <code>virtualDescendantId</code> equals to {@link View#NO_ID}
     * the root is set as the predecessor.
     * <p>
     * A virtual descendant is an imaginary View that is reported as a part of the view
     * hierarchy for accessibility purposes. This enables custom views that draw complex
     * content to report them selves as a tree of virtual views, thus conveying their
     * logical structure.
