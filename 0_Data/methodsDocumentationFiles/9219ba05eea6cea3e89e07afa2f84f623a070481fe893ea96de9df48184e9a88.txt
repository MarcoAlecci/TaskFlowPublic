         * indicates that the app may prepare any music. The implementation should attempt to make a
         * smart choice about what to play. During the preparation, a session should not hold audio
         * focus in order to allow other sessions play seamlessly. The state of playback should be
         * updated to {@link PlaybackState#STATE_PAUSED} after the preparation is done. The playback
         * of the prepared content should start in the implementation of {@link #onPlay}. Override
         * {@link #onPlayFromSearch} to handle requests for starting playback without preparation.
