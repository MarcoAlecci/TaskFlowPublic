     * Implement this to handle requests to update one or more rows. The
     * implementation should update all rows matching the selection to set the
     * columns according to the provided values map. As a courtesy, call
     * {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(android.net.Uri ,android.database.ContentObserver)
     * notifyChange()} after updating. This method can be called from multiple
     * threads, as described in <a href="
     * {@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     *

     * @param values A set of column_name/value pairs to update in the database.
     * @param selection An optional filter to match rows to update.
