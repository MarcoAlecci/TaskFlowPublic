     * Overrides the carrier config of the provided subscription ID with the provided values.
     *
     * Any further queries to carrier config from any process will return the overridden values
     * after this method returns. The overrides are effective for the lifetime of the phone process
     * until the user passes in {@code null} for {@code overrideValues}. This removes all previous
     * overrides and sets the carrier config back to production values.
     *
     * May throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException} if {@code overrideValues} contains invalid
     * values for the specified config keys.
     *

     *
     * @param subscriptionId The subscription ID for which the override should be done.
     * @param overrideValues Key-value pairs of the values that are to be overridden. If set to
     *                       {@code null}, this will remove all previous overrides and set the
     *                       carrier configuration back to production values.
