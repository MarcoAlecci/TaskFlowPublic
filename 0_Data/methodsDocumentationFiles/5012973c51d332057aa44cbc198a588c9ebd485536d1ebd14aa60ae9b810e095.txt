     * Returns the string representation of this {@code FileTime}. The string
     * is returned in the <a
     * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">ISO&nbsp;8601</a> format:
     * <pre>
     *     YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.s+]Z
     * </pre>
     * where "{@code [.s+]}" represents a dot followed by one of more digits
     * for the decimal fraction of a second. It is only present when the decimal
     * fraction of a second is not zero. For example, {@code
     * FileTime.fromMillis(1234567890000L).toString()} yields {@code
     * "2009-02-13T23:31:30Z"}, and {@code FileTime.fromMillis(1234567890123L).toString()}
     * yields {@code "2009-02-13T23:31:30.123Z"}.
     *
     * <p> A {@code FileTime} is primarily intended to represent the value of a
     * file's time stamp. Where used to represent <i>extreme values</i>, where
     * the year is less than "{@code 0001}" or greater than "{@code 9999}" then
     * this method deviates from ISO 8601 in the same manner as the
     * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#deviantformats">XML Schema
     * language</a>. That is, the year may be expanded to more than four digits
     * and may be negative-signed. If more than four digits then leading zeros
     * are not present. The year before "{@code 0001}" is "{@code -0001}".
     *
     * @return  the string representation of this file time
