     * Sets the audio encoding bit rate for recording. Call this method before prepare().
     * Prepare() may perform additional checks on the parameter to make sure whether the
     * specified bit rate is applicable, and sometimes the passed bitRate will be clipped
     * internally to ensure the audio recording can proceed smoothly based on the
     * capabilities of the platform.
     *
     * @param bitRate the audio encoding bit rate in bits per second.
