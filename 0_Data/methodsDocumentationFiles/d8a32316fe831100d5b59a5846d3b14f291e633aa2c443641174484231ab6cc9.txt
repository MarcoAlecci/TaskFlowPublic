     *
     * <p> Each user has its own backup service which manages the backup and restore mechanisms in
     * that user. Disabling the backup service will prevent data from being backed up or restored.
     *
     * <p> Device owner calls this API to control backup services across all users on the device.
     * Profile owner can use this API to enable or disable the profile's backup service. However,
     * for a managed profile its backup functionality is only enabled if both the device owner
     * and the profile owner have enabled the backup service.
     *
     * <p> By default, backup service is disabled on a device with device owner, and within a
     * managed profile.
     *
