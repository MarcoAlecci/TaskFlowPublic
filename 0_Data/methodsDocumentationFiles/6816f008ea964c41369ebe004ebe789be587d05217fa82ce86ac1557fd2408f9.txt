     * Default implementation of
     * {@link android.view.Window.Callback#onCreatePanelMenu}
     * for activities.  This calls through to the new
     * {@link #onCreateOptionsMenu} method for the
     * {@link android.view.Window#FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL} panel,
     * so that subclasses of Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.
