     * Finds {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo}s by text. The match is case
     * insensitive containment. The search is relative to this info i.e.
     * this info is the root of the traversed tree.

     * <p>
     *   <strong>Note:</strong> It is a client responsibility to recycle the
     *     received info by calling {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo#recycle()}
     *     to avoid creating of multiple instances.

     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> If this view hierarchy has a {@link SurfaceView} embedding another
     * view hierarchy via {@link SurfaceView#setChildSurfacePackage}, there is a limitation that
     * this API won't be able to find the node for the view on the embedded view hierarchy. It's
     * because views don't know about the embedded hierarchies. Instead, you could traverse all
     * the children to find the node.

     * @param text The searched text.
     * @return A list of node info.
