     * Create a new {@link PrecomputedText} which will pre-compute text measurement and glyph
     * positioning information.
     * <p>
     * This can be expensive, so computing this on a background thread before your text will be
     * presented can save work on the UI thread.
     * </p>
     *
     * Note that any {@link android.text.NoCopySpan} attached to the text won't be passed to the
     * created PrecomputedText.
     *
     * @param text the text to be measured
     * @param params parameters that define how text will be precomputed
     * @return A {@link PrecomputedText}
