     * Return number of bytes received since device boot. Counts packets across
     * all network interfaces, and always increases monotonically since device
     * boot. Statistics are measured at the network layer, so they include both
     * TCP and UDP usage.
     * <p>
     * Before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN_MR2}, this may
     * return {@link #UNSUPPORTED} on devices where statistics aren't available.
