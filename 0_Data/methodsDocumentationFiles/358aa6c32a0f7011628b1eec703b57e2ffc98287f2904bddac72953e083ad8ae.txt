     * with at least the specified depthSize and stencilSize,
     * and exactly the specified redSize, greenSize, blueSize and alphaSize.
     * <p>If this method is
     * called, it must be called before {@link #setRenderer(Renderer)}
     * is called.
     * <p>
     * If no setEGLConfigChooser method is called, then by default the
     * view will choose an RGB_888 surface with a depth buffer depth of
     * at least 16 bits.
