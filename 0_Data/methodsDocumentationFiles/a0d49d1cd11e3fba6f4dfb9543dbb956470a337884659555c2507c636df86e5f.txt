     * Similar to Objects.deepEquals, but also take care of lists.
     * Two objects of HIDL types are considered equal if:
     * 1. Both null
     * 2. Both non-null, and of the same class, and:
     * 2.1 Both are primitive arrays / enum arrays, elements are equal using == check
     * 2.2 Both are object arrays, elements are checked recursively
     * 2.3 Both are Lists, elements are checked recursively
     * 2.4 (If both are collections other than lists or maps, throw an error)
     * 2.5 lft.equals(rgt) returns true
