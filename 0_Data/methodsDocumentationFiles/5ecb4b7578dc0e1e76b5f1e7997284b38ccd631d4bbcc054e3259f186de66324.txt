     * Get the current password expiration time for a particular admin or all admins that set
     * restrictions on this user and its participating profiles. Restrictions on profiles that have
     * a separate challenge are not taken into account. If admin is {@code null}, then a composite
     * of all expiration times is returned - which will be the minimum of all of them.
     *
     * <p>This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance
     * returned by {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to retrieve
     * the password expiration for the parent profile.
     *
     * <p>On devices not supporting {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_SECURE_LOCK_SCREEN} feature, the
     * password expiration is always disabled and this method always returns 0.
     *
     * @param admin The name of the admin component to check, or {@code null} to aggregate all admins.
     * @return The password expiration time, in milliseconds since epoch.
