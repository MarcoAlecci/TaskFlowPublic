     *                     with this mechanism is generally expensive to retrieve, so should only be
     *                     requested when needed. See

     * @param args A bundle of arguments for the request. These depend on the particular request.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the refresh succeeded. {@code false} if the {@link View} represented
     * by this node is no longer in the view tree (and thus this node is obsolete and should be
     * recycled).
