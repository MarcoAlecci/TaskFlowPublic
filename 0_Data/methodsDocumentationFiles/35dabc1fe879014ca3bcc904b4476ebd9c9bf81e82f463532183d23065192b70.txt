     * Initialize data injection mode and create a client for data injection. SensorService should
     * already be operating in DATA_INJECTION mode for this call succeed. To set SensorService into
     * DATA_INJECTION mode "adb shell dumpsys sensorservice data_injection" needs to be called
     * through adb. Typically this is done using a host side test.  This mode is expected to be used
     * only for testing purposes. If the HAL is set to data injection mode, it will ignore the input
     * from physical sensors and read sensor data that is injected from the test application. This
     * mode is used for testing vendor implementations for various algorithms like Rotation Vector,
     * Significant Motion, Step Counter etc. Not all HALs support DATA_INJECTION. This method will
     * fail in those cases. Once this method succeeds, the test can call
     * {@link injectSensorData(Sensor, float[], int, long)} to inject sensor data into the HAL.
