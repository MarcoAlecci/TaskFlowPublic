         * magnification scale and center only affect this portion of the screen. The rest of the
         * screen, for example input methods, cannot be magnified. This region is relative to the
         * unscaled screen and is independent of the scale and center point.
         * <p>
         * The returned region will be empty if magnification is not active. Magnification is active
         * if magnification gestures are enabled or if a service is running that can control
         * magnification.
         * <p>
         * <strong>Note:</strong> If the service is not yet connected (e.g.
         * {@link AccessibilityService#onServiceConnected()} has not yet been
         * called) or the service has been disconnected, this method will
         * return an empty region.
         *
         * @return the region of the screen currently active for magnification, or an empty region
         * if magnification is not active.
