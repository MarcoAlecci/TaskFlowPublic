     * Test whether this filter matches the given intent data.  A match is
     * only successful if the actions and categories in the Intent match
     * against the filter, as described in {@link IntentFilter}; in that case,
     * the match result returned will be as per {@link #matchData}.
     *
     * @param action The intent action to match against (Intent.getAction).
     * @param type The intent type to match against (Intent.resolveType()).
     * @param scheme The data scheme to match against (Intent.getScheme()).
     * @param data The data URI to match against (Intent.getData()).
     * @param categories The categories to match against
     *                   (Intent.getCategories()).
     * @param logTag Tag to use in debugging messages.
     *
     * @return Returns either a valid match constant (a combination of
     * {@link #MATCH_CATEGORY_MASK} and {@link #MATCH_ADJUSTMENT_MASK}),
     * or one of the error codes {@link #NO_MATCH_TYPE} if the type didn't match,
     * {@link #NO_MATCH_DATA} if the scheme/path didn't match,
     * {@link #NO_MATCH_ACTION} if the action didn't match, or
     * {@link #NO_MATCH_CATEGORY} if one or more categories didn't match.
