         * <p>Gets the current focus areas. Camera driver uses the areas to decide
         * focus.</p>
         *
         * <p>Before using this API or {@link #setFocusAreas(List)}, apps should
         * call {@link #getMaxNumFocusAreas()} to know the maximum number of
         * focus areas first. If the value is 0, focus area is not supported.</p>
         *
         * <p>Each focus area is a rectangle with specified weight. The direction
         * is relative to the sensor orientation, that is, what the sensor sees.
         * The direction is not affected by the rotation or mirroring of
         * {@link #setDisplayOrientation(int)}. Coordinates of the rectangle
         * range from -1000 to 1000. (-1000, -1000) is the upper left point.
         * (1000, 1000) is the lower right point. The width and height of focus
         * areas cannot be 0 or negative.</p>
         *
         * <p>The weight must range from 1 to 1000. The weight should be
         * interpreted as a per-pixel weight - all pixels in the area have the
         * specified weight. This means a small area with the same weight as a
         * larger area will have less influence on the focusing than the larger
         * area. Focus areas can partially overlap and the driver will add the
         * weights in the overlap region.</p>
         *
         * <p>A special case of a {@code null} focus area list means the driver is
         * free to select focus targets as it wants. For example, the driver may
         * use more signals to select focus areas and change them
         * dynamically. Apps can set the focus area list to {@code null} if they
         * want the driver to completely control focusing.</p>
         *
         * <p>Focus areas are relative to the current field of view
         * ({@link #getZoom()}). No matter what the zoom level is, (-1000,-1000)
         * represents the top of the currently visible camera frame. The focus
         * area cannot be set to be outside the current field of view, even
         * when using zoom.</p>
         *
         * <p>Focus area only has effect if the current focus mode is
         * {@link #FOCUS_MODE_AUTO}, {@link #FOCUS_MODE_MACRO},
         * {@link #FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO}, or
         * {@link #FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_PICTURE}.</p>
         *
