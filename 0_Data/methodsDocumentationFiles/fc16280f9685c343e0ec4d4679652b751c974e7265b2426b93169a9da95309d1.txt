     * Enable more aggressive scheduling for latency-sensitive low-runtime VR threads that persist
     * beyond a single process. Only one thread can be a
     * persistent VR thread at a time, and that thread may be subject to restrictions on the amount
     * of time it can run. Calling this method will disable aggressive scheduling for non-persistent
     * VR threads set via {@link #setVrThread}. If persistent VR mode is disabled then the
     * persistent VR thread loses its new scheduling priority; this method must be called again to
     * set the persistent thread.
     *
     * To reset the persistent VR thread, a tid of 0 can be passed.

     * @see android.os.Process#myTid()
     * @param tid tid of the VR thread
