     * Check if the {@code type} contains a {@link TypeVariable} recursively.
     *
     * <p>Intuitively, a type variable is a type in a type expression that refers to a generic
     * type which is not known at the definition of the expression (commonly seen when
     * type parameters are used, e.g. {@code class Foo<T>}).</p>

     * for a more formal definition of a type variable</p>.

     * @param type a type object ({@code null} is allowed)
     * @return {@code true} if there were nested type variables; {@code false} otherwise
