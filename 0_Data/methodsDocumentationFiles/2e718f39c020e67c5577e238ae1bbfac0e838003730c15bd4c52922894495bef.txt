         * Calculates the item decor insets applied to the given child and updates the provided
         * Rect instance with the inset values.
         * <ul>
         *     <li>The Rect's left is set to the total width of left decorations.</li>
         *     <li>The Rect's top is set to the total height of top decorations.</li>
         *     <li>The Rect's right is set to the total width of right decorations.</li>
         *     <li>The Rect's bottom is set to total height of bottom decorations.</li>
         * </ul>
         * <p>
         * Note that item decorations are automatically calculated when one of the LayoutManager's
         * measure child methods is called. If you need to measure the child with custom specs via
         * {@link View#measure(int, int)}, you can use this method to get decorations.
         *
         * @param child The child view whose decorations should be calculated
         * @param outRect The Rect to hold result values
