     * Check if the current Element is compatible with another Element.
     * Primitive Elements are compatible if they share the same underlying
     * size and type (i.e. U8 is compatible with A_8). User-defined Elements
     * must be equal in order to be compatible. This requires strict name
     * equivalence for all sub-Elements (in addition to structural equivalence).
     *
     * @param e The Element to check compatibility with.
     *
     * @return boolean true if the Elements are compatible, otherwise false.
