         * The default implementation splits the input text to words and returns
         * {@link SentenceSuggestionsInfo} which contains suggestions for each word.
         * This function will run on the incoming IPC thread.
         * So, this is not called on the main thread,
         * but will be called in series on another thread.
         * When you override this method, make sure that suggestionsLimit is applied to suggestions
         * that share the same start position and length.
         * @param textInfos an array of the text metadata
         * @param suggestionsLimit the maximum number of suggestions to be returned
         * @return an array of {@link SentenceSuggestionsInfo} returned by
         * {@link SpellCheckerService.Session#onGetSuggestions(TextInfo, int)}
