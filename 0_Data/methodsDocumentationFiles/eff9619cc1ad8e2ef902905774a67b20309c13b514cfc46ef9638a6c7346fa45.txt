     * Apps can use this method to find out if the device was provisioned as
     * organization-owend device with a managed profile.
     *
     * This, together with checking whether the device has a device owner (by calling
     * {@link #isDeviceOwnerApp}), could be used to learn whether the device is owned by an
     * organization or an individual:
     * If this method returns true OR {@link #isDeviceOwnerApp} returns true (for any package),
     * then the device is owned by an organization. Otherwise, it's owned by an individual.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the device was provisioned as organization-owned device,
     * {@code false} otherwise.
