     * emergency service, for the country that the user is in. The current
     * country is determined using the CountryDetector.
     *
     * Specifically, this method will return true if the specified number
     * is an emergency number in the current country, *or* if the number
     * simply starts with the same digits as any emergency number for the
     * current country.
     *
     * This method is intended for internal use by the phone app when
     * deciding whether to allow ACTION_CALL intents from 3rd party apps
     * (where we're required to *not* allow emergency calls to be placed.)
     *
     * @param number the number to look up.
     * @param context the specific context which the number should be checked against
     * @return true if the specified number is an emergency number for a local country, based on the
     *              CountryDetector.
