     * Call this method to start a text classification session with the given context.
     * A session is created with a context helping the classifier better understand
     * what the user needs and consists of queries and feedback events. The queries
     * are directly related to providing useful functionality to the user and the events
     * are a feedback loop back to the classifier helping it learn and better serve
     * future queries.
     *
     * <p> All interactions with the returned classifier are considered part of a single
     * session and are logically grouped. For example, when a text widget is focused
     * all user interactions around text editing (selection, editing, etc) can be
     * grouped together to allow the classifier get better.
     *
     * @param classificationContext The context in which classification would occur
