     * Set the action bar into a "transitioning" state. While transitioning
     * the bar will block focus and touch from all of its descendants. This
     * prevents the user from interacting with the bar while it is animating
     * in or out.
     *
     * @param isTransitioning true if the bar is currently transitioning, false otherwise.
