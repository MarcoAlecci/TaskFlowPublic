     * Implement this to handle requests to insert a new row. As a courtesy,
     * call
     * {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(android.net.Uri ,android.database.ContentObserver)
     * notifyChange()} after inserting. This method can be called from multiple
     * threads, as described in <a href="
     * {@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     *
     * @param uri The content:// URI of the insertion request.
     * @param values A set of column_name/value pairs to add to the database.
     * @param extras A Bundle containing additional information necessary for
     *            the operation. Arguments may include SQL style arguments, such
     *            as {@link ContentResolver#QUERY_ARG_SQL_LIMIT}, but note that
     *            the documentation for each individual provider will indicate
     *            which arguments they support.
     * @return The URI for the newly inserted item.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the provider doesn't support one of
     *             the requested Bundle arguments.
