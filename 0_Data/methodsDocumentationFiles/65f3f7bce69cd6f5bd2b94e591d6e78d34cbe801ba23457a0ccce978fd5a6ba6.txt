     * Returns current ranking information.
     *
     * <p>
     * The returned object represents the current ranking snapshot and only
     * applies for currently active notifications.
     * <p>
     * Generally you should use the RankingMap that is passed with events such
     * as {@link #onNotificationPosted(StatusBarNotification, RankingMap)},
     * {@link #onNotificationRemoved(StatusBarNotification, RankingMap)}, and
     * so on. This method should only be used when needing access outside of
     * such events, for example to retrieve the RankingMap right after
     * initialization.
     *
     * <p>The service should wait for the {@link #onListenerConnected()} event
     * before performing this operation.
