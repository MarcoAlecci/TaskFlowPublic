     * Queues the specified segment in the JET queue.
     * @param segmentNum the identifier of the segment.
     * @param libNum the index of the sound bank associated with the segment. Use -1 to indicate
     *    that no sound bank (DLS file) is associated with this segment, in which case JET will use
     *    the General MIDI library.
     * @param repeatCount the number of times the segment will be repeated. 0 means the segment will
     *    only play once. -1 means the segment will repeat indefinitely.
     * @param transpose the amount of pitch transposition. Set to 0 for normal playback. 
     *    Range is -12 to +12.
     * @param muteFlags a bitmask to specify which MIDI tracks will be muted during playback. Bit 0
     *    affects track 0, bit 1 affects track 1 etc.
     * @param userID a value specified by the application that uniquely identifies the segment. 
     *    this value is received in the
     *    {@link OnJetEventListener#onJetUserIdUpdate(JetPlayer, int, int)} event listener method.
     *    Normally, the application will keep a byte value that is incremented each time a new
     *    segment is queued up. This can be used to look up any special characteristics of that
     *    track including trigger clips and mute flags.
     * @return true if the segment was successfully queued, false if the queue is full or if the
     *    parameters are invalid.
