     *  Dynamically sets the output surface of a codec.
     *  <p>
     *  This can only be used if the codec was configured with an output surface.  The
     *  new output surface should have a compatible usage type to the original output surface.
     *  E.g. codecs may not support switching from a SurfaceTexture (GPU readable) output
     *  to ImageReader (software readable) output.
     *  @param surface the output surface to use. It must not be {@code null}.
     *  @throws IllegalStateException if the codec does not support setting the output
     *            surface in the current state.
     *  @throws IllegalArgumentException if the new surface is not of a suitable type for the codec.
