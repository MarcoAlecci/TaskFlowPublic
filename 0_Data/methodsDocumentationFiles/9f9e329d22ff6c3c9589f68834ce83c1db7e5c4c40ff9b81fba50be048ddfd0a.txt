     * Return whether the given user is actively running <em>or</em> stopping.
     * This is like {@link #isUserRunning(UserHandle)}, but will also return
     * true if the user had been running but is in the process of being stopped
     * (but is not yet fully stopped, and still running some code).
     *
     * <p>Note prior to Android Nougat MR1 (SDK version <= 24;
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N}, this API required a system permission
     * in order to check other profile's status.
     * Since Android Nougat MR1 (SDK version >= 25;
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N_MR1}), the restriction has been relaxed, and now
     * it'll accept any {@link android.os.UserHandle} within the same profile group as the caller.
     *
     * @param user The user to retrieve the running state for.
