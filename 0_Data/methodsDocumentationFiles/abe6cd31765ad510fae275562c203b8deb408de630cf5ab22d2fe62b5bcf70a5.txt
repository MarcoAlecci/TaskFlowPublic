     * <p>Installs a callback to be invoked for every preview frame in addition
     * to displaying them on the screen.  The callback will be repeatedly called
     * for as long as preview is active.  This method can be called at any time,
     * even while preview is live.  Any other preview callbacks are
     * overridden.</p>
     *
     * <p>If you are using the preview data to create video or still images,
     * strongly consider using {@link android.media.MediaActionSound} to
     * properly indicate image capture or recording start/stop to the user.</p>
     *
     * @param cb a callback object that receives a copy of each preview frame,
     *     or null to stop receiving callbacks.
     * @throws RuntimeException if release() has been called on this Camera
     *     instance.
