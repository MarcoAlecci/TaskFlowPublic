     * Gets the difference between hardware clock ({@link #getTimeNanos()}) inside GPS receiver and
     * the true GPS time since 0000Z, January 6, 1980, in nanoseconds.
     *
     * <p>This value is available if the receiver has estimated GPS time. If the computed time is
     * for a non-GPS constellation, the time offset of that constellation to GPS has to be applied
     * to fill this value. The value is only available if {@link #hasFullBiasNanos()} is
     * {@code true}.
     *
     * <p>The error estimate for the sum of this field and {@link #getBiasNanos} is
     * {@link #getBiasUncertaintyNanos()}.
     *
     * <p>The sign of the value is defined by the following equation:
     *
     * <pre>
     *     local estimate of GPS time = TimeNanos - (FullBiasNanos + BiasNanos)</pre>
