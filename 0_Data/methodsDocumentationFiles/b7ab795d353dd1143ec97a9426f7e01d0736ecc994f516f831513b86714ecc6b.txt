     * Retrieve and hold the contents of the preferences file 'name', returning
     * a SharedPreferences through which you can retrieve and modify its
     * values.  Only one instance of the SharedPreferences object is returned
     * to any callers for the same name, meaning they will see each other's
     * edits as soon as they are made.
     *
     * <p>This method is thread-safe.
     *
     * <p>If the preferences directory does not already exist, it will be created when this method
     * is called.
     *
     * <p>If a preferences file by this name does not exist, it will be created when you retrieve an
     * editor ({@link SharedPreferences#edit()}) and then commit changes ({@link
     * SharedPreferences.Editor#commit()} or {@link SharedPreferences.Editor#apply()}).
     *
     * @param name Desired preferences file.
     * @param mode Operating mode.
     *
     * @return The single {@link SharedPreferences} instance that can be used
     *         to retrieve and modify the preference values.
