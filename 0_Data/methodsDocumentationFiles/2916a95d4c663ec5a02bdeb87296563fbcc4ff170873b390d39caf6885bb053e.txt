     * Update the {@code result} camera metadata map with the new value for the
     * {@code statistics.faces} and {@code statistics.faceDetectMode}.
     *
     * <p>Face detect callbacks are processed in the background, and each call to
     * {@link #mapResultFaces} will have the latest faces as reflected by the camera1 callbacks.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the scene mode was set to {@code FACE_PRIORITY} but face detection is disabled,
     * the camera will still run face detection in the background, but no faces will be reported
     * in the capture result.</p>
     *
     * @param result a non-{@code null} result
     * @param legacyRequest a non-{@code null} request (read-only)
