     * Called when the trackball was moved and not handled by any of the
     * views inside of the activity.  So, for example, if the trackball moves
     * while focus is on a button, you will receive a call here because
     * buttons do not normally do anything with trackball events.  The call
     * here happens <em>before</em> trackball movements are converted to
     * DPAD key events, which then get sent back to the view hierarchy, and
     * will be processed at the point for things like focus navigation.
     * 
     * @param event The trackball event being processed.
     * 
     * @return Return true if you have consumed the event, false if you haven't.
     * The default implementation always returns false.
