     * Efficient way to pop any calls to save() that happened after the save
     * count reached saveCount. It is an error for saveCount to be less than 1.
     *
     * Example:
     *    int count = canvas.save();
     *    ... // more calls potentially to save()
     *    canvas.restoreToCount(count);
     *    // now the canvas is back in the same state it was before the initial
     *    // call to save().
     *
     * @param saveCount The save level to restore to.
