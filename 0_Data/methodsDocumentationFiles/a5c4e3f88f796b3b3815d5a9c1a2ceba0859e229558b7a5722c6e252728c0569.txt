     * Merges all {@link RemoteConnection}s of this conference into a single call. This should be
     * invoked only if the conference contains the capability
     * {@link Connection#CAPABILITY_MERGE_CONFERENCE}, otherwise it is a no-op. The presence of said
     * capability indicates that the connections of this conference, despite being part of the
     * same conference object, are yet to have their audio streams merged; this is a common pattern
     * for CDMA conference calls, but the capability is not used for GSM and SIP conference calls.
     * Invoking this method will cause the unmerged child connections to merge their audio
     * streams.
