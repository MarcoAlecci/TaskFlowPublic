     * Close the connection to this camera device as quickly as possible.
     *
     * <p>Immediately after this call, all calls to the camera device or active session interface
     * will throw a {@link IllegalStateException}, except for calls to close(). Once the device has
     * fully shut down, the {@link StateCallback#onClosed} callback will be called, and the camera
     * is free to be re-opened.</p>
     *
     * <p>Immediately after this call, besides the final {@link StateCallback#onClosed} calls, no
     * further callbacks from the device or the active session will occur, and any remaining
     * submitted capture requests will be discarded, as if
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession#abortCaptures} had been called, except that no success or failure
     * callbacks will be invoked.</p>
