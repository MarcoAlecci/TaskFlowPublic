     * Sets the Outline to a
     * {@link android.graphics.Path#isConvex() convex path}.
     *
     * @param convexPath used to construct the Outline. As of
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}, it is no longer required to be
     * convex.
     *
     * @deprecated As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}, the restriction
     * that the path must be convex is removed. However, the API is misnamed until
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R}, when {@link #setPath} is
     * introduced. Use {@link #setPath} instead.
