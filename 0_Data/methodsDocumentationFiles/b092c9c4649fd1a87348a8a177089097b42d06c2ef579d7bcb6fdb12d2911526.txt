     * Returns the private DNS server name that is in use. If not {@code null},
     * private DNS is in strict mode. In this mode, applications should ensure
     * that all DNS queries are encrypted and sent to this hostname and that
     * queries are only sent if the hostname's certificate is valid. If
     * {@code null} and {@link #isPrivateDnsActive} is {@code true}, private
     * DNS is in opportunistic mode, and applications should ensure that DNS
     * queries are encrypted and sent to a DNS server returned by
     * {@link #getDnsServers}. System DNS will handle each of these cases
     * correctly, but applications implementing their own DNS lookups must make
     * sure to follow these requirements.

     * @return The private DNS server name.
