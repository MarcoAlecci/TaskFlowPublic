     * Configures the audio framework so that all audio streams originating from the given user
     * can only come from a set of audio devices.
     * For this routing to be operational, a number of {@link AudioMix} instances must have been
     * previously registered on this policy, and routed to a super-set of the given audio devices
     * with {@link AudioMix.Builder#setDevice(android.media.AudioDeviceInfo)}. Note that having
     * multiple devices in the list doesn't imply the signals will be duplicated on the different
     * audio devices, final routing will depend on the {@link AudioAttributes} of the sounds being
     * played.
     * @param userId userId of the application affected, as obtained via
     * {@link UserHandle#getIdentifier}. Not to be confused with application uid.
     * @param devices list of devices to which the audio stream of the application may be routed.
     * @return true if the change was successful, false otherwise.
