     * Sets the {@code Set} of initial policy identifiers
     * (OID strings), indicating that any one of these
     * policies would be acceptable to the certificate user for the purposes of
     * certification path processing. By default, any policy is acceptable
     * (i.e. all policies), so a user that wants to allow any policy as
     * acceptable does not need to call this method, or can call it
     * with an empty {@code Set} (or {@code null}).
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code Set} is copied to protect against
     * subsequent modifications.
