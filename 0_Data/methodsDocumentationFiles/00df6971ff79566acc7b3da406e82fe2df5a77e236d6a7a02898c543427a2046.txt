     *
     * <p>In case a VPN is used in conjunction with Private DNS resolver, the Private DNS resolver
     * must be reachable both from within and outside the VPN. Otherwise, the device may lose
     * the ability to resolve hostnames as system traffic to the resolver may not go through the
     * VPN.
