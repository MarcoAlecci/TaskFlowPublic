     * Commit the last finished undo state.  This undo state can no longer be
     * modified with further {@link #MERGE_MODE_UNIQUE} or
     * {@link #MERGE_MODE_ANY} merge modes.  If called while inside of an update,
     * this will push any changes in the current update on to the undo stack
     * and result with a fresh undo state, behaving as if {@link #endUpdate()}
     * had been called enough to unwind the current update, then the last state
     * committed, and {@link #beginUpdate} called to restore the update nesting.
     * @param owner The optional owner to determine whether to perform the commit.
     * If this is non-null, the commit will only execute if the current top undo
     * state contains an operation with the given owner.
     * @return Returns an integer identifier for the committed undo state, which
     * can later be used to try to uncommit the state to perform further edits on it.
