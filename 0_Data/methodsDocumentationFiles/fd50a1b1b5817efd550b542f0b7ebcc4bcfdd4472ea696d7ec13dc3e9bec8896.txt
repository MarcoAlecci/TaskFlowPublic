     * Requests the GNSS chipset to run in a low power mode and make strong tradeoffs to
     * substantially restrict power.
     *
     * <p>In this mode, the GNSS chipset will not, on average, run power hungry operations like RF &
     * signal searches for more than one second per interval (specified by
     * {@link #setInterval(long)}).
     *
     * @param enabled Enable or disable low power mode
     * @return the same object, so that setters can be chained
