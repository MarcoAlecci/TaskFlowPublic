    * <p>
    * When this mode is supported, it is possible to perform call screening and monitoring
    * functions while other use cases like music or movie playback are active.
    * <p>
    * Use {@link #setMode(int)} with mode {@link #MODE_CALL_SCREENING} to place the platform in
    * call screening mode.
    * <p>
    * If call screening mode is not supported, setting mode to
    * MODE_CALL_SCREENING will be ignored and will not change current mode reported by
    *  {@link #getMode()}.
    * @return true if call screening mode is supported, false otherwise.
