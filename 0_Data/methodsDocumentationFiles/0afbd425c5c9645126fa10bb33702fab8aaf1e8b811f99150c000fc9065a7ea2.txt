     * Builds an {@link Intent#ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE} to allow the user to grant access to any
     * directory subtree (or entire volume) from the {@link android.provider.DocumentsProvider}s
     * available on the device. The initial location of the document navigation will be the root of
     * this {@link StorageVolume}.
     *
     * Note that the returned {@link Intent} simply suggests that the user picks this {@link
     * StorageVolume} by default, but the user may select a different location. Callers must respect
     * the user's chosen location, even if it is different from the originally requested location.
     *
     * @return intent to {@link Intent#ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE} initially showing the contents
     *         of this {@link StorageVolume}
