     * Return the ViewHolder for the item with the given id. The RecyclerView must
     * use an Adapter with {@link Adapter#setHasStableIds(boolean) stableIds} to
     * return a non-null value.
     * <p>
     * This method checks only the children of RecyclerView. If the item with the given
     * <code>id</code> is not laid out, it <em>will not</em> create a new one.
     *
     * When the ItemAnimator is running a change animation, there might be 2 ViewHolders with the
     * same id. In this case, the updated ViewHolder will be returned.
     *
     * @param id The id for the requested item
     * @return The ViewHolder with the given <code>id</code> or null if there is no such item
