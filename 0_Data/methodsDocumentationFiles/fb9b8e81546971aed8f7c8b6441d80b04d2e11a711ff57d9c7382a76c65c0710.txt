     * Returns absolute paths to application-specific directories on all
     * shared/external storage devices where the application can place cache
     * files it owns. These files are internal to the application, and not
     * typically visible to the user as media.
     * <p>
     * This is like {@link #getCacheDir()} in that these files will be deleted
     * when the application is uninstalled, however there are some important
     * differences:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The platform does not always monitor the space available in shared
     * storage, and thus may not automatically delete these files. Apps should
     * always manage the maximum space used in this location. Currently the only
     * time files here will be deleted by the platform is when running on
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN_MR1} or later and
     * {@link Environment#isExternalStorageEmulated(File)} returns true.
     * <li>Shared storage may not always be available, since removable media can
     * be ejected by the user. Media state can be checked using
     * {@link Environment#getExternalStorageState(File)}.
     * <li>There is no security enforced with these files. For example, any
     * application holding
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} can write to
     * these files.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If a shared storage device is emulated (as determined by
     * {@link Environment#isExternalStorageEmulated(File)}), it's contents are
     * backed by a private user data partition, which means there is little
     * benefit to storing data here instead of the private directory returned by
     * {@link #getCacheDir()}.
     * <p>
     * Shared storage devices returned here are considered a stable part of the
     * device, including physical media slots under a protective cover. The
     * returned paths do not include transient devices, such as USB flash drives
     * connected to handheld devices.
     * <p>
     * An application may store data on any or all of the returned devices. For
     * example, an app may choose to store large files on the device with the
     * most available space, as measured by {@link StatFs}.
     * <p>
     * No additional permissions are required for the calling app to read or
     * write files under the returned path. Write access outside of these paths
     * on secondary external storage devices is not available.
     * <p>
     * The returned paths may change over time if different shared storage media
     * is inserted, so only relative paths should be persisted.
     *
     * @return the absolute paths to application-specific directories. Some
     *         individual paths may be {@code null} if that shared storage is
     *         not currently available. The first path returned is the same as
     *         {@link #getExternalCacheDir()}.
