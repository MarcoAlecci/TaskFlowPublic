     * Converts a String in one of the formats described by
     * FORMAT_DEGREES, FORMAT_MINUTES, or FORMAT_SECONDS into a
     * double. This conversion is performed in a locale agnostic
     * method, and so is not guaranteed to round-trip with
     * {@link #convert(double, int)}.
     *
     * @throws NullPointerException if coordinate is null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the coordinate is not
     * in one of the valid formats.
