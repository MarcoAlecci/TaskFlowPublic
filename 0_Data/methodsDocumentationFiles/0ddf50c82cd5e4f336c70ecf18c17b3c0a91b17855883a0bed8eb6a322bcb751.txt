     * Register a {@link PhoneAccount} for use by the system that will be stored in Device Encrypted
     * storage. When registering {@link PhoneAccount}s, existing registrations will be overwritten
     * if the {@link PhoneAccountHandle} matches that of a {@link PhoneAccount} which is already
     * registered. Once registered, the {@link PhoneAccount} is listed to the user as an option
     * when placing calls. The user may still need to enable the {@link PhoneAccount} within
     * the phone app settings before the account is usable.
     * <p>
     * A {@link SecurityException} will be thrown if an app tries to register a
     * {@link PhoneAccountHandle} where the package name specified within
     * {@link PhoneAccountHandle#getComponentName()} does not match the package name of the app.
