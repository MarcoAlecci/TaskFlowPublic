     * Called when the dream is being asked to stop itself and wake.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation simply calls {@link #finish} which ends the dream
     * immediately.  Subclasses may override this function to perform a smooth exit
     * transition then call {@link #finish} afterwards.
     * </p><p>
     * Note that the dream will only be given a short period of time (currently about
     * five seconds) to wake up.  If the dream does not finish itself in a timely manner
     * then the system will forcibly finish it once the time allowance is up.
