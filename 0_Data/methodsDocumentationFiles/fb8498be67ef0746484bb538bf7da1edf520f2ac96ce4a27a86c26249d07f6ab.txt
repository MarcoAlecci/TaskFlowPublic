      * can be updated out-of-band, its possible a MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) carrier
      * was not fully recognized and assigned to its MNO (Mobile Network Operator) carrier id
      * by default. After carrier id table update, a new carrier id was assigned. If apps don't
      * take the update with the new id, it might be helpful to always fallback by using carrier
      * id based on MCCMNC if there is no match.
