     * Returns a Locale instance describing the language currently being used for synthesis
     * requests sent to the TextToSpeech engine.
     *
     * In Android 4.2 and before (API <= 17) this function returns the language that is currently
     * being used by the TTS engine. That is the last language set by this or any other
     * client by a {@link TextToSpeech#setLanguage} call to the same engine.
     *
     * In Android versions after 4.2 this function returns the language that is currently being
     * used for the synthesis requests sent from this client. That is the last language set
     * by a {@link TextToSpeech#setLanguage} call on this instance.
     *
     * If a voice is set (by {@link #setVoice(Voice)}), getLanguage will return the language of
     * the currently set voice.
     *
     * Please note that the Locale object returned by this method is NOT a valid Locale object. Its
     * language field contains a three-letter ISO 639-2/T code (where a proper Locale would use
     * a two-letter ISO 639-1 code), and the country field contains a three-letter ISO 3166 country
     * code (where a proper Locale would use a two-letter ISO 3166-1 code).
     *
     * @return language, country (if any) and variant (if any) used by the client stored in a
     *     Locale instance, or {@code null} on error.
     *
     * @deprecated As of API level 21, please use <code>getVoice().getLocale()</code>
     * ({@link #getVoice()}).
