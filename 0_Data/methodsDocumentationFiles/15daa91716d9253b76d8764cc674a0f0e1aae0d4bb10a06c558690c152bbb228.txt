     * @return true when this subtype will be enabled by default if no other subtypes in the IME
     * are enabled explicitly, false otherwise. Note that a subtype with this method returning true
     * will not be shown in the list of subtypes in each IME's subtype enabler. Having an
     * "automatic" subtype is an example use of this flag.
