     * Defines the desired weights sum. If unspecified the weights sum is computed
     * at layout time by adding the layout_weight of each child.
     *
     * This can be used for instance to give a single child 50% of the total
     * available space by giving it a layout_weight of 0.5 and setting the
     * weightSum to 1.0.
     *
     * @param weightSum a number greater than 0.0f, or a number lower than or equals
     *        to 0.0f if the weight sum should be computed from the children's
     *        layout_weight
