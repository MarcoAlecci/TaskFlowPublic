     * Mark the area defined by the rect (l,t,r,b) as needing to be drawn. The
     * coordinates of the dirty rect are relative to the view. If the view is
     * visible, {@link #onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)} will be called at some
     * point in the future.
     * <p>
     * This must be called from a UI thread. To call from a non-UI thread, call
     * {@link #postInvalidate()}.
     *
     * @param l the left position of the dirty region
     * @param t the top position of the dirty region
     * @param r the right position of the dirty region
     * @param b the bottom position of the dirty region
     *
     * @deprecated The switch to hardware accelerated rendering in API 14 reduced
     * the importance of the dirty rectangle. In API 21 the given rectangle is
     * ignored entirely in favor of an internally-calculated area instead.
     * Because of this, clients are encouraged to just call {@link #invalidate()}.
