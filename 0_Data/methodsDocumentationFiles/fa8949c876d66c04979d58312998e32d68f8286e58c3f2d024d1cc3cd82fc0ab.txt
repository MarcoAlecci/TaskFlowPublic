     * Called when an {@link #onResume} is coming up, prior to other pre-resume callbacks
     * such as {@link #onNewIntent} and {@link #onActivityResult}.  This is primarily intended
     * to give the activity a hint that its state is no longer saved -- it will generally
     * be called after {@link #onSaveInstanceState} and prior to the activity being
     * resumed/started again.
     *
     * @deprecated starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} onSaveInstanceState is
     * called after {@link #onStop}, so this hint isn't accurate anymore: you should consider your
     * state not saved in between {@code onStart} and {@code onStop} callbacks inclusively.
