     * A provision request/response exchange occurs between the app and a provisioning
     * server to retrieve a device certificate.  If provisionining is required, the
     * EVENT_PROVISION_REQUIRED event will be sent to the event handler.
     * getProvisionRequest is used to obtain the opaque provision request byte array that
     * should be delivered to the provisioning server. The provision request byte array
     * is returned in ProvisionRequest.data. The recommended URL to deliver the provision
     * request to is returned in ProvisionRequest.defaultUrl.
