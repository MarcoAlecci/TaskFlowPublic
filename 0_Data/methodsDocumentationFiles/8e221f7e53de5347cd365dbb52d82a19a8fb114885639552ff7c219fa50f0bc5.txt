         * Put an array of values into buckets. This takes a {@code long[]} and returns {@code
         * int[]} as everywhere this method is used will have to do the conversion anyway, so we
         * save time by doing it here instead
         *
         * @param values the values to bucket
         * @return the bucketed usage times
