     * Clears the stored work source uid.
     *
     * <p>This method should be used when we do not know who to blame. If the UID to blame is the
     * UID of the current process, it is better to attribute the work to the current process
     * explicitly instead of clearing the work source:
     *
     * <pre>
     * ThreadLocalWorkSource.setUid(Process.myUid());
     * </pre>
     *
     * @return a token that can be used to restore the state.
