     * Callback that allows the value of a file-based resources or asset to be specified or
     * overridden.
     *
     * <p>The system will take ownership of the file descriptor returned from this method, so
     * {@link ParcelFileDescriptor#dup() dup} the file descriptor before returning if the system
     * should not own it.
     *
     * <p>There are two situations in which this method will be called:
     * <ul>
     * <li>AssetManager is queried for an InputStream of an asset using APIs like
     * {@link AssetManager#open} and {@link AssetManager#openXmlResourceParser}.
     * <li>AssetManager is resolving the value of a file-based resource provided by the
     * {@link ResourcesProvider} this instance is associated with.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the value retrieved from this callback is null, AssetManager will attempt to find the
     * file-based resource or asset within the APK provided by the ResourcesProvider this instance
     * is associated with.
     *
     * @param path the asset path being loaded
     * @param accessMode the {@link AssetManager} access mode
     *
     * @see AssetManager#open
