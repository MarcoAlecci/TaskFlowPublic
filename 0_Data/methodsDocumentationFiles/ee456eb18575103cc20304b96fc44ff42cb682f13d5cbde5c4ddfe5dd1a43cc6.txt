     * Test if given {@link Signature} sets are effectively equal. In rare
     * cases, certificates can have slightly malformed encoding which causes
     * exact-byte checks to fail.
     * <p>
     * To identify effective equality, we bounce the certificates through an
     * decode/encode pass before doing the exact-byte check. To reduce attack
     * surface area, we only allow a byte size delta of a few bytes.
     *
     * @throws CertificateException if the before/after length differs
     *             substantially, usually a signal of something fishy going on.
