     * Returns whether this Animator has been started and not yet ended. For reusable
     * Animators (which most Animators are, apart from the one-shot animator produced by
     * {@link android.view.ViewAnimationUtils#createCircularReveal(
     * android.view.View, int, int, float, float) createCircularReveal()}),
     * this state is a superset of {@link #isRunning()}, because an Animator with a
     * nonzero {@link #getStartDelay() startDelay} will return true for {@link #isStarted()} during
     * the delay phase, whereas {@link #isRunning()} will return true only after the delay phase
     * is complete. Non-reusable animators will always return true after they have been
     * started, because they cannot return to a non-started state.

     * @return Whether the Animator has been started and not yet ended.
