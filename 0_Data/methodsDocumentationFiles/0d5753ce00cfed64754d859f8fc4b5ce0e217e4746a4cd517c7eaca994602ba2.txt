         * Sets whether encryption using this key must be sufficiently randomized to produce
         * different ciphertexts for the same plaintext every time. The formal cryptographic
         * property being required is <em>indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack
         * ({@code IND-CPA})</em>. This property is important because it mitigates several classes
         * of weaknesses due to which ciphertext may leak information about plaintext. For example,
         * if a given plaintext always produces the same ciphertext, an attacker may see the
         * repeated ciphertexts and be able to deduce something about the plaintext.
         *
         * <p>By default, {@code IND-CPA} is required.
         *
         * <p>When {@code IND-CPA} is required:
         * <ul>
         * <li>transformation which do not offer {@code IND-CPA}, such as symmetric ciphers using
         * {@code ECB} mode or RSA encryption without padding, are prohibited;</li>
         * <li>in transformations which use an IV, such as symmetric ciphers in {@code GCM},
         * {@code CBC}, and {@code CTR} block modes, caller-provided IVs are rejected when
         * encrypting, to ensure that only random IVs are used.</li>
         *
         * <p>Before disabling this requirement, consider the following approaches instead:
         * <ul>
         * <li>If you are generating a random IV for encryption and then initializing a {@code}
         * Cipher using the IV, the solution is to let the {@code Cipher} generate a random IV
         * instead. This will occur if the {@code Cipher} is initialized for encryption without an
         * IV. The IV can then be queried via {@link Cipher#getIV()}.</li>
         * <li>If you are generating a non-random IV (e.g., an IV derived from something not fully
         * random, such as the name of the file being encrypted, or transaction ID, or password,
         * or a device identifier), consider changing your design to use a random IV which will then
         * be provided in addition to the ciphertext to the entities which need to decrypt the
         * ciphertext.</li>
         * <li>If you are using RSA encryption without padding, consider switching to padding
         * schemes which offer {@code IND-CPA}, such as PKCS#1 or OAEP.</li>
         * </ul>
