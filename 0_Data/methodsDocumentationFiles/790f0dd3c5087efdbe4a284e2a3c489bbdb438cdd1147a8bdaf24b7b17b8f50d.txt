     * <p>Query the capabilities of a camera device. These capabilities are
     * immutable for a given camera.</p>
     *
     * <p>From API level 29, this function can also be used to query the capabilities of physical
     * cameras that can only be used as part of logical multi-camera. These cameras cannot be
     * opened directly via {@link #openCamera}</p>
     *
     * <p>Also starting with API level 29, while most basic camera information is still available
     * even without the CAMERA permission, some values are not available to apps that do not hold
     * that permission. The keys not available are listed by
     * {@link CameraCharacteristics#getKeysNeedingPermission}.</p>
     *
     * @param cameraId The id of the camera device to query. This could be either a standalone
     * camera ID which can be directly opened by {@link #openCamera}, or a physical camera ID that
     * can only used as part of a logical multi-camera.
     * @return The properties of the given camera
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the cameraId does not match any
     *         known camera device.
     * @throws CameraAccessException if the camera device has been disconnected.
