     * displayed if you are waiting for the initial data to show in it.  During

     * <p>Applications do not normally need to use this themselves.  The default
     * behavior of ListFragment is to start with the list not being shown, only
     * showing it once an adapter is given with {@link #setListAdapter(ListAdapter)}.
     * If the list at that point had not been shown, when it does get shown
     * it will be do without the user ever seeing the hidden state.
     * 
     * @param shown If true, the list view is shown; if false, the progress
     * indicator.  The initial value is true.
