     * KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyDown()}: perform press of the view
     * when {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER} or {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_ENTER}
     * is released, if the view is enabled and clickable.

     * Key presses in software keyboards will generally NOT trigger this
     * listener, although some may elect to do so in some situations. Do not
     * rely on this to catch software key presses.
