         * By passing true to this method, the build method will compute all possible hyphenation
         * pieces as well.
         *
         * If you don't want to use automatic hyphenation, you can pass false to this method and
         * save the computation time of hyphenation. The default value is false.
         *
         * Even if you pass false to this method, you can still enable automatic hyphenation of
         * LineBreaker but line break computation becomes slower.
         *
         * @param computeHyphenation true if you want to use automatic hyphenations.
