     * Protect a socket from VPN connections. After protecting, data sent
     * through this socket will go directly to the underlying network,
     * so its traffic will not be forwarded through the VPN.
     * This method is useful if some connections need to be kept
     * outside of VPN. For example, a VPN tunnel should protect itself if its
     * destination is covered by VPN routes. Otherwise its outgoing packets
     * will be sent back to the VPN interface and cause an infinite loop. This
     * method will fail if the application is not prepared or is revoked.
     *
     * <p class="note">The socket is NOT closed by this method.
     *
     * @return {@code true} on success.
