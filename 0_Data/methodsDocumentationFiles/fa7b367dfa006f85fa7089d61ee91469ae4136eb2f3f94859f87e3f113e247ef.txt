     * Returns whether the device is being used as an unattended managed kiosk. These requirements
     * are as follows:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>The device is being used as a managed kiosk, as defined at {@link
     *     #isManagedKiosk()}</li>
     *     <li>The device has not received user input for at least 30 minutes</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>See {@link #isManagedKiosk()} for context. This is a stronger requirement that also
     * ensures that the device hasn't been interacted with recently, making it an appropriate check
     * for privacy-sensitive APIs that wouldn't be appropriate during an active user session.
