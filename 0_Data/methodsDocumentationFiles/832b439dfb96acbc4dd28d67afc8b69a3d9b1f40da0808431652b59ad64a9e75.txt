     * Sets the specified output gain value on all channels of this track.
     * <p>Gain values are clamped to the closed interval [0.0, max] where
     * max is the value of {@link #getMaxVolume}.
     * A value of 0.0 results in zero gain (silence), and
     * a value of 1.0 means unity gain (signal unchanged).
     * The default value is 1.0 meaning unity gain.
     * <p>This API is preferred over {@link #setStereoVolume}, as it
     * more gracefully scales down to mono, and up to multi-channel content beyond stereo.
     * <p>The word "volume" in the API name is historical; this is actually a linear gain.
     * @param gain output gain for all channels.
     * @return error code or success, see {@link #SUCCESS},
     *    {@link #ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION}
