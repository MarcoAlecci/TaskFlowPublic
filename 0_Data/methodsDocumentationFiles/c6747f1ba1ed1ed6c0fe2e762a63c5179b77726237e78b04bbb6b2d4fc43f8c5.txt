     * Compares this object against the specified object.
     * The result is {@code true} if and only if the argument is
     * not {@code null} and is a {@code Bitset} object that has
     * exactly the same set of bits set to {@code true} as this bit
     * set. That is, for every nonnegative {@code int} index {@code k},
     * <pre>((BitSet)obj).get(k) == this.get(k)</pre>
     * must be true. The current sizes of the two bit sets are not compared.
     *
     * @param  obj the object to compare with
     * @return {@code true} if the objects are the same;
     *         {@code false} otherwise
