     * Apply this matrix to the array of 2D vectors specified by src, and write the transformed
     * vectors into the array of vectors specified by dst. The two arrays represent their "vectors"
     * as pairs of floats [x, y]. Note: this method does not apply the translation associated with
     * the matrix. Use {@link Matrix#mapPoints(float[], int, float[], int, int)} if you want the
     * translation to be applied.
     *
     * @param dst The array of dst vectors (x,y pairs)
     * @param dstIndex The index of the first [x,y] pair of dst floats
     * @param src The array of src vectors (x,y pairs)
     * @param srcIndex The index of the first [x,y] pair of src floats
     * @param vectorCount The number of vectors (x,y pairs) to transform
