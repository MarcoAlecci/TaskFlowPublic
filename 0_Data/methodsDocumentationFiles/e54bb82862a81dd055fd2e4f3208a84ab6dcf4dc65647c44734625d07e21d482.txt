     * If there is a security manager set, its {@code checkConnect} method is
     * called with the local address and {@code -1} as its arguments to see
     * if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed,
     * the {@link InetAddress#getLoopbackAddress loopback} address is returned.

     * @return the local address to which the socket is bound,
     *         the loopback address if denied by the security manager, or
     *         the wildcard address if the socket is closed or not bound yet.
