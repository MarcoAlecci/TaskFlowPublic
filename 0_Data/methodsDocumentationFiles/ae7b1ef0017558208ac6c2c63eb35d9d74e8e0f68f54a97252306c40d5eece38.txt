     * An app-op may be long running and it has a clear start delimiter.
     * If an op start is attempted by any package, you will get a callback.
     * To change the watched ops for a registered callback you need to unregister and register it
     * again.
     *
     * <p> If you don't hold the {@code android.Manifest.permission#WATCH_APPOPS} permission
     * you can watch changes only for your UID.
     *
     * @param ops The operations to watch.
     * @param callback Where to report changes.
