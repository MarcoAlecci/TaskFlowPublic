     * Returns the best possible localized form of the given skeleton for the given
     * locale. A skeleton is similar to, and uses the same format characters as, a Unicode
     * <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Format_Patterns">UTS #35</a>
     * pattern.
     *
     * <p>One difference is that order is irrelevant. For example, "MMMMd" will return
     * "MMMM d" in the {@code en_US} locale, but "d. MMMM" in the {@code de_CH} locale.
     *
     * <p>Note also in that second example that the necessary punctuation for German was
     * added. For the same input in {@code es_ES}, we'd have even more extra text:
     * "d 'de' MMMM".
     *
     * <p>This method will automatically correct for grammatical necessity. Given the
     * same "MMMMd" input, this method will return "d LLLL" in the {@code fa_IR} locale,
     * where stand-alone months are necessary. Lengths are preserved where meaningful,
     * so "Md" would give a different result to "MMMd", say, except in a locale such as
     * {@code ja_JP} where there is only one length of month.
     *
     * <p>This method will only return patterns that are in CLDR, and is useful whenever
     * you know what elements you want in your format string but don't want to make your
     * code specific to any one locale.
     *
     * @param locale the locale into which the skeleton should be localized
     * @param skeleton a skeleton as described above
     * @return a string pattern suitable for use with {@link java.text.SimpleDateFormat}.
