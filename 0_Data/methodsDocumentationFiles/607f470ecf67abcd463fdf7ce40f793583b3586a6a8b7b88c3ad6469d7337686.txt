     * When set, the selection is verified against malicious arguments. When
     * using this class to create a statement using
     * {@link #buildQueryString(boolean, String, String[], String, String, String, String, String)},
     * non-numeric limits will raise an exception. If a projection map is
     * specified, fields not in that map will be ignored. If this class is used
     * to execute the statement directly using
     * {@link #query(SQLiteDatabase, String[], String, String[], String, String, String)}
     * or
     * {@link #query(SQLiteDatabase, String[], String, String[], String, String, String, String)},
     * additionally also parenthesis escaping selection are caught. To
     * summarize: To get maximum protection against malicious third party apps
     * (for example content provider consumers), make sure to do the following:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Set this value to true</li>
     * <li>Use a projection map</li>
     * <li>Use one of the query overloads instead of getting the statement as a
     * sql string</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This feature is disabled by default on each newly constructed
     * {@link SQLiteQueryBuilder} and needs to be manually enabled.
