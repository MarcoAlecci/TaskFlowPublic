     * Callback invoked when the user mobile data state has changed on the registered subscription.
     * Note, the registration subId comes from {@link TelephonyManager} object which registers
     * PhoneStateListener by {@link TelephonyManager#listen(PhoneStateListener, int)}.
     * If this TelephonyManager object was created with
     * {@link TelephonyManager#createForSubscriptionId(int)}, then the callback applies to the
     * subId. Otherwise, this callback applies to
     * {@link SubscriptionManager#getDefaultSubscriptionId()}.
     *
     * @param enabled indicates whether the current user mobile data state is enabled or disabled.
