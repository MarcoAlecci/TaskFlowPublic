     * Called when the service being bound has returned {@code null} from its
     * {@link android.app.Service#onBind(Intent) onBind()} method.  This indicates
     * that the attempting service binding represented by this ServiceConnection
     * will never become usable.
     *
     * <p class="note">The app which requested the binding must still call
     * {@link Context#unbindService(ServiceConnection)} to release the tracking
     * resources associated with this ServiceConnection even if this callback was
     * invoked following {@link Context#bindService Context.bindService() bindService()}.
     *
     * @param name The concrete component name of the service whose binding
     *     has been rejected by the Service implementation.
