         * the estimated first hop transport bandwidth.
         * <p>
         * Note that when used to request a network, this specifies the minimum acceptable.
         * When received as the state of an existing network this specifies the typical
         * first hop bandwidth expected. This is never measured, but rather is inferred
         * from technology type and other link parameters. It could be used to differentiate
         * between very slow 1xRTT cellular links and other faster networks or even between
         * 802.11b vs 802.11AC wifi technologies. It should not be used to differentiate between
         * fast backhauls and slow backhauls.
