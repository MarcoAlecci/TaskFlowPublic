     * Requests information about the state of a file pending download.
     *
     * The state will be delivered as a callback via
     * {@link DownloadStatusListener#onStatusUpdated(DownloadRequest, FileInfo, int)}. If no such
     * callback has been registered via
     * {@link #addProgressListener(DownloadRequest, Executor, DownloadProgressListener)}, this
     * method will be a no-op.
     *
     * If the middleware has no record of the
     * file indicated by {@code fileInfo} being associated with {@code downloadRequest},
     * an {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown.
     *
     * @param downloadRequest The download request to query.
     * @param fileInfo The particular file within the request to get information on.
