     * Enter a named critical span (e.g. an animation)
     *
     * <p>The name is an arbitary label (or tag) that will be applied to any strictmode violation
     * that happens while this span is active. You must call finish() on the span when done.
     *
     * <p>This will never return null, but on devices without debugging enabled, this may return a
     * dummy object on which the finish() method is a no-op.
     *
     * <p>TODO: add CloseGuard to this, verifying callers call finish.
