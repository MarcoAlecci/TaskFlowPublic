     * Attach a custom Factory interface for creating views while using
     * this LayoutInflater.  This must not be null, and can only be set once;
     * after setting, you can not change the factory.  This is
     * called on each element name as the xml is parsed. If the factory returns
     * a View, that is added to the hierarchy. If it returns null, the next
     * factory default {@link #onCreateView} method is called.
     *
     * <p>If you have an existing
     * LayoutInflater and want to add your own factory to it, use
     * {@link #cloneInContext} to clone the existing instance and then you
     * can use this function (once) on the returned new instance.  This will
     * merge your own factory with whatever factory the original instance is
     * using.
