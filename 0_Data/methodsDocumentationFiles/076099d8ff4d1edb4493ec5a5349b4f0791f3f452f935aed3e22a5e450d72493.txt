         * System will select the font if the text style is closest to the font.
         * If the same style font is already added to the builder, this method will fail with
         * {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
         *
         * Note that system assumes all fonts bundled in FontFamily have the same coverage for the
         * code points. For example, regular style font and bold style font must have the same code
         * point coverage, otherwise some character may be shown as tofu.
