     * Returns the last boundary preceding the specified character offset. If the
     * specified offset equals to the first text boundary, it returns
     * <code>BreakIterator.DONE</code> and the iterator's current position is unchanged.
     * Otherwise, the iterator's current position is set to the returned boundary.
     * The value returned is always less than the offset or the value
     * <code>BreakIterator.DONE</code>.
     * @param offset the character offset to begin scanning.
     * @return The last boundary before the specified offset or
     * <code>BreakIterator.DONE</code> if the first text boundary is passed in
     * as the offset.
     * @exception   IllegalArgumentException if the specified offset is less than
     * the first text boundary or greater than the last text boundary.
     * @since 1.2
