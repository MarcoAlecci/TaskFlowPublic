     * Return an equivalent URI with a lowercase scheme component.
     * This aligns the Uri with Android best practices for
     * intent filtering.
     *
     * <p>For example, "HTTP://www.android.com" becomes
     * "http://www.android.com"
     *
     * <p>All URIs received from outside Android (such as user input,
     * or external sources like Bluetooth, NFC, or the Internet) should
     * be normalized before they are used to create an Intent.
     *
     * <p class="note">This method does <em>not</em> validate bad URI's,
     * or 'fix' poorly formatted URI's - so do not use it for input validation.
     * A Uri will always be returned, even if the Uri is badly formatted to
     * begin with and a scheme component cannot be found.
