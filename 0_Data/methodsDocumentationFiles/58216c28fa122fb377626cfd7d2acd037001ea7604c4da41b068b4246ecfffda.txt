     * When not playing, video elements are represented by a 'poster' image. The
     * image to use can be specified by the poster attribute of the video tag in
     * HTML. If the attribute is absent, then a default poster will be used. This
     * method allows the ChromeClient to provide that default image.
     *
     * @return Bitmap The image to use as a default poster, or {@code null} if no such image is
     * available.
