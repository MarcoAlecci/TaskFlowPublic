     * Gets the inline augmented autofill events that happened after the last
     * {@link #onFillRequest(FillRequest, CancellationSignal, FillController, FillCallback)} call.
     *
     * <p>The history is not persisted over reboots, and it's cleared every time the service
     * replies to a
     * {@link #onFillRequest(FillRequest, CancellationSignal, FillController, FillCallback)}
     * by calling {@link FillCallback#onSuccess(FillResponse)}. Hence, the service should call
     * {@link #getFillEventHistory() before finishing the {@link FillCallback}.
     *
     * <p>Also note that the events from the dropdown suggestion UI is not stored in the history
     * since the service owns the UI.
     *
     * @return The history or {@code null} if there are no events.
