     * Default implementation of
     * {@link android.view.Window.Callback#onPanelClosed(int, Menu)} for
     * activities. This calls through to {@link #onOptionsMenuClosed(Menu)}
     * method for the {@link android.view.Window#FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL} panel,
     * so that subclasses of Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.
     * For context menus ({@link Window#FEATURE_CONTEXT_MENU}), the
     * {@link #onContextMenuClosed(Menu)} will be called.
