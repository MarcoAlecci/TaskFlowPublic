         * Flags a view so that it will not be scrapped or recycled.
         * <p>
         * Scope of ignoring a child is strictly restricted to position tracking, scrapping and
         * recyling. Methods like {@link #removeAndRecycleAllViews(Recycler)} will ignore the child
         * whereas {@link #removeAllViews()} or {@link #offsetChildrenHorizontal(int)} will not
         * ignore the child.
         * <p>
         * Before this child can be recycled again, you have to call
         * {@link #stopIgnoringView(View)}.
         * <p>
         * You can call this method only if your LayoutManger is in onLayout or onScroll callback.
         *
         * @param view View to ignore.
         * @see #stopIgnoringView(View)
