     * Register an observer class that gets callbacks when data identified by a
     * given content URI changes.
     * <p>
     * Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O}, all content
     * notifications must be backed by a valid {@link ContentProvider}.
     *
     * @param uri The URI to watch for changes. This can be a specific row URI,
     *            or a base URI for a whole class of content.
     * @param notifyForDescendants When false, the observer will be notified
     *            whenever a change occurs to the exact URI specified by
     *            <code>uri</code> or to one of the URI's ancestors in the path
     *            hierarchy. When true, the observer will also be notified
     *            whenever a change occurs to the URI's descendants in the path
     *            hierarchy.
     * @param observer The object that receives callbacks when changes occur.
