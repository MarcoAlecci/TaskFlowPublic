     * Return a new audio session identifier not associated with any player or effect.
     * An audio session identifier is a system wide unique identifier for a set of audio streams
     * (one or more mixed together).
     * <p>The primary use of the audio session ID is to associate audio effects to audio players,
     * such as {@link MediaPlayer} or {@link AudioTrack}: all audio effects sharing the same audio
     * session ID will be applied to the mixed audio content of the players that share the same
     * audio session.
     * <p>This method can for instance be used when creating one of the
     * {@link android.media.audiofx.AudioEffect} objects to define the audio session of the effect,
     * or to specify a session for a speech synthesis utterance
     * in {@link android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech.Engine}.
     * @return a new unclaimed and unused audio session identifier, or {@link #ERROR} when the
     *   system failed to generate a new session, a condition in which audio playback or recording
     *   will subsequently fail as well.
