     * This function should be called from checkAndProcessPlusCode only
     * And it is used for test purpose also.
     *
     * It checks the dial string by looping through the network portion,
     * post dial portion 1, post dial porting 2, etc. If there is any
     * plus sign, then process the plus sign.
     * Currently, this function supports the plus sign conversion within NANP only.
     * Specifically, it handles the plus sign in the following ways:
     * 1)+1NANP,remove +, e.g.
     *   +18475797000 is converted to 18475797000,
     * 2)+NANP or +non-NANP Numbers,replace + with the current NANP IDP, e.g,
     *   +8475797000 is converted to 0118475797000,
     *   +11875767800 is converted to 01111875767800
     * 3)+1NANP in post dial string(s), e.g.
     *   8475797000;+18475231753 is converted to 8475797000;18475231753

     * @param dialStr the original dial string
     * @param currFormat the numbering system of the current country that the phone is camped on
     * @param defaultFormat the numbering system of the country that the phone is activated on
     * @return the converted dial string if the current/default countries belong to NANP,
     * and if there is the "+" in the original dial string. Otherwise, the original dial
     * string returns.
