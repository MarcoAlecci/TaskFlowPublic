     * Register the provided callback handler for SoftAp events. The interface must first be created
     * using {@link #setupInterfaceForSoftApMode(String)}. The callback registration is valid until
     * the interface is deleted using {@link #tearDownSoftApInterface(String)} (no deregistration
     * method is provided).
     * <p>
     * Note that only one callback can be registered at a time - any registration overrides previous
     * registrations.
     *
     * @param ifaceName Name of the interface on which to register the callback.
     * @param executor The Executor on which to execute the callbacks.
     * @param callback Callback for AP events.
     * @return true on success, false on failure (e.g. when called on an interface which has not
     * been set up).
