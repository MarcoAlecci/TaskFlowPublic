     * Expected AOSP format is available in the sample files under {@code /frameworks/base/wifi/

     * Note:
     * <li>OEMs need to change the implementation of
     * {@link #convertAndRetrieveSharedConfigStoreFile(int)} only if their existing config store
     * format or file locations differs from the vanilla AOSP implementation.</li>
     * <li>The wifi apex will invoke
     * {@link #convertAndRetrieveSharedConfigStoreFile(int)}
     * method on every bootup, it is the responsibility of the OEM implementation to ensure that
     * they perform the necessary in place conversion of their config store file to conform to the
     * AOSP format. The OEM should ensure that the method should only return the
     * {@link InputStream} stream for the data to be migrated only on the first bootup.</li>
     * <li>Once the migration is done, the apex will invoke
     * {@link #removeSharedConfigStoreFile(int)} to delete the store file.</li>
     * <li>The only relevant invocation of {@link #convertAndRetrieveSharedConfigStoreFile(int)}
     * occurs when a previously released device upgrades to the wifi apex from an OEM
     * implementation of the wifi stack.
     * <li>Ensure that the legacy file paths are accessible to the wifi module (sepolicy rules, file
     * permissions, etc). Since the wifi service continues to run inside system_server process, this
     * method will be called from the same context (so ideally the file should still be accessible).
