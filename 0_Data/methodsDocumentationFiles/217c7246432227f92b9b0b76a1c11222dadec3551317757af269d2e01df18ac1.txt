     * Method where the instrumentation thread enters execution.  This allows
     * you to run your instrumentation code in a separate thread than the
     * application, so that it can perform blocking operation such as
     * {@link #sendKeySync} or {@link #startActivitySync}.
     * 
     * <p>You will typically want to call finish() when this function is done,
     * to end your instrumentation.
