     * Converts the input data (content) that is part of a rights-protected file. The converted
     * data and status is returned in a {@link DrmConvertedStatus} object. This method should be
     * called each time there is a new block of data received by the application.
     *
     * @param convertId Handle for the conversion session.
     * @param inputData Input data that needs to be converted.
     *
     * @return A {@link DrmConvertedStatus} object that contains the status of the data conversion,
     * the converted data, and offset for the header and body signature. An application can 
     * ignore the offset because it is only relevant to the
     * {@link #closeConvertSession closeConvertSession()} method.
