     * Returns structured sort args formatted as an SQL sort clause.
     *
     * NOTE: Collator clauses are suitable for use with non text fields. We might
     * choose to omit any collation clause since we don't know the underlying
     * type of data to be collated. Imperical testing shows that sqlite3 doesn't
     * appear to care much about the presence of collate clauses in queries
     * when ordering by numeric fields. For this reason we include collate
     * clause unilaterally when {@link #QUERY_ARG_SORT_COLLATION} is present
     * in query args bundle.
     *
     * TODO: Would be nice to explicitly validate that colums referenced in
     * {@link #QUERY_ARG_SORT_COLUMNS} are present in the associated projection.
