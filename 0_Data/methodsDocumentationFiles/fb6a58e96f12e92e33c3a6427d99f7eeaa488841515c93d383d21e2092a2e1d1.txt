         * Merges the signing lineage of this instance with the lineage in the provided {@code
         * otherSigningDetails} when one has the same or an ancestor signer of the other.
         *
         * <p>Merging two signing lineages will result in a new {@code SigningDetails} instance
         * containing the longest common lineage with the most restrictive capabilities. If the two
         * lineages contain the same signers with the same capabilities then the instance on which
         * this was invoked is returned without any changes. Similarly if neither instance has a
         * lineage, or if neither has the same or an ancestor signer then this instance is returned.
         *
         * Following are some example results of this method for lineages with signers A, B, C, D:
         * - lineage B merged with lineage A -> B returns lineage A -> B.
         * - lineage A -> B merged with lineage B -> C returns lineage A -> B -> C
         * - lineage A -> B with the {@code PERMISSION} capability revoked for A merged with
         *  lineage A -> B with the {@code SHARED_USER_ID} capability revoked for A returns
         *  lineage A -> B with both capabilities revoked for A.
         * - lineage A -> B -> C merged with lineage A -> B -> D would return the original lineage
         *  A -> B -> C since the current signer of both instances is not the same or in the
         *   lineage of the other.
