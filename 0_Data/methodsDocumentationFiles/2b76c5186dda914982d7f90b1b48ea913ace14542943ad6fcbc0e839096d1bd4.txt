     * Returns the initialization vector (IV) in a new buffer.
     *
     * <p>This is useful in the case where a random IV was created,
     * or in the context of password-based encryption or
     * decryption, where the IV is derived from a user-supplied password.
     *
     * @return the initialization vector in a new buffer, or null if the
     * underlying algorithm does not use an IV, or if the IV has not yet
     * been set.
