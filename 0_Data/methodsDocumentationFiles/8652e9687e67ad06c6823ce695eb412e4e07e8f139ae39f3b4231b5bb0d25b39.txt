     * Gets the time when the current frame started.
     * <p>
     * This method provides the time in milliseconds when the frame started being rendered.
     * The frame time provides a stable time base for synchronizing animations
     * and drawing.  It should be used instead of {@link SystemClock#uptimeMillis()}
     * or {@link System#nanoTime()} for animations and drawing in the UI.  Using the frame
     * time helps to reduce inter-frame jitter because the frame time is fixed at the time
     * the frame was scheduled to start, regardless of when the animations or drawing
     * callback actually runs.  All callbacks that run as part of rendering a frame will
     * observe the same frame time so using the frame time also helps to synchronize effects
     * that are performed by different callbacks.
     * </p><p>
     * Please note that the framework already takes care to process animations and
     * drawing using the frame time as a stable time base.  Most applications should
     * not need to use the frame time information directly.
     * </p><p>
     * This method should only be called from within a callback.
