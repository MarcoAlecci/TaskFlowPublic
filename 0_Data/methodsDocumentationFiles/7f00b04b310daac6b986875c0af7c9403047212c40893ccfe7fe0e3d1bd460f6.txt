     * <p>Enables Z support which defaults to disabled. This allows for RenderNodes drawn with
     * {@link #drawRenderNode(RenderNode)} to be re-arranged based off of their
     * {@link RenderNode#getElevation()} and {@link RenderNode#getTranslationZ()}
     * values. It also enables rendering of shadows for RenderNodes with an elevation or
     * translationZ.</p>
     *
     * <p>Any draw reordering will not be moved before this call. A typical usage of this might
     * look something like:
     *
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     *     void draw(Canvas canvas) {
     *         // Draw any background content
     *         canvas.drawColor(backgroundColor);
     *
     *         // Begin drawing that may be reordered based off of Z
     *         canvas.enableZ();
     *         for (RenderNode child : children) {
     *             canvas.drawRenderNode(child);
     *         }
     *         // End drawing that may be reordered based off of Z
     *         canvas.disableZ();
     *
     *         // Draw any overlays
     *         canvas.drawText("I'm on top of everything!", 0, 0, paint);
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * </p>
     *
     * Note: This is not impacted by any {@link #save()} or {@link #restore()} calls as it is not
     * considered to be part of the current matrix or clip.
     *
     * See {@link #disableZ()}
