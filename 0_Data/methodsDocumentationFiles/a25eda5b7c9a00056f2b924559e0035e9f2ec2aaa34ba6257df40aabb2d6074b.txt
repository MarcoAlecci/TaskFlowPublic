     * Register a callback to be invoked when session state has been
     * lost. This event can occur on devices that are not capable of
     * retaining crypto session state across device suspend/resume
     * cycles.  When this event occurs, the session must be closed and
     * a new session opened to resume operation.
     *
     * @param listener the callback that will be run, or {@code null} to unregister the
     *     previously registered callback.
     * @param handler the handler on which the listener should be invoked, or
     *     {@code null} if the listener should be invoked on the calling thread's looper.
