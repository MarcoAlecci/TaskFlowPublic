     * Request to hide the soft input window from the context of the window
     * that is currently accepting input.  This should be called as a result
     * of the user doing some actually than fairly explicitly requests to
     * have the input window hidden.
     *
     * <p><strong>Caveat:</strong> {@link ResultReceiver} instance passed to
     * this method can be a long-lived object, because it may not be
     * garbage-collected until all the corresponding {@link ResultReceiver}
     * objects transferred to different processes get garbage-collected.
     * Follow the general patterns to avoid memory leaks in Android.
     * Consider to use {@link java.lang.ref.WeakReference} so that application
     * logic objects such as {@link android.app.Activity} and {@link Context}
     * can be garbage collected regardless of the lifetime of
     * {@link ResultReceiver}.
     *
     * @param windowToken The token of the window that is making the request,
     * as returned by {@link View#getWindowToken() View.getWindowToken()}.
     * @param flags Provides additional operating flags.  Currently may be
     * 0 or have the {@link #HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY} bit set.
     * @param resultReceiver If non-null, this will be called by the IME when
     * it has processed your request to tell you what it has done.  The result
     * code you receive may be either {@link #RESULT_UNCHANGED_SHOWN},
     * {@link #RESULT_UNCHANGED_HIDDEN}, {@link #RESULT_SHOWN}, or
     * {@link #RESULT_HIDDEN}.
