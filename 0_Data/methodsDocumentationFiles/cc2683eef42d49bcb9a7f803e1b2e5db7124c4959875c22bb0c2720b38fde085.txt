         * Queries the lower inset bound of the animation. If the animation is about showing or
         * hiding a window that cause insets, the lower bound is {@link Insets#NONE} and the upper
         * bound is the same as {@link WindowInsets#getInsets(int)} for the fully shown state. This
         * is the same as {@link WindowInsetsAnimationController#getHiddenStateInsets} and
         * {@link WindowInsetsAnimationController#getShownStateInsets} in case the listener gets
         * invoked because of an animation that originates from
         * {@link WindowInsetsAnimationController}.
         * <p>
         * However, if the size of a window that causes insets is changing, these are the
         * lower/upper bounds of that size animation.
         * </p>
         * There are no overlapping animations for a specific type, but there may be multiple
         * animations running at the same time for different inset types.
