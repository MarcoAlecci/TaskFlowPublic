     * Called when an attached input method calls
     * {@link InputConnection#performEditorAction(int)
     * InputConnection.performEditorAction()}
     * for this text view.  The default implementation will call your action
     * listener supplied to {@link #setOnEditorActionListener}, or perform
     * a standard operation for {@link EditorInfo#IME_ACTION_NEXT
     * EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_NEXT}, {@link EditorInfo#IME_ACTION_PREVIOUS
     * EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_PREVIOUS}, or {@link EditorInfo#IME_ACTION_DONE
     * EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_DONE}.
     *
     * <p>For backwards compatibility, if no IME options have been set and the
     * text view would not normally advance focus on enter, then
     * the NEXT and DONE actions received here will be turned into an enter
     * key down/up pair to go through the normal key handling.
     *
     * @param actionCode The code of the action being performed.
