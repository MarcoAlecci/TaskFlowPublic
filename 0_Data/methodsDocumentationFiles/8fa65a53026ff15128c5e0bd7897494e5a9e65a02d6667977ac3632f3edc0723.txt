     * Sets a {@link MediaController} to send media keys and volume changes to.
     * <p>
     * The controller will be tied to the window of this Activity. Media key and
     * volume events which are received while the Activity is in the foreground
     * will be forwarded to the controller and used to invoke transport controls
     * or adjust the volume. This may be used instead of or in addition to
     * {@link #setVolumeControlStream} to affect a specific session instead of a
     * specific stream.
     * <p>
     * It is not guaranteed that the hardware volume controls will always change
     * this session's volume (for example, if a call is in progress, its
     * stream's volume may be changed instead). To reset back to the default use
     * null as the controller.
     *
     * @param controller The controller for the session which should receive
     *            media keys and volume changes.
