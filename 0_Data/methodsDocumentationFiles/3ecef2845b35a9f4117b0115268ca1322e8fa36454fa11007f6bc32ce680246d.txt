     * Return an XmlResourceParser through which you can read an animation
     * description for the given resource ID.  This parser has limited
     * functionality -- in particular, you can't change its input, and only
     * the high-level events are available.
     * 
     * <p>This function is really a simple wrapper for calling
     * {@link #getXml} with an animation resource.
     * 
     * @param id The desired resource identifier, as generated by the aapt
     *           tool. This integer encodes the package, type, and resource
     *           entry. The value 0 is an invalid identifier.
     *
     * @throws NotFoundException Throws NotFoundException if the given ID does not exist.
     * 
     * @return A new parser object through which you can read
     *         the XML data.
     *         
     * @see #getXml
