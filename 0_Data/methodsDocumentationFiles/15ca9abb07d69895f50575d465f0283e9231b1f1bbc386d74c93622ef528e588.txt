     * When {@link CameraMetadata#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_CONSTRAINED_HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO} is
     * supported in {@link CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES}, this method will
     * list the supported high speed video size configurations. All the sizes listed will be a
     * subset of the sizes reported by {@link #getOutputSizes} for processed non-stalling formats
     * (typically {@link ImageFormat#PRIVATE} {@link ImageFormat#YUV_420_888}, etc.)

     * To enable high speed video recording, application must create a constrained create high speed
     * capture session via {@link CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession}, and submit
     * a CaptureRequest list created by
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession#createHighSpeedRequestList}
     * to this session. The application must select the video size from this method and
     * {@link CaptureRequest#CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE FPS range} from
     * {@link #getHighSpeedVideoFpsRangesFor} to configure the constrained high speed session and
     * generate the high speed request list. For example, if the application intends to do high
     * speed recording, it can select the maximum size reported by this method to create high speed
     * capture session. Note that for the use case of multiple output streams, application must
     * select one unique size from this method to use (e.g., preview and recording streams must have
     * the same size). Otherwise, the high speed session creation will fail. Once the size is
     * selected, application can get the supported FPS ranges by
     * {@link #getHighSpeedVideoFpsRangesFor}, and use these FPS ranges to setup the recording
     * request lists via
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession#createHighSpeedRequestList}.
