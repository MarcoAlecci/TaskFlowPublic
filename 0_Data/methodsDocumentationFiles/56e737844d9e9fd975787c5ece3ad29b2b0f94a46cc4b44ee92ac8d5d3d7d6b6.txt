     * Returns the comparison result of the next row from each cursor. If one cursor
     * has no more rows but the other does then subsequent calls to this will indicate that
     * the remaining rows are unique.
     * <p>
     * The caller must check that hasNext() returns true before calling this.
     * <p>
     * Once next() has been called the cursors specified in the result of the call to
     * next() are guaranteed to point to the row that was indicated. Reading values
     * from the cursor that was not indicated in the call to next() will result in
     * undefined behavior.
     * @return LEFT, if the row pointed to by the left cursor is unique, RIGHT
     *   if the row pointed to by the right cursor is unique, BOTH if the rows in both
     *   cursors are the same.
