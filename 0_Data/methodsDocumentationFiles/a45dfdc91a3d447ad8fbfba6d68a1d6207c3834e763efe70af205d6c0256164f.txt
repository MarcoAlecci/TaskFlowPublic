         * Sets the source bounds hint. These bounds are only used when an activity first enters
         * picture-in-picture, and describe the bounds in window coordinates of activity entering
         * picture-in-picture that will be visible following the transition. For the best effect,
         * these bounds should also match the aspect ratio in the arguments.
         *
         * @param launchBounds window-coordinate bounds indicating the area of the activity that
         * will still be visible following the transition into picture-in-picture (eg. the video
         * view bounds in a video player)
