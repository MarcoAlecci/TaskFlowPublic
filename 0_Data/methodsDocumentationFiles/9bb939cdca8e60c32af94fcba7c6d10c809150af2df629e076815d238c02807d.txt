     * Return a {@link android.content.res.ConstantState} instance that holds the shared state of
     * this Animator.
     * <p>
     * This constant state is used to create new instances of this animator when needed, instead
     * of re-loading it from resources. Default implementation creates a new
     * {@link AnimatorConstantState}. You can override this method to provide your custom logic or
     * return null if you don't want this animator to be cached.

     * @return The ConfigurationBoundResourceCache.BaseConstantState associated to this Animator.
