     * Method for enabling or disabling a single location provider. This method is deprecated and
     * functions as a best effort. It should not be relied on in any meaningful sense as providers
     * may no longer be enabled or disabled by clients.
     *
     * @param provider a provider listed by {@link #getAllProviders()}
     * @param enabled whether to enable or disable the provider
     * @param userHandle the user to set
     * @return true if the value was set, false otherwise
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if provider is null
     * @deprecated Do not manipulate providers individually, use
     * {@link #setLocationEnabledForUser(boolean, UserHandle)} instead.
     * @hide
