     * get information about the nano app instance
     *
     * NOTE: The returned NanoAppInstanceInfo does _not_ contain correct
     * information for several fields, specifically:
     * - getName()
     * - getPublisher()
     * - getNeededExecMemBytes()
     * - getNeededReadMemBytes()
     * - getNeededWriteMemBytes()
     *
     * For example, say you call loadNanoApp() with a NanoApp that has
     * getName() returning "My Name".  Later, if you call getNanoAppInstanceInfo
     * for that nanoapp, the returned NanoAppInstanceInfo's getName()
     * method will claim "Preloaded app, unknown", even though you would
     * have expected "My Name".  For now, as the user, you'll need to
     * separately track the above fields if they are of interest to you.
     *
     * TODO(b/30943489): Have the returned NanoAppInstanceInfo contain the
     *     correct information.
     *
     * @param nanoAppHandle handle of the nanoapp instance
     * @return NanoAppInstanceInfo the NanoAppInstanceInfo of the nanoapp, or null if the nanoapp
     *                             does not exist
     *
     * @see NanoAppInstanceInfo
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #queryNanoApps(ContextHubInfo)} instead to explicitly query the hub
     *             for loaded nanoapps.
