     * Returns a {@link FrameRenderRequest} that can be used to render a new frame. This is used
     * to synchronize the RenderNode content provided by {@link #setContentRoot(RenderNode)} with
     * the RenderThread and then renders a single frame to the Surface set with
     * {@link #setSurface(Surface)}.
     *
     * @return An instance of {@link FrameRenderRequest}. The instance may be reused for every
     * frame, so the caller should not hold onto it for longer than a single render request.
