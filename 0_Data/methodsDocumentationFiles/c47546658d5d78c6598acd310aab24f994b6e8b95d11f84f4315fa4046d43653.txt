     * Handle a call to {@link #shellCommand}.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation performs a caller check to make sure the caller UID is of
     * SHELL or ROOT, and then call {@link #handleShellCommand}.
     *
     * <p class="caution">Note: no permission checking is done before calling this method; you must
     * apply any security checks as appropriate for the command being executed.
     * Consider using {@link ShellCommand} to help in the implementation.</p>
