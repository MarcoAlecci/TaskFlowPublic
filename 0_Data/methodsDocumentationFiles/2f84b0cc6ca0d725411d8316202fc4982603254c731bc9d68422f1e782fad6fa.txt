     * Returns carrier id name of the current subscription.
     * <p>Carrier id name is a user-facing name of carrier id returned by
     * {@link #getSimCarrierId()}, usually the brand name of the subsidiary
     * (e.g. T-Mobile). Each carrier could configure multiple {@link #getSimOperatorName() SPN} but
     * should have a single carrier name. Carrier name is not a canonical identity,
     * use {@link #getSimCarrierId()} instead.
     * <p>The returned carrier name is unlocalized.
     *
     * @return Carrier name of the current subscription. Return {@code null} if the subscription is
     * unavailable or the carrier cannot be identified.
