     * Like {@link #noteOp(String, int, String, String, String)} but instead of throwing a
     * {@link SecurityException} it returns {@link #MODE_ERRORED}.
     *
     * @param op The operation to note.  One of the OPSTR_* constants.
     * @param uid The user id of the application attempting to perform the operation.
     * @param packageName The name of the application attempting to perform the operation.
     * @param attributionTag The {@link Context#createAttributionContext attribution tag} or {@code
     * null} for default attribution
     * @param message A message describing the reason the op was noted
     *
     * @return Returns {@link #MODE_ALLOWED} if the operation is allowed, or
     * {@link #MODE_IGNORED} if it is not allowed and should be silently ignored (without
     * causing the app to crash).
