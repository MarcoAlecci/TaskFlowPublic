         * Sets whether this key is authorized to be used only for messages confirmed by the
         * user.
         *
         * Confirmation is separate from user authentication (see
         * {@link #setUserAuthenticationRequired(boolean)}). Keys can be created that require
         * confirmation but not user authentication, or user authentication but not confirmation,
         * or both. Confirmation verifies that some user with physical possession of the device has
         * approved a displayed message. User authentication verifies that the correct user is
         * present and has authenticated.
         *
         * <p>This authorization applies only to secret key and private key operations. Public key
         * operations are not restricted.
         *
         * See {@link android.security.ConfirmationPrompt} class for
         * more details about user confirmations.
