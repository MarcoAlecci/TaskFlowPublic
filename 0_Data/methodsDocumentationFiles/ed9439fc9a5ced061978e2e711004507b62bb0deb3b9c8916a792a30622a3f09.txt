     * Returns the overlay for this view, creating it if it does not yet exist.
     * Adding drawables to the overlay will cause them to be displayed whenever
     * the view itself is redrawn. Objects in the overlay should be actively
     * managed: remove them when they should not be displayed anymore. The
     * overlay will always have the same size as its host view.
     *
     * <p>Note: Overlays do not currently work correctly with {@link
     * SurfaceView} or {@link TextureView}; contents in overlays for these
     * types of views may not display correctly.</p>
