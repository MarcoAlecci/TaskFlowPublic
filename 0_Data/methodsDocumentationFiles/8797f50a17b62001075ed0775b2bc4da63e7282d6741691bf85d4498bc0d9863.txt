     * An inspection API to retrieve the list of available
     * {@link android.telephony.mbms.FileServiceInfo}s currently being advertised.
     * The results are returned asynchronously via a call to
     * {@link MbmsDownloadSessionCallback#onFileServicesUpdated(List)}
     *
     * Asynchronous error codes via the {@link MbmsDownloadSessionCallback#onError(int, String)}
     * callback may include any of the errors that are not specific to the streaming use-case.
     *
     * May throw an {@link IllegalStateException} or {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
     *
     * @param classList A list of service classes which the app wishes to receive
     *                  {@link MbmsDownloadSessionCallback#onFileServicesUpdated(List)} callbacks
     *                  about. Subsequent calls to this method will replace this list of service
     *                  classes (i.e. the middleware will no longer send updates for services
     *                  matching classes only in the old list).
     *                  Values in this list should be negotiated with the wireless carrier prior
     *                  to using this API.
