     * Convenience method to create a MediaPlayer for a given Uri.
     * On success, {@link #prepare()} will already have been called and must not be called again.
     * <p>When done with the MediaPlayer, you should call  {@link #release()},
     * to free the resources. If not released, too many MediaPlayer instances will
     * result in an exception.</p>
     * <p>Note that since {@link #prepare()} is called automatically in this method,
     * you cannot change the audio
     * session ID (see {@link #setAudioSessionId(int)}) or audio attributes
     * (see {@link #setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)} of the new MediaPlayer.</p>
     *
     * @param context the Context to use
     * @param uri the Uri from which to get the datasource
     * @return a MediaPlayer object, or null if creation failed
