     * <p>The range is {@value #SCORE_MIN} to {@value #SCORE_MAX}.
     * {@value #SCORE_MAX} is the highest confidence.</p>
     *
     * <p>Depending on the device, even very low-confidence faces may be
     * listed, so applications should filter out faces with low confidence,
     * depending on the use case. For a typical point-and-shoot camera
     * application that wishes to display rectangles around detected faces,
     * filtering out faces with confidence less than half of {@value #SCORE_MAX}
     * is recommended.</p>
