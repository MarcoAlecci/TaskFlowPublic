     * Add a new Intent data authority to match against.  The filter must
     * include one or more schemes (via {@link #addDataScheme}) for the
     * authority to be considered.  If any authorities are
     * included in the filter, then an Intent's data must match one of
     * them.  If no authorities are included, then only the scheme must match.
     *
     * <p><em>Note: host name in the Android framework is
     * case-sensitive, unlike formal RFC host names.  As a result,
     * you should always write your host names with lower case letters,
     * and any host names you receive from outside of Android should be
     * converted to lower case before supplying them here.</em></p>
     *
     * @param host The host part of the authority to match.  May start with a
     *             single '*' to wildcard the front of the host name.
     * @param port Optional port part of the authority to match.  If null, any
     *             port is allowed.
