     * Gets count of hardware clock discontinuities.
     *
     * <p>When this value stays the same, vs. a value in a previously reported {@link GnssClock}, it
     * can be safely assumed that the {@code TimeNanos} value has been derived from a clock that has
     * been running continuously - e.g. a single continuously powered crystal oscillator, and thus
     * the {@code (FullBiasNanos + BiasNanos)} offset can be modelled with traditional clock bias
     * &amp; drift models.
     *
     * <p>Each time this value changes, vs. the value in a previously reported {@link GnssClock},
     * that suggests the hardware clock may have experienced a discontinuity (e.g. a power cycle or
     * other anomaly), so that any assumptions about modelling a smoothly changing
     * {@code (FullBiasNanos + BiasNanos)} offset, and a smoothly growing {@code (TimeNanos)}
     * between this and the previously reported {@code GnssClock}, should be reset.
