     * The system calls this method during the outgoing call flow if it needs account suggestions.
     *
     * The implementer of this service must override this method to implement its account suggestion
     * logic. After preparing the suggestions, the implementation of the service must call
     * {@link #suggestPhoneAccounts(String, List)} to deliver the suggestions back to the system.
     *
     * Note that the system will suspend the outgoing call process after it calls this method until
     * this service calls {@link #suggestPhoneAccounts}.
     *
     * @param number The phone number to provide suggestions for.
