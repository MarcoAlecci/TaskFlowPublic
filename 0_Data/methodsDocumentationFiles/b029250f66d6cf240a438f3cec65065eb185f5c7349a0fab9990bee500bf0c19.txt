     * Called when a touch screen event was not handled by any of the views
     * under it. This is most useful to process touch events that happen outside
     * of your window bounds, where there is no view to receive it.
     * 
     * @param event The touch screen event being processed.
     * @return Return true if you have consumed the event, false if you haven't.
     *         The default implementation will cancel the dialog when a touch
     *         happens outside of the window bounds.
