     * Acquire the next Image from the ImageReader's queue. Returns {@code null} if
     * no new image is available.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p><i>Warning:</i> Consider using {@link #acquireLatestImage()} instead, as it will
     * automatically release older images, and allow slower-running processing routines to catch
     * up to the newest frame. Usage of {@link #acquireNextImage} is recommended for
     * batch/background processing. Incorrectly using this function can cause images to appear
     * with an ever-increasing delay, followed by a complete stall where no new images seem to
     * appear.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * This operation will fail by throwing an {@link IllegalStateException} if
     * {@code maxImages} have been acquired with {@link #acquireNextImage} or
     * {@link #acquireLatestImage}. In particular a sequence of {@link #acquireNextImage} or
     * {@link #acquireLatestImage} calls greater than {@link #getMaxImages maxImages} without
     * calling {@link Image#close} in-between will exhaust the underlying queue. At such a time,
     * {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown until more images are released with
     * {@link Image#close}.
