         * Set a linear block to this queue request. Exactly one buffer must be
         * set for a queue request before calling {@link #queue}. It is possible
         * to use the same {@link LinearBlock} object for multiple queue
         * requests. The behavior is undefined if the range of the buffer
         * overlaps for multiple requests, or the application writes into the
         * region being processed by the codec.
         *
         * @param block The linear block object
         * @param offset The byte offset into the input buffer at which the data starts.
         * @param size The number of bytes of valid input data.
         * @return this object
         * @throws IllegalStateException if a buffer is already set
