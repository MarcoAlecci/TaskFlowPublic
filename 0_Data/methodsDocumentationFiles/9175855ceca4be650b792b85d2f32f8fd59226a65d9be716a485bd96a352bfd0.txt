     * Limit the NFC controller to reader mode while this Activity is in the foreground.
     *
     * <p>In this mode the NFC controller will only act as an NFC tag reader/writer,
     * thus disabling any peer-to-peer (Android Beam) and card-emulation modes of
     * the NFC adapter on this device.
     *
     * <p>Use {@link #FLAG_READER_SKIP_NDEF_CHECK} to prevent the platform from
     * performing any NDEF checks in reader mode. Note that this will prevent the
     * {@link Ndef} tag technology from being enumerated on the tag, and that
     * NDEF-based tag dispatch will not be functional.
     *
     * <p>For interacting with tags that are emulated on another Android device
     * using Android's host-based card-emulation, the recommended flags are
     * {@link #FLAG_READER_NFC_A} and {@link #FLAG_READER_SKIP_NDEF_CHECK}.
     *
     * @param activity the Activity that requests the adapter to be in reader mode
     * @param callback the callback to be called when a tag is discovered
     * @param flags Flags indicating poll technologies and other optional parameters
     * @param extras Additional extras for configuring reader mode.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if FEATURE_NFC is unavailable.
