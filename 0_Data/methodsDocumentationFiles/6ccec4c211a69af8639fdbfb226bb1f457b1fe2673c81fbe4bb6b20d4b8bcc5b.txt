     * <p>
     * The timestamp is measured in nanoseconds, and is normally monotonically
     * increasing. The timestamps for the images from different sources may have
     * different timebases therefore may not be comparable. The specific meaning and
     * timebase of the timestamp depend on the source providing images. See
     * {@link android.hardware.Camera Camera},
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice CameraDevice},
     * {@link MediaPlayer} and {@link MediaCodec} for more details.
