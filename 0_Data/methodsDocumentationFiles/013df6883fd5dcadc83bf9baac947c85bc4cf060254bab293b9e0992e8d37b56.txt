     * Returns a list of items resulting from applying the given function to each element of the
     * provided list.
     *
     * The resulting list will have the same {@link #size} as the input one.
     *
     * This is similar to {@link Stream#map} but without the overhead of creating an intermediate
     * {@link Stream} instance
