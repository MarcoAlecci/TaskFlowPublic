     * This method tells the ViewGroup that the given View object, which should have this
     * ViewGroup as its parent,
     * should be kept around  (re-displayed when the ViewGroup draws its children) even if it
     * is removed from its parent. This allows animations, such as those used by
     * {@link android.app.Fragment} and {@link android.animation.LayoutTransition} to animate
     * the removal of views. A call to this method should always be accompanied by a later call
     * to {@link #endViewTransition(View)}, such as after an animation on the View has finished,
     * so that the View finally gets removed.
     *
     * @param view The View object to be kept visible even if it gets removed from its parent.
