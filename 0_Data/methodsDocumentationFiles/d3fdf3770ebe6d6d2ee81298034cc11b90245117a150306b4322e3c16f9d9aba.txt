     * Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a
     * shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread
     * is interrupted, whichever happens first. Because the {@link
     * #commonPool()} never terminates until program shutdown, when
     * applied to the common pool, this method is equivalent to {@link
     * #awaitQuiescence(long, TimeUnit)} but always returns {@code false}.
     *
     * @param timeout the maximum time to wait
     * @param unit the time unit of the timeout argument
     * @return {@code true} if this executor terminated and
     *         {@code false} if the timeout elapsed before termination
     * @throws InterruptedException if interrupted while waiting
