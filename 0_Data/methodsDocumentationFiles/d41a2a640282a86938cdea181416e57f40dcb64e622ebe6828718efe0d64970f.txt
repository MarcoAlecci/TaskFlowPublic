     * <p>Version of {@link #removeStickyBroadcast(Intent)} that allows you to specify the
     * user the broadcast will be sent to.  This is not available to applications
     * that are not pre-installed on the system image.
     *
     * <p>You must hold the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BROADCAST_STICKY}
     * permission in order to use this API.  If you do not hold that
     * permission, {@link SecurityException} will be thrown.
     *
     * @deprecated Sticky broadcasts should not be used.  They provide no security (anyone
     * can access them), no protection (anyone can modify them), and many other problems.
     * The recommended pattern is to use a non-sticky broadcast to report that <em>something</em>
     * has changed, with another mechanism for apps to retrieve the current value whenever
     * desired.
     *
     * @param intent The Intent that was previously broadcast.
     * @param user UserHandle to remove the sticky broadcast from.
