     * Get the Tag Identifier (if it has one).
     * <p>The tag identifier is a low level serial number, used for anti-collision
     * and identification.
     * <p> Most tags have a stable unique identifier
     * (UID), but some tags will generate a random ID every time they are discovered
     * (RID), and there are some tags with no ID at all (the byte array will be zero-sized).
     * <p> The size and format of an ID is specific to the RF technology used by the tag.
     * <p> This function retrieves the ID as determined at discovery time, and does not
     * perform any further RF communication or block.
     * @return ID as byte array, never null
