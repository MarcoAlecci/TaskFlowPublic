     * A given CharacterStyle can only applied to a single region of a given
     * Spanned.  If you need to attach the same CharacterStyle to multiple
     * regions, you can use this method to wrap it with a new object that
     * will have the same effect but be a distinct object so that it can
     * also be attached without conflict.
