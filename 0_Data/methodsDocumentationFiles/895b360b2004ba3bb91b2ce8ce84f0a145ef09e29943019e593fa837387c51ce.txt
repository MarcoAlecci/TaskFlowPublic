         * formats such as 720x576 4:3 and 720x576 16:9 where pixels are not square. By default,
         * applications assume the value of 1.0 (square pixels), so it is not necessary to set the
         * pixel aspect ratio for most video formats.
         *
         * @param videoPixelAspectRatio The pixel aspect ratio of the video.
         * @throws IllegalStateException if not called on a video track
