     * Posts a message to an object that implements Runnable.
     * Causes the Runnable r to executed on the next iteration through the
     * message queue. The runnable will be run on the thread to which this
     * handler is attached.
     * <b>This method is only for use in very special circumstances -- it
     * can easily starve the message queue, cause ordering problems, or have
     * other unexpected side-effects.</b>
     *  
     * @param r The Runnable that will be executed.
     * 
     * @return Returns true if the message was successfully placed in to the 
     *         message queue.  Returns false on failure, usually because the
     *         looper processing the message queue is exiting.
