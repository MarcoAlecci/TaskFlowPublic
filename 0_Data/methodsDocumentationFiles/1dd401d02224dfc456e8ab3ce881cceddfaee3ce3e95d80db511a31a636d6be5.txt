     * Tests if the set of UIDs that this network applies to is the same as the passed network.
     * <p>
     * This test only checks whether equal range objects are in both sets. It will
     * return false if the ranges are not exactly the same, even if the covered UIDs
     * are for an equivalent result.
     * <p>
     * Note that this method is not very optimized, which is fine as long as it's not used very
     * often.
     * <p>
     * nc is assumed nonnull.
