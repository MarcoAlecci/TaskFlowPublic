     * Return the frame size in bytes.
     *
     * For PCM or PCM packed compressed data this is the size of a sample multiplied
     * by the channel count. For all other cases, including invalid/unset channel masks,
     * this will return 1 byte.
     * As an example, a stereo 16-bit PCM format would have a frame size of 4 bytes,
     * an 8 channel float PCM format would have a frame size of 32 bytes,
     * and a compressed data format (not packed in PCM) would have a frame size of 1 byte.
     *
     * Both {@link AudioRecord} or {@link AudioTrack} process data in multiples of
     * this frame size.
     *
     * @return The audio frame size in bytes corresponding to the encoding and the channel mask.
