         * Trigger a dialog that lists the various methods of interacting with
         * the requested {@link Contacts} entry. This may be based on available
         * {@link ContactsContract.Data} rows under that contact, and may also
         * include social status and presence details.
         *
         * @param context The parent {@link Context} that may be used as the
         *            parent for this dialog.
         * @param target Specific {@link View} from your layout that this dialog
         *            should be centered around. In particular, if the dialog
         *            has a "callout" arrow, it will be pointed and centered
         *            around this {@link View}.
         * @param lookupUri A
         *            {@link ContactsContract.Contacts#CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI} style
         *            {@link Uri} that describes a specific contact to feature
         *            in this dialog. A work lookup uri is supported here,
         *            see {@link CommonDataKinds.Email#ENTERPRISE_CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI} and
         *            {@link PhoneLookup#ENTERPRISE_CONTENT_FILTER_URI}.
         * @param excludeMimes Optional list of {@link Data#MIMETYPE} MIME-types
         *            to exclude when showing this dialog. For example, when
         *            already viewing the contact details card, this can be used
         *            to omit the details entry from the dialog.
         * @param prioritizedMimeType This mimetype should be prioritized in the QuickContacts UI.
         *             For example, passing the value
         *             {@link CommonDataKinds.Phone#CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE} can cause phone numbers to be
         *             displayed more prominently in QuickContacts.
