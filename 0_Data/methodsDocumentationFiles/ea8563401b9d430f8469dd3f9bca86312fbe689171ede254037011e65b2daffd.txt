     * Checks if a given number might *potentially* result in a call to an
     * emergency service, for a specific country.
     *
     * Specifically, this method will return true if the specified number
     * is an emergency number in the specified country, *or* if the number
     * simply starts with the same digits as any emergency number for that
     * country.
     *
     * This method is intended for internal use by the phone app when
     * deciding whether to allow ACTION_CALL intents from 3rd party apps
     * (where we're required to *not* allow emergency calls to be placed.)
     *
     * @param number the number to look up.
     * @param defaultCountryIso the specific country which the number should be checked against
     * @return true if the number is an emergency number for the specific
     *         country, *or* if the number starts with the same digits as
     *         any of those emergency numbers.
