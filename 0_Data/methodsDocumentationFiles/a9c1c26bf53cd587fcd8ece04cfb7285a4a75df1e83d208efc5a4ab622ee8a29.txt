     * Returns a {@code Stream}, the elements of which are lines read from
     * this {@code BufferedReader}.  The {@link Stream} is lazily populated,
     * i.e., read only occurs during the
     * <a href="../util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps">terminal
     * stream operation</a>.
     *
     * <p> The reader must not be operated on during the execution of the
     * terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
     * operation is undefined.
     *
     * <p> After execution of the terminal stream operation there are no
     * guarantees that the reader will be at a specific position from which to
     * read the next character or line.
     *
     * <p> If an {@link IOException} is thrown when accessing the underlying
     * {@code BufferedReader}, it is wrapped in an {@link
     * UncheckedIOException} which will be thrown from the {@code Stream}
     * method that caused the read to take place. This method will return a
     * Stream if invoked on a BufferedReader that is closed. Any operation on
     * that stream that requires reading from the BufferedReader after it is
     * closed, will cause an UncheckedIOException to be thrown.
     *
     * @return a {@code Stream<String>} providing the lines of text
