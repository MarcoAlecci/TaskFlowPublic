     * Returns a {@link Cursor} of all the ringtones available. The returned
     * cursor will be the same cursor returned each time this method is called,
     * so do not {@link Cursor#close()} the cursor. The cursor can be
     * {@link Cursor#deactivate()} safely.
     * <p>
     * If {@link RingtoneManager#RingtoneManager(Activity)} was not used, the
     * caller should manage the returned cursor through its activity's life
     * cycle to prevent leaking the cursor.
     * <p>
     * Note that the list of ringtones available will differ depending on whether the caller
     * has the {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} permission.
