     * Plays the earcon using the specified queueing mode and parameters.
     * The earcon must already have been added with {@link #addEarcon(String, String)} or
     * {@link #addEarcon(String, String, int)}.
     * This method is asynchronous, i.e. the method just adds the request to the queue of TTS
     * requests and then returns. The synthesis might not have finished (or even started!) at the
     * time when this method returns. In order to reliably detect errors during synthesis,
     * we recommend setting an utterance progress listener (see
     * {@link #setOnUtteranceProgressListener}) and using the
     * {@link Engine#KEY_PARAM_UTTERANCE_ID} parameter.
     *
     * @param earcon The earcon that should be played
     * @param queueMode {@link #QUEUE_ADD} or {@link #QUEUE_FLUSH}.
     * @param params Parameters for the request. Can be null.
     *            Supported parameter names:
     *            {@link Engine#KEY_PARAM_STREAM},
     *            Engine specific parameters may be passed in but the parameter keys
     *            must be prefixed by the name of the engine they are intended for. For example
     *            the keys "com.svox.pico_foo" and "com.svox.pico:bar" will be passed to the
     *            engine named "com.svox.pico" if it is being used.
     *
     * @return {@link #ERROR} or {@link #SUCCESS} of <b>queuing</b> the playEarcon operation.
