     * Get the per-thread CPU usage of all processes belonging to a set of UIDs
     *
     * <p>This function will crawl through all process {@code proc} directories found by the pattern
     * {@code /proc/[0-9]*}, and then check the UID using {@code /proc/$PID/status}. This takes
     * approximately 500ms on a 2017 device. Therefore, this method can be computationally
     * expensive, and should not be called more than once an hour.
     *
     * <p>Data is only collected for UIDs passing the predicate supplied in {@link
     * #setUidPredicate}.
