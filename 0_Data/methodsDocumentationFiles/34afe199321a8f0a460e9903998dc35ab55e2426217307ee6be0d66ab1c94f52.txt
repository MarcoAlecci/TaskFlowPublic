     * Forward hover events to the delegate view if the event is within the bounds
     * specified in the constructor and touch exploration is enabled.
     *
     * <p>This method is provided for accessibility purposes so touch exploration, which is
     * commonly used by screen readers, can properly place accessibility focus on views that
     * use touch delegates. Therefore, touch exploration must be enabled for hover events
     * to be dispatched through the delegate.</p>
     *
     * @param event The hover event to forward
     * @return True if the event was consumed by the delegate, false otherwise.
