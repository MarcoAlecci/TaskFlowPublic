     * The utility method to check whether a host name is in a domain or not.
     *
     * <p> This concept is described in the cookie specification.
     * To understand the concept, some terminologies need to be defined first:
     * <blockquote>
     * effective host name = hostname if host name contains dot<br>
     * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or = hostname.local if not
     * </blockquote>
     * <p>Host A's name domain-matches host B's if:
     * <blockquote><ul>
     *   <li>their host name strings string-compare equal; or</li>
     *   <li>A is a HDN string and has the form NB, where N is a non-empty
     *   name string, B has the form .B', and B' is a HDN string.  (So,
     *   x.y.com domain-matches .Y.com but not Y.com.)</li>
     * </ul></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>A host isn't in a domain (RFC 2965 sec. 3.3.2) if:
     * <blockquote><ul>
     *   <li>The value for the Domain attribute contains no embedded dots,
     *   and the value is not .local.</li>
     *   <li>The effective host name that derives from the request-host does
     *   not domain-match the Domain attribute.</li>
     *   <li>The request-host is a HDN (not IP address) and has the form HD,
     *   where D is the value of the Domain attribute, and H is a string
     *   that contains one or more dots.</li>
     * </ul></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>Examples:
     * <blockquote><ul>
     *   <li>A Set-Cookie2 from request-host y.x.foo.com for Domain=.foo.com
     *   would be rejected, because H is y.x and contains a dot.</li>
     *   <li>A Set-Cookie2 from request-host x.foo.com for Domain=.foo.com
     *   would be accepted.</li>
     *   <li>A Set-Cookie2 with Domain=.com or Domain=.com., will always be
     *   rejected, because there is no embedded dot.</li>
     *   <li>A Set-Cookie2 from request-host example for Domain=.local will
     *   be accepted, because the effective host name for the request-
     *   host is example.local, and example.local domain-matches .local.</li>
     * </ul></blockquote>
     *
     * @param  domain
     *         the domain name to check host name with
     *
     * @param  host
     *         the host name in question
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if they domain-matches; {@code false} if not
