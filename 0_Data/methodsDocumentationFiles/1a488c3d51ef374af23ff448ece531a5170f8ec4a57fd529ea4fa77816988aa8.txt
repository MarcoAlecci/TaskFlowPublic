         * Defines the bounds of the rectangle where the magnifier will be able to copy its content
         * from. The content will always be copied from the {@link Surface} of the main application
         * window unless the magnified view is a {@link SurfaceView}, in which case its backing
         * surface will be used. Each bound can have a different behavior, with the options being:
         * <ul>
         *   <li>{@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_VISIBLE}, which extends the bound as much as possible
         *   while remaining in the visible region of the magnified view, as given by
         *   {@link android.view.View#getGlobalVisibleRect(Rect)}. For example, this will take into
         *   account the case when the view is contained in a scrollable container, and the
         *   magnifier will refuse to copy content outside of the visible view region</li>
         *   <li>{@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE}, which extends the bound as much
         *   as possible while remaining inside the surface the content is copied from.</li>
         * </ul>
         * Note that if either of the first three options is used, the bound will be compared to
         * the bound of the surface (i.e. as if {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE} was used),
         * and the more restrictive one will be chosen. In other words, no attempt to copy content
         * from outside the surface will be permitted. If two opposite bounds are not well-behaved
         * (i.e. left + sourceWidth > right or top + sourceHeight > bottom), the left and top
         * bounds will have priority and the others will be extended accordingly. If the pairs
         * obtained this way still remain out of bounds, the smallest possible offset will be added
         * to the pairs to bring them inside the surface bounds. If this is impossible
         * (i.e. the surface is too small for the size of the content we try to copy on either
         * dimension), an error will be logged and the magnifier content will look distorted.
         * The default values assumed by the builder for the source bounds are
         * left: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_VISIBLE}, top: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE},
         * right: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_VISIBLE}, bottom: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE}.
         * @param left the left bound for content copy
         * @param top the top bound for content copy
         * @param right the right bound for content copy
         * @param bottom the bottom bound for content copy
