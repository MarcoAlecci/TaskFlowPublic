     * Provide a binder to an already-bound service.  This method is synchronous
     * and will not start the target service if it is not present, so it is safe
     * to call from {@link #onReceive}.
     *
     * For peekService() to return a non null {@link android.os.IBinder} interface
     * the service must have published it before. In other words some component
     * must have called {@link android.content.Context#bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)} on it.
     *
     * @param myContext The Context that had been passed to {@link #onReceive(Context, Intent)}
     * @param service Identifies the already-bound service you wish to use. See
     * {@link android.content.Context#bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)}
     * for more information.
