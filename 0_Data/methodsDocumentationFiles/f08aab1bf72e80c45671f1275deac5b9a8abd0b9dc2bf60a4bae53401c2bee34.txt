     * Creates a ResourcesProvider from an APK ({@code .apk}) file descriptor.
     *
     * <p>The file descriptor is duplicated and the original may be closed by the application at any
     * time without affecting the ResourcesProvider.
     *
     * <p>The assets provider can override the loading of files within the APK and can provide
     * entirely new files that do not exist in the APK.
     *
     * @param fileDescriptor the file descriptor of the APK to load
     * @param offset The location within the file that the apk starts. This must be 0 if length is
     *               {@link AssetFileDescriptor#UNKNOWN_LENGTH}.
     * @param length The number of bytes of the apk, or {@link AssetFileDescriptor#UNKNOWN_LENGTH}
     *               if it extends to the end of the file.
     * @param assetsProvider the assets provider that overrides the loading of file-based resources
