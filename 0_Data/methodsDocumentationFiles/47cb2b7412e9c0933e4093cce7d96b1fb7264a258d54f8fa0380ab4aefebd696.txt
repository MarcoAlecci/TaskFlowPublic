         * Called whenever camera access priorities change.
         *
         * <p>Notification that camera access priorities have changed and the camera may
         * now be openable. An application that was previously denied camera access due to
         * a higher-priority user already using the camera, or that was disconnected from an
         * active camera session due to a higher-priority user trying to open the camera,
         * should try to open the camera again if it still wants to use it.  Note that
         * multiple applications may receive this callback at the same time, and only one of
         * them will succeed in opening the camera in practice, depending on exact access
         * priority levels and timing. This method is useful in cases where multiple
         * applications may be in the resumed state at the same time, and the user switches
         * focus between them, or if the current camera-using application moves between
         * full-screen and Picture-in-Picture (PiP) states. In such cases, the camera
         * available/unavailable callbacks will not be invoked, but another application may
         * now have higher priority for camera access than the current camera-using
         * application.</p>

         * <p>The default implementation of this method does nothing.</p>
