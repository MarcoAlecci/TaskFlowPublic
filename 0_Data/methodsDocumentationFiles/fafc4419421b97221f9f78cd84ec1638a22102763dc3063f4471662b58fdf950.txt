         * Devices may support a variety of user interactions, and all interactions cannot be
         * represented with a single {@link ControlTemplate}. Therefore, the selected template
         * should be most closely aligned with what the expected primary device action will be.
         * Any secondary interactions can be done via the {@link #setAppIntent(PendingIntent)}.
