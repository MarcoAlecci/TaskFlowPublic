     * Enables the specified transitionType for this LayoutTransition object.
     * By default, a LayoutTransition listens for changes in children being
     * added/remove/hidden/shown in the container, and runs the animations associated with
     * those events. That is, all transition types besides {@link #CHANGING} are enabled by default.
     * You can also enable {@link #CHANGING} animations by calling this method with the
     * {@link #CHANGING} transitionType.
     *
     * @param transitionType One of {@link #CHANGE_APPEARING}, {@link #CHANGE_DISAPPEARING},
     * {@link #CHANGING}, {@link #APPEARING}, or {@link #DISAPPEARING}.
