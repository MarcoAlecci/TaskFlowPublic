     * Called by the app to request data sharing via writing to a file.
     *
     * <p>The ContentCaptureService app will receive a read-only file descriptor pointing to the
     * same file and will be able to read data being shared from it.
     *
     * <p>Note: using this API doesn't guarantee the app staying alive and is "best-effort".
     * Starting a foreground service would minimize the chances of the app getting killed during the
     * file sharing session.
     *
     * @param request object specifying details of the data being shared.
