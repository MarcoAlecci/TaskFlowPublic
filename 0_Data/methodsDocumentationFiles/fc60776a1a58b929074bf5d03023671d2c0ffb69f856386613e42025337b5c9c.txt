         * Retrieves the dispatch mode of this listener. Dispatch of the all animation events is
         * hierarchical: It will starts at the root of the view hierarchy and then traverse it and
         * invoke the callback of the specific {@link View} that is being traversed.
         * The method may return either {@link #DISPATCH_MODE_CONTINUE_ON_SUBTREE} to indicate that
         * animation events should be propagated to the subtree of the view hierarchy, or
         * {@link #DISPATCH_MODE_STOP} to stop dispatching. In that case, all animation callbacks
         * related to the animation passed in will be stopped from propagating to the subtree of the
         * hierarchy.
         * <p>
         * Also note that {@link #DISPATCH_MODE_STOP} behaves the same way as
         * returning {@link WindowInsets#CONSUMED} during the regular insets dispatch in
         * {@link View#onApplyWindowInsets}.
         *
         * @return Either {@link #DISPATCH_MODE_CONTINUE_ON_SUBTREE} to indicate that dispatching of
         *         animation events will continue to the subtree of the view hierarchy, or
         *         {@link #DISPATCH_MODE_STOP} to indicate that animation events will stop
         *         dispatching.
