     * Return a new Context object for the current Context but whose resources
     * are adjusted to match the metrics of the given Display.  Each call to this method
     * returns a new instance of a Context object; Context objects are not
     * shared, however common state (ClassLoader, other Resources for the
     * same configuration) may be so the Context itself can be fairly lightweight.
     *
     * To obtain an instance of a {@link WindowManager} (see {@link #getSystemService(String)}) that
     * is configured to show windows on the given display call
     * {@link #createWindowContext(int, Bundle)} on the returned display Context or use an
     * {@link android.app.Activity}.
     *
     * @param display A {@link Display} object specifying the display for whose metrics the
     * Context's resources should be tailored.
     *
     * @return A {@link Context} for the display.
