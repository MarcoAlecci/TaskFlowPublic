     * <p>The MIFARE Ultralight protocol always reads 4 pages at a time, to
     * reduce the number of commands required to read an entire tag.
     * <p>If a read spans past the last readable block, then the tag will
     * return pages that have been wrapped back to the first blocks. MIFARE
     * Ultralight tags have readable blocks 0x00 through 0x0F. So a read to
     * block offset 0x0E would return blocks 0x0E, 0x0F, 0x00, 0x01. MIFARE
     * Ultralight C tags have readable blocks 0x00 through 0x2B. So a read to
     * block 0x2A would return blocks 0x2A, 0x2B, 0x00, 0x01.
     *
     * <p>This is an I/O operation and will block until complete. It must
     * not be called from the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
     * {@link IOException} if {@link #close} is called from another thread.
