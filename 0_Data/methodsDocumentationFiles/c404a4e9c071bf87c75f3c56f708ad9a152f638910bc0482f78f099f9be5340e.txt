     * Retrieve text from a package.  This is a low-level API used by
     * the various package manager info structures (such as
     * {@link ComponentInfo} to implement retrieval of their associated
     * labels and other text.
     *
     * @param packageName The name of the package that this text is coming from.
     * Cannot be null.
     * @param resid The resource identifier of the desired text.  Cannot be 0.
     * @param appInfo Overall information about <var>packageName</var>.  This
     * may be null, in which case the application information will be retrieved
     * for you if needed; if you already have this information around, it can
     * be much more efficient to supply it here.
     *
     * @return Returns a CharSequence holding the requested text.  Returns null
     * if the text could not be found for any reason.
