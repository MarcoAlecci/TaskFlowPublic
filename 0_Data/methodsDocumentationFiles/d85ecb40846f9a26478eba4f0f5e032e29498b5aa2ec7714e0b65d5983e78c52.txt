     * Flushes the FIFO of all the sensors registered for this listener. If there are events
     * in the FIFO of the sensor, they are returned as if the maxReportLantecy of the FIFO has
     * expired. Events are returned in the usual way through the SensorEventListener.
     * This call doesn't affect the maxReportLantecy for this sensor. This call is asynchronous and
     * returns immediately.
     * {@link android.hardware.SensorEventListener2#onFlushCompleted onFlushCompleted} is called
     * after all the events in the batch at the time of calling this method have been delivered
     * successfully. If the hardware doesn't support flush, it still returns true and a trivial
     * flush complete event is sent after the current event for all the clients registered for this
     * sensor.
     *
     * @param listener A {@link android.hardware.SensorEventListener SensorEventListener} object
     *        which was previously used in a registerListener call.
     * @return <code>true</code> if the flush is initiated successfully on all the sensors
     *         registered for this listener, false if no sensor is previously registered for this
     *         listener or flush on one of the sensors fails.
     * @see #registerListener(SensorEventListener, Sensor, int, int)
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException when listener is null.
