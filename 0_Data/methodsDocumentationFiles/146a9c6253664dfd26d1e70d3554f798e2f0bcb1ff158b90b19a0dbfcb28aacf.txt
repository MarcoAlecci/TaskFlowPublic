     * Sets the data source (file-path or http URL) to use.
     *
     * @param path the path of the file, or the http URL of the stream
     *
     * <p>When <code>path</code> refers to a local file, the file may actually be opened by a
     * process other than the calling application.  This implies that the pathname
     * should be an absolute path (as any other process runs with unspecified current working
     * directory), and that the pathname should reference a world-readable file.
     * As an alternative, the application could first open the file for reading,
     * and then use the file descriptor form {@link #setDataSource(FileDescriptor)}.
     *
     * <p>When <code>path</code> refers to a network file the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#INTERNET} permission is required.
