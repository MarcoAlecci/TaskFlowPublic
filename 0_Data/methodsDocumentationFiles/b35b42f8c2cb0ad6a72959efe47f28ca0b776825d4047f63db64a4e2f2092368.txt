     * Constructs and returns an ObjectAnimator that animates coordinates along a <code>Path</code>
     * using two properties. A <code>Path</code></> animation moves in two dimensions, animating
     * coordinates <code>(x, y)</code> together to follow the line. In this variation, the
     * coordinates are floats that are set to separate properties designated by
     * <code>xPropertyName</code> and <code>yPropertyName</code>.
     *
     * @param target The object whose properties are to be animated. This object should
     *               have public methods on it called <code>setNameX()</code> and
     *               <code>setNameY</code>, where <code>nameX</code> and <code>nameY</code>
     *               are the value of the <code>xPropertyName</code> and <code>yPropertyName</code>
     *               parameters, respectively.
     * @param xPropertyName The name of the property for the x coordinate being animated.
     * @param yPropertyName The name of the property for the y coordinate being animated.
     * @param path The <code>Path</code> to animate values along.
     * @return An ObjectAnimator object that is set up to animate along <code>path</code>.
