     * Tries to remove from the work queue all {@link Future}
     * tasks that have been cancelled. This method can be useful as a
     * storage reclamation operation, that has no other impact on
     * functionality. Cancelled tasks are never executed, but may
     * accumulate in work queues until worker threads can actively
     * remove them. Invoking this method instead tries to remove them now.
     * However, this method may fail to remove tasks in
     * the presence of interference by other threads.
