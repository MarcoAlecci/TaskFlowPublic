     * Given a canonical Uri previously generated by {@link #canonicalize}, convert
     * it to its local non-canonical form.  This can be useful in some cases where
     * you know that you will only be using the Uri in the current environment and
     * want to avoid any possible overhead when using it with the content
     * provider or want to verify that the referenced data exists at all in the
     * new environment.
     *
     * @param url The canonical {@link Uri} that is to be convered back to its
     * non-canonical form.
     *
     * @return Returns the non-canonical representation of <var>url</var>.  This will
     * return null if data identified by the canonical Uri can not be found in
     * the current environment; callers must always check for null and deal with
     * that by appropriately falling back to an alternative.
