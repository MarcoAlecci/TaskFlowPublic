     * immediately when this method is called. If recording has not yet started in the current
     * recording session, this method does nothing.
     *
     * <p>The recording session is expected to create a new data entry in the
     * {@link android.media.tv.TvContract.RecordedPrograms} table that describes the newly
     * recorded program and pass the URI to that entry through to
     * {@link RecordingCallback#onRecordingStopped(Uri)}.
     * If the stop request cannot be fulfilled, the recording session will respond by calling
     * {@link RecordingCallback#onError(int)}.
