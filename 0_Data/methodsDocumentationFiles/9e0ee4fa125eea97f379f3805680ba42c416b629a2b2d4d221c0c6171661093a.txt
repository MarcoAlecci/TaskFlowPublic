     * add content to the directory only via the APIs on this class. To open a
     * file for writing in this directory you should use {@link #openWrite(File)}
     * and to close the file {@link #closeWrite(FileOutputStream)}. Once all
     * content has been written and all files closed you should commit via a
     * call to {@link #finishWrite()} or discard via a call to {@link #failWrite()}.
