     * Initializes this key agreement with the given key and source of
     * randomness. The given key is required to contain all the algorithm
     * parameters required for this key agreement.
     *
     * <p> If the key agreement algorithm requires random bytes, it gets them
     * from the given source of randomness, <code>random</code>.
     * However, if the underlying
     * algorithm implementation does not require any random bytes,
     * <code>random</code> is ignored.
     *
     * @param key the party's private information. For example, in the case
     * of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, this would be the party's own
     * Diffie-Hellman private key.
     * @param random the source of randomness
     *
     * @exception InvalidKeyException if the given key is
     * inappropriate for this key agreement, e.g., is of the wrong type or
     * has an incompatible algorithm type.
