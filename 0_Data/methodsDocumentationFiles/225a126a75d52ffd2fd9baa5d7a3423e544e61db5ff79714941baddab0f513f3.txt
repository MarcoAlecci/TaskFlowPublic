             * Detect when the calling application exposes a {@code file://} {@link android.net.Uri}
             * to another app.
             *
             * <p>This exposure is discouraged since the receiving app may not have access to the
             * shared path. For example, the receiving app may not have requested the {@link
             * android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} runtime permission, or the
             * platform may be sharing the {@link android.net.Uri} across user profile boundaries.
             *
             * <p>Instead, apps should use {@code content://} Uris so the platform can extend
             * temporary permission for the receiving app to access the resource.
