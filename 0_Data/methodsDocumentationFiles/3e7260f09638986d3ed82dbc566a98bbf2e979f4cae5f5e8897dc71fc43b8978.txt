     * Flatten a List containing a particular object type into the parcel, at
     * the current dataPosition() and growing dataCapacity() if needed.  The
     * type of the objects in the list must be one that implements Parcelable.
     * Unlike the generic writeList() method, however, only the raw data of the
     * objects is written and not their type, so you must use the corresponding
     * readTypedList() to unmarshall them.
     *
     * @param val The list of objects to be written.
