     * Set whether the Render node should clip itself to its bounds. This defaults to true,
     * and is useful to the renderer in enable quick-rejection of chunks of the tree as well as
     * better partial invalidation support. Clipping can be further restricted or controlled
     * through the combination of this property as well as {@link #setClipRect(Rect)}, which
     * allows for a different clipping rectangle to be used in addition to or instead of the
     * {@link #setPosition(int, int, int, int)} or the RenderNode.
     *
     * @param clipToBounds true if the display list should clip to its bounds, false otherwise.
     * @return True if the value changed, false if the new value was the same as the previous value.
