     * Called by a device or profile owner, or delegated certificate chooser (an app that has been
     * delegated the {@link #DELEGATION_CERT_SELECTION} privilege), to grant an application access
     * to an already-installed (or generated) KeyChain key.
     * This is useful (in combination with {@link #installKeyPair} or {@link #generateKeyPair}) to
     * let an application call {@link android.security.KeyChain#getPrivateKey} without having to
     * call {@link android.security.KeyChain#choosePrivateKeyAlias} first.
     *
     * The grantee app will receive the {@link android.security.KeyChain#ACTION_KEY_ACCESS_CHANGED}
     * broadcast when access to a key is granted.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or
     *        {@code null} if calling from a delegated certificate installer.
     * @param alias The alias of the key to grant access to.
     * @param packageName The name of the (already installed) package to grant access to.
     * @return {@code true} if the grant was set successfully, {@code false} otherwise.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller is not a device owner, a profile owner or
     *         delegated certificate chooser.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code packageName} or {@code alias} are empty, or if
     *         {@code packageName} is not a name of an installed package.
