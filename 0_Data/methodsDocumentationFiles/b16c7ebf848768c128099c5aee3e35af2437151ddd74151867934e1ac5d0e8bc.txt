     * Called by the framework in response to a text completion from
     * the current input method, provided by it calling
     * {@link InputConnection#commitCompletion
     * InputConnection.commitCompletion()}.  The default implementation does
     * nothing; text views that are supporting auto-completion should override
     * this to do their desired behavior.
     *
     * @param text The auto complete text the user has selected.
