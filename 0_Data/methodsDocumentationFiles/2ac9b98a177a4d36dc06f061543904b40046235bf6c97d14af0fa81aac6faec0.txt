     * Called to retrieve resolve info for instant applications immediately. The response will be
     * ignored if not provided within a reasonable time. {@link InstantAppResolveInfo}s provided
     * in response to this method may be partial to request a second phase of resolution which will
     * result in a subsequent call to {@link #onGetInstantAppIntentFilter(Intent, int[], UserHandle,
     * String, InstantAppResolutionCallback)}
     *
     * @param sanitizedIntent The sanitized {@link Intent} used for resolution. A sanitized Intent
     *                        is an intent with potential PII removed from the original intent.
     *                        Fields removed include extras and the host + path of the data, if
     *                        defined.
     * @param hostDigestPrefix The hash prefix of the instant app's domain.
     * @param userHandle The user for which to resolve the instant app.
     * @param token A unique identifier that will be provided in calls to {@link
     *              #onGetInstantAppIntentFilter(Intent, int[], UserHandle, String,
     *              InstantAppResolutionCallback)} and provided to the installer via {@link
     *              Intent#EXTRA_INSTANT_APP_TOKEN} to tie a single launch together.
     * @param callback The {@link InstantAppResolutionCallback} to provide results to.
