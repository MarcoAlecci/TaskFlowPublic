     * Sets the system-wide night mode.
     * <p>
     * The mode can be one of:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><em>{@link #MODE_NIGHT_NO}<em> sets the device into
     *       {@code notnight} mode</li>
     *   <li><em>{@link #MODE_NIGHT_YES}</em> sets the device into
     *       {@code night} mode</li>
     *   <li><em>{@link #MODE_NIGHT_CUSTOM}</em> automatically switches between
     *       {@code night} and {@code notnight} based on the custom time set (or default)</li>
     *   <li><em>{@link #MODE_NIGHT_AUTO}</em> automatically switches between
     *       {@code night} and {@code notnight} based on the device's current
     *       location and certain other sensors</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> On API 22 and below, changes to the night mode
     * are only effective when the {@link Configuration#UI_MODE_TYPE_CAR car}
     * or {@link Configuration#UI_MODE_TYPE_DESK desk} mode is enabled on a
     * device. On API 23 through API 28, changes to night mode are always effective.
     * <p>
     * Starting in API 29, when the device is in car mode and this method is called, night mode
     * will change, but the new setting is not persisted and the previously persisted setting
     * will be restored when the device exits car mode.
     * <p>
     * Changes to night mode take effect globally and will result in a configuration change
     * (and potentially an Activity lifecycle event) being applied to all running apps.
     * Developers interested in an app-local implementation of night mode should consider using
     * {@link android.support.v7.app.AppCompatDelegate#setDefaultNightMode(int)} to manage the
     * -night qualifier locally.
     *
     * @param mode the night mode to set
     * @see #getNightMode()
