     * If the target user is a profile of the calling user or the caller
     * is itself a profile, then this returns a badged copy of the given
     * drawable allowing the user to distinguish it from the original drawable.
     * The caller can specify the location in the bounds of the drawable to be
     * badged where the badge should be applied as well as the density of the
     * badge to be used.
     * <p>
     * If the original drawable is a BitmapDrawable and the backing bitmap is
     * mutable as per {@link android.graphics.Bitmap#isMutable()}, the badging
     * is performed in place and the original drawable is returned.
     * </p>

     * @param badgedDrawable The drawable to badge.
     * @param user The target user.
     * @param badgeLocation Where in the bounds of the badged drawable to place
     *         the badge. If it's {@code null}, the badge is applied on top of the entire
     *         drawable being badged.
     * @param badgeDensity The optional desired density for the badge as per
     *         {@link android.util.DisplayMetrics#densityDpi}. If it's not positive,
     *         the density of the display is used.
     * @return A drawable that combines the original drawable and a badge as
     *         determined by the system.
