     * Adds a frame commit callback. This callback will be invoked when the current rendering
     * content has been rendered into a frame and submitted to the swap chain. The frame may
     * not currently be visible on the display when this is invoked, but it has been submitted.
     * This callback is useful in combination with {@link PixelCopy} to capture the current
     * rendered content of the UI reliably.
     *
     * Note: Only works with hardware rendering. Does nothing otherwise.
     *
     * @param callback The callback to invoke when the frame is committed.
