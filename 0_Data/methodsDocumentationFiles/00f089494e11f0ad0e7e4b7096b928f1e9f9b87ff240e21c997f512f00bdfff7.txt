     * Call this method after setDataSource(). This method finds a
     * representative frame at any time position if possible,
     * and returns it as a bitmap. Call this method if one does not
     * care about where the frame is located; otherwise, please call
     * {@link #getFrameAtTime(long)} or {@link #getFrameAtTime(long, int)}
     *
     * <p>If you don't need a full-resolution
     * frame (for example, because you need a thumbnail image), use
     * {@link #getScaledFrameAtTime getScaledFrameAtTime()} instead of this
     * method.</p>
     *
     * @return A Bitmap containing a representative video frame, which
     *         can be null, if such a frame cannot be retrieved.
