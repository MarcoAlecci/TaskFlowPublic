     * Get set of permissions that have been split into more granular or dependent permissions.
     *
     * <p>E.g. before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q} an app that was granted
     * {@link Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION} could access he location while it was in
     * foreground and background. On platforms after {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}
     * the location permission only grants location access while the app is in foreground. This
     * would break apps that target before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}. Hence whenever
     * such an old app asks for a location permission (i.e. the
     * {@link SplitPermissionInfo#getSplitPermission()}), then the
     * {@link Manifest.permission#ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION} permission (inside
     * {@link SplitPermissionInfo#getNewPermissions}) is added.
     *
     * <p>Note: Regular apps do not have to worry about this. The platform and permission controller
     * automatically add the new permissions where needed.
     *
     * @return All permissions that are split.
