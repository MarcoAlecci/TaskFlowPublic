     * Performs the given action for each entry in this map until all entries
     * have been processed or the action throws an exception.   Unless
     * otherwise specified by the implementing class, actions are performed in
     * the order of entry set iteration (if an iteration order is specified.)
     * Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.

     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation is equivalent to, for this {@code map}:
     * <pre> {@code
     * for (Map.Entry<K, V> entry : map.entrySet())
     *     action.accept(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
     * }</pre>
     *
     * The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
     * or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
     * atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
     * concurrency properties.
     *
     * @param action The action to be performed for each entry
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified action is null
     * @throws ConcurrentModificationException if an entry is found to be
     * removed during iteration
