     * Notify the host application that the web page wants to display a
     * JavaScript {@code alert()} dialog.
     * <p>The default behavior if this method returns {@code false} or is not
     * overridden is to show a dialog containing the alert message and suspend
     * JavaScript execution until the dialog is dismissed.
     * <p>To show a custom dialog, the app should return {@code true} from this
     * method, in which case the default dialog will not be shown and JavaScript
     * execution will be suspended. The app should call
     * {@code JsResult.confirm()} when the custom dialog is dismissed such that
     * JavaScript execution can be resumed.
     * <p>To suppress the dialog and allow JavaScript execution to
     * continue, call {@code JsResult.confirm()} immediately and then return
     * {@code true}.
     * <p>Note that if the {@link WebChromeClient} is set to be {@code null},
     * or if {@link WebChromeClient} is not set at all, the default dialog will
     * be suppressed and Javascript execution will continue immediately.
     * <p>Note that the default dialog does not inherit the {@link
     * android.view.Display#FLAG_SECURE} flag from the parent window.
     *
     * @param view The WebView that initiated the callback.
     * @param url The url of the page requesting the dialog.
     * @param message Message to be displayed in the window.
     * @param result A JsResult to confirm that the user closed the window.
     * @return boolean {@code true} if the request is handled or ignored.
     * {@code false} if WebView needs to show the default dialog.
