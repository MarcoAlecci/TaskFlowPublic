     * Retrieves the string value for the attribute at <var>index</var>, but
     * only if that string comes from an immediate value in an XML file.  That
     * is, this does not allow references to string resources, string
     * attributes, or conversions from other types.  As such, this method
     * will only return strings for TypedArray objects that come from
     * attributes in an XML file.
     *
     * @param index Index of attribute to retrieve.
     *
     * @return String holding string data. Any styling information is removed.
     *         Returns {@code null} if the attribute is not defined or is not
     *         an immediate string value.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the TypedArray has already been recycled.
