     * Returns the configured audio sink sample rate in Hz.
     * The sink sample rate never changes after construction.
     * If the constructor had a specific sample rate, then the sink sample rate is that value.
     * If the constructor had {@link AudioFormat#SAMPLE_RATE_UNSPECIFIED},
     * then the sink sample rate is a route-dependent default value based on the source [sic].
