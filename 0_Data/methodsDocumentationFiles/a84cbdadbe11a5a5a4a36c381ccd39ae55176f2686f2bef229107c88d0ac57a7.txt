     * Returns a description which explains the reason for the disconnect cause and is for display
     * in the user interface. This optional text is generally a longer and more descriptive version
     * of {@link #getLabel}, however it can exist even if {@link #getLabel} is empty. The In-Call UI
     * should display this relatively prominently; the traditional implementation displays this as
     * an alert dialog. The {@link ConnectionService} is responsible for providing and localizing
     * this message. If there is no string provided, returns null.

     * @return The disconnect description.
