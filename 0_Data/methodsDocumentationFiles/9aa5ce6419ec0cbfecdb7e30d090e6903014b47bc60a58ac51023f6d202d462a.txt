     * delegated the {@link #DELEGATION_CERT_SELECTION} privilege), to revoke an application's
     * grant to a KeyChain key pair.
     * Calls by the application to {@link android.security.KeyChain#getPrivateKey}
     * will fail after the grant is revoked.
     *
     * The grantee app will receive the {@link android.security.KeyChain#ACTION_KEY_ACCESS_CHANGED}
     * broadcast when access to a key is revoked.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or

     * @param alias The alias of the key to revoke access from.
     * @param packageName The name of the (already installed) package to revoke access from.
     * @return {@code true} if the grant was revoked successfully, {@code false} otherwise.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller is not a device owner, a profile owner or
     *         delegated certificate chooser.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code packageName} or {@code alias} are empty, or if
     *         {@code packageName} is not a name of an installed package.
