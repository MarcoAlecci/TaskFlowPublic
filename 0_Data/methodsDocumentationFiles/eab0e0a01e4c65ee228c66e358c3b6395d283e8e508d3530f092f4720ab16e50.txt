     * <p>
     * If dream can not be started, for example if another {@link PowerManager} transition is in
     * progress, does nothing. Unlike {@link #nap(long)}, this does not put device to sleep when
     * dream ends.
     * </p><p>
     * Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_DREAM_STATE} and
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_DREAM_STATE} permissions.

     *
     * @param time The time when the request to nap was issued, in the
     * {@link SystemClock#uptimeMillis()} time base.  This timestamp may be used to correctly
     * order the dream request with other power management functions.  It should be set
     * to the timestamp of the input event that caused the request to dream.
