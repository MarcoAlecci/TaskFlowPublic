     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} whose value is {@code this / divisor}.
     * The scale of the result is the scale of {@code this}. If rounding is
     * required to meet the specified scale, then the specified rounding mode
     * {@code roundingMode} is applied.
     *
     * @param divisor
     *            value by which {@code this} is divided.
     * @param roundingMode
     *            rounding mode to be used to round the result.
     * @return {@code this / divisor} rounded according to the given rounding
     *         mode.
     * @throws NullPointerException
     *             if {@code divisor == null} or {@code roundingMode == null}.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code divisor == 0}.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code roundingMode == RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY} and
     *             rounding is necessary according to the scale of this.
