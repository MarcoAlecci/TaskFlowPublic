     * Implement this to handle requests to update one or more rows. The
     * implementation should update all rows matching the selection to set the
     * columns according to the provided values map. As a courtesy, call
     * {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(android.net.Uri ,android.database.ContentObserver)
     * notifyChange()} after updating. This method can be called from multiple
     * threads, as described in <a href="
     * {@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     *
     * @param uri The URI to query. This can potentially have a record ID if
     *            this is an update request for a specific record.
     * @param values A set of column_name/value pairs to update in the database.
     * @param extras A Bundle containing additional information necessary for
     *            the operation. Arguments may include SQL style arguments, such
     *            as {@link ContentResolver#QUERY_ARG_SQL_LIMIT}, but note that
     *            the documentation for each individual provider will indicate
     *            which arguments they support.
     * @return the number of rows affected.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the provider doesn't support one of
     *             the requested Bundle arguments.
