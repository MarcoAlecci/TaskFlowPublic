     * Returns <tt>true</tt> if the two specified arrays of Objects are
     * <i>equal</i> to one another.  The two arrays are considered equal if
     * both arrays contain the same number of elements, and all corresponding
     * pairs of elements in the two arrays are equal.  Two objects <tt>e1</tt>
     * and <tt>e2</tt> are considered <i>equal</i> if <tt>(e1==null ? e2==null
     * : e1.equals(e2))</tt>.  In other words, the two arrays are equal if
     * they contain the same elements in the same order.  Also, two array
     * references are considered equal if both are <tt>null</tt>.<p>
     *
     * @param a one array to be tested for equality
     * @param a2 the other array to be tested for equality
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the two arrays are equal
