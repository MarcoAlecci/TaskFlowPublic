     * A special variation to launch an activity only if a new activity
     * instance is needed to handle the given Intent.  In other words, this is
     * just like {@link #startActivityForResult(Intent, int)} except: if you are
     * using the {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP} flag, or
     * singleTask or singleTop
     * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity_launchMode launchMode},
     * and the activity
     * that handles <var>intent</var> is the same as your currently running
     * activity, then a new instance is not needed.  In this case, instead of
     * the normal behavior of calling {@link #onNewIntent} this function will
     * return and you can handle the Intent yourself.
     *
     * <p>This function can only be called from a top-level activity; if it is
     * called from a child activity, a runtime exception will be thrown.
     *
     * @param intent The intent to start.
     * @param requestCode If >= 0, this code will be returned in
     *         onActivityResult() when the activity exits, as described in
     *         {@link #startActivityForResult}.
     * @param options Additional options for how the Activity should be started.
     * See {@link android.content.Context#startActivity(Intent, Bundle)}
     * Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.
     *
     * @return If a new activity was launched then true is returned; otherwise
     *         false is returned and you must handle the Intent yourself.
