     * Sends a {@code Call} event from this {@code Call} to the associated {@link Connection} in
     * the {@link ConnectionService}.
     * <p>
     * Call events are used to communicate point in time information from an {@link InCallService}
     * to a {@link ConnectionService}.  A {@link ConnectionService} implementation could define
     * events which enable the {@link InCallService}, for example, toggle a unique feature of the
     * {@link ConnectionService}.
     * <p>
     * A {@link ConnectionService} can communicate to the {@link InCallService} using
     * {@link Connection#sendConnectionEvent(String, Bundle)}.
     * <p>
     * Events are exposed to {@link ConnectionService} implementations via
     * {@link android.telecom.Connection#onCallEvent(String, Bundle)}.
     * <p>
     * No assumptions should be made as to how a {@link ConnectionService} will handle these events.
     * The {@link InCallService} must assume that the {@link ConnectionService} could chose to
     * ignore some events altogether.
     * <p>
     * Events should be fully qualified (e.g., {@code com.example.event.MY_EVENT}) to avoid
     * conflicts between {@link InCallService} implementations.  Further, {@link InCallService}
     * implementations shall not re-purpose events in the {@code android.*} namespace, nor shall
     * they define their own event types in this namespace.  When defining a custom event type,
     * ensure the contents of the extras {@link Bundle} is clearly defined.  Extra keys for this
     * bundle should be named similar to the event type (e.g. {@code com.example.extra.MY_EXTRA}).
     * <p>
     * When defining events and the associated extras, it is important to keep their behavior
     * consistent when the associated {@link InCallService} is updated.  Support for deprecated
     * events/extras should me maintained to ensure backwards compatibility with older
     * {@link ConnectionService} implementations which were built to support the older behavior.
     *
     * @param event The connection event.
     * @param extras Bundle containing extra information associated with the event.
