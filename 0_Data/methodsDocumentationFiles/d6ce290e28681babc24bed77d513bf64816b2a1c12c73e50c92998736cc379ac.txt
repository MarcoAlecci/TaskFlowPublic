         * <p>Returns the opto-electronic transfer function (OETF) of this color space.
         * The inverse function is the electro-optical transfer function (EOTF) returned
         * by {@link #getEotf()}. These functions are defined to satisfy the following
         * equality for \(x \in [0..1]\):</p>
         *
         * $$OETF(EOTF(x)) = EOTF(OETF(x)) = x$$
         *
         * <p>For RGB colors, this function can be used to convert from linear space
         * to "gamma space" (gamma encoded). The terms gamma space and gamma encoded
         * are frequently used because many OETFs can be closely approximated using
         * a simple power function of the form \(x^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\) (the
         * approximation of the {@link Named#SRGB sRGB} OETF uses \(\gamma=2.2\)
         * for instance).</p>
