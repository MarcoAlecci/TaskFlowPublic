     * Unload a specified nanoApp
     *
     * Note that unloading is asynchronous.  When we return from this method,
     * the nano app (probably) hasn't unloaded yet.  Assuming a return of 0
     * from this method, then the final success/failure for the unload is
     * delivered in a byte string via a call to Callback.onMessageReceipt.
     *
     * TODO(b/30784270): Provide a better success/failure delivery.
     *
     * @param nanoAppHandle handle of the nanoApp to unload
     *
     * @return 0 if the command for unloading was sent to the context hub;
     *         -1 otherwise
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #unloadNanoApp(ContextHubInfo, long)} instead.
