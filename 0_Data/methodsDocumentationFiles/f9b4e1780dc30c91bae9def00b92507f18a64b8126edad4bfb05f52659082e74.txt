     * Called by ConnectivityService to inform this network agent of signal strength thresholds
     * that when crossed should trigger a system wakeup and a NetworkCapabilities update.
     *
     * When the system updates the list of thresholds that should wake up the CPU for a
     * given agent it will call this method on the agent. The agent that implement this
     * should implement it in hardware so as to ensure the CPU will be woken up on breach.
     * Agents are expected to react to a breach by sending an updated NetworkCapabilities
     * object with the appropriate signal strength to sendNetworkCapabilities.
     *
     * The specific units are bearer-dependent. See details on the units and requests in
     * {@link NetworkCapabilities.Builder#setSignalStrength}.
     *
     * @param thresholds the array of thresholds that should trigger wakeups.
