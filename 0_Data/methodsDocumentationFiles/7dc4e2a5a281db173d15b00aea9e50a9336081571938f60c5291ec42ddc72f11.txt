     * Add an {@link ItemDecoration} to this RecyclerView. Item decorations can
     * affect both measurement and drawing of individual item views.
     *
     * <p>Item decorations are ordered. Decorations placed earlier in the list will
     * be run/queried/drawn first for their effects on item views. Padding added to views
     * will be nested; a padding added by an earlier decoration will mean further
     * item decorations in the list will be asked to draw/pad within the previous decoration's
     * given area.</p>
