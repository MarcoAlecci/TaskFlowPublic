         * Sets the set of padding schemes (e.g., {@code PKCS7Padding}, {@code OAEPPadding},
         * {@code PKCS1Padding}, {@code NoPadding}) with which the key can be used when
         * encrypting/decrypting. Attempts to use the key with any other padding scheme will be
         * rejected.
         *
         * <p>This must be specified for keys which are used for encryption/decryption.
         *
         * <p>For RSA private keys used by TLS/SSL servers to authenticate themselves to clients it
         * is usually necessary to authorize the use of no/any padding
         * ({@link KeyProperties#ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE}) and/or PKCS#1 encryption padding
         * ({@link KeyProperties#ENCRYPTION_PADDING_RSA_PKCS1}). This is because RSA decryption is
         * required by some cipher suites, and some stacks request decryption using no padding
         * whereas others request PKCS#1 padding.
         *
         * <p>See {@link KeyProperties}.{@code ENCRYPTION_PADDING} constants.
