     * Execute a single SQL statement that is NOT a SELECT
     * or any other SQL statement that returns data.
     * <p>
     * It has no means to return any data (such as the number of affected rows).
     * Instead, you're encouraged to use {@link #insert(String, String, ContentValues)},
     * {@link #update(String, ContentValues, String, String[])}, et al, when possible.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When using {@link #enableWriteAheadLogging()}, journal_mode is
     * automatically managed by this class. So, do not set journal_mode
     * using "PRAGMA journal_mode'<value>" statement if your app is using
     * {@link #enableWriteAheadLogging()}
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that {@code PRAGMA} values which apply on a per-connection basis
     * should <em>not</em> be configured using this method; you should instead
     * use {@link #execPerConnectionSQL} to ensure that they are uniformly
     * applied to all current and future connections.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param sql the SQL statement to be executed. Multiple statements separated by semicolons are
     * not supported.
     * @throws SQLException if the SQL string is invalid
