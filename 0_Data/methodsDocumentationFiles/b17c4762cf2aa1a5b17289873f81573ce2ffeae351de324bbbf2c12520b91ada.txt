     * Returns whether the view is 'visible' according to the given values
     * object. This is determined by testing the same properties in the values
     * object that are used to determine whether the object is appearing or
     * disappearing in the {@link
     * Transition#createAnimator(ViewGroup, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}
     * method. This method can be called by, for example, subclasses that want
     * to know whether the object is visible in the same way that Visibility
     * determines it for the actual animation.
     *
     * @param values The TransitionValues object that holds the information by
     * which visibility is determined.
     * @return True if the view reference by <code>values</code> is visible,
     * false otherwise.
