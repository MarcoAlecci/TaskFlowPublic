     * Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION} and/or {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION

     * Access will remain until the Activity has finished (it will remain across the hosting
     * process being killed and other temporary destruction) and will be added
     * to any existing set of URI permissions it already holds.
