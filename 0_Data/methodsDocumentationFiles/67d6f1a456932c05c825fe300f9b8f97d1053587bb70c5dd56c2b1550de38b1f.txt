     * Resets the bootable flag on the non-current partition and all internal
     * update_engine state. This can be used after an unwanted payload has been
     * successfully applied and the device has not yet been rebooted to signal
     * that we no longer want to boot into that updated system. After this call
     * completes, update_engine will no longer report
     * {@code UPDATED_NEED_REBOOT}, so your callback can remove any outstanding
     * notification that rebooting into the new system is possible.
