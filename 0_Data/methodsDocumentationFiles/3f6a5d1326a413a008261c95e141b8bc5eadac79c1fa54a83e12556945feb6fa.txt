     * Report web resource loading error to the host application. These errors usually indicate
     * inability to connect to the server. Note that unlike the deprecated version of the callback,
     * the new version will be called for any resource (iframe, image, etc.), not just for the main
     * page. Thus, it is recommended to perform minimum required work in this callback.
     * @param view The WebView that is initiating the callback.
     * @param request The originating request.
     * @param error Information about the error occurred.
