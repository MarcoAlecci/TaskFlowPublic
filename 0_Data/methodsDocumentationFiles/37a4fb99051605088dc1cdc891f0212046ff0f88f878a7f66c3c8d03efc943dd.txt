     * Swaps the active audio stream between the conference's child {@link RemoteConnection}s.
     * This should be invoked only if the conference contains the capability
     * {@link Connection#CAPABILITY_SWAP_CONFERENCE}, otherwise it is a no-op. This is only used by
     * {@link ConnectionService}s that create conferences for connections that do not yet have
     * their audio streams merged; this is a common pattern for CDMA conference calls, but the
     * capability is not used for GSM and SIP conference calls. Invoking this method will change the
     * active audio stream to a different child connection.
