     * System services can implement this method to implement ADB shell commands.
     *
     * <p>A system binder service can implement it to handle shell commands on ADB. For example,
     * the Job Scheduler service implements it to handle <code>adb shell cmd jobscheduler</code>.
     *
     * <p>Commands are only executable by ADB shell; i.e. only {@link Process#SHELL_UID} and
     * {@link Process#ROOT_UID} can call them.
     *
     * @param in standard input
     * @param out standard output
     * @param err standard error
     * @param args arguments passed to the command. Can be empty. The first argument is typically
     *             a subcommand, such as {@code run} for {@code adb shell cmd jobscheduler run}.
     * @return the status code returned from the <code>cmd</code> command.
