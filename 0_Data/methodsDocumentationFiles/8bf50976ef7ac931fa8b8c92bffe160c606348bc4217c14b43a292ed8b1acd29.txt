     * Called when Autofill is requesting an {@link InlineSuggestionsRequest} from the IME.
     *
     * <p>The Autofill Framework will first request the IME to create and send an
     * {@link InlineSuggestionsRequest} back. Once Autofill Framework receives a valid request and
     * also receives valid inline suggestions, they will be returned via
     * {@link #onInlineSuggestionsResponse(InlineSuggestionsResponse)}.</p>
     *
     * <p>IME Lifecycle - The request will wait to be created after inputStarted</p>
     *
     * <p>If the IME wants to support displaying inline suggestions, they must set
     * supportsInlineSuggestions in its XML and implement this method to return a valid
     * {@link InlineSuggestionsRequest}.</p>
     *
     * @param uiExtras the extras that contain the UI renderer related information
     * @return an {@link InlineSuggestionsRequest} to be sent to Autofill.
