     *
     * A client is registered with the Context Hub Service for a specified Context Hub. When the
     * registration succeeds, the client can send messages to nanoapps through the returned
     * {@link ContextHubClient} object, and receive notifications through the provided callback.
     *
     * @param hubInfo  the hub to attach this client to
     * @param callback the notification callback to register
     * @param executor the executor to invoke the callback
     * @return the registered client object
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if hubInfo does not represent a valid hub
     * @throws IllegalStateException    if there were too many registered clients at the service
     * @throws NullPointerException     if callback, hubInfo, or executor is null
