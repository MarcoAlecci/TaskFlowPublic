     * Returns a {@code Collector} that produces the sum of a double-valued
     * function applied to the input elements.  If no elements are present,
     * the result is 0.
     *
     * <p>The sum returned can vary depending upon the order in which
     * values are recorded, due to accumulated rounding error in
     * addition of values of differing magnitudes. Values sorted by increasing
     * absolute magnitude tend to yield more accurate results.  If any recorded
     * value is a {@code NaN} or the sum is at any point a {@code NaN} then the
     * sum will be {@code NaN}.
     *
     * @param <T> the type of the input elements
     * @param mapper a function extracting the property to be summed
     * @return a {@code Collector} that produces the sum of a derived property
