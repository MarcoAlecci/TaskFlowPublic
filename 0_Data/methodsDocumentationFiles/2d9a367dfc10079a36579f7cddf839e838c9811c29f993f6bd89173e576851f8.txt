     * Returns the name of this Transition. This name is used internally to distinguish
     * between different transitions to determine when interrupting transitions overlap.
     * For example, a ChangeBounds running on the same target view as another ChangeBounds
     * should determine whether the old transition is animating to different end values
     * and should be canceled in favor of the new transition.
     *
     * <p>By default, a Transition's name is simply the value of {@link Class#getName()},
     * but subclasses are free to override and return something different.</p>
     *
     * @return The name of this transition.
