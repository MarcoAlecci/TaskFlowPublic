     * applications.
     *
     * <p>If {@link DevicePolicyManager#isLockTaskPermitted(String)} returns {@code true}
     * for this component, the current task will be launched directly into LockTask mode. Only apps
     * whitelisted by {@link DevicePolicyManager#setLockTaskPackages(ComponentName, String[])} can
     * be launched while LockTask mode is active. The user will not be able to leave this mode
     * until this activity calls {@link #stopLockTask()}. Calling this method while the device is
     * already in LockTask mode has no effect.
     *
     * <p>Otherwise, the current task will be launched into screen pinning mode. In this case, the
     * system will prompt the user with a dialog requesting permission to use this mode.
     * The user can exit at any time through instructions shown on the request dialog. Calling
     * {@link #stopLockTask()} will also terminate this mode.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> this method can only be called when the activity is foreground.
     * That is, between {@link #onResume()} and {@link #onPause()}.
