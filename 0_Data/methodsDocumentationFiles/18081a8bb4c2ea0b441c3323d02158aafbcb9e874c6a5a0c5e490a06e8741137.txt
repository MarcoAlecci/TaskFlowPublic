     * Set the RemoteViews to use for the specified appWidgetId.
     * <p>
     * Note that the RemoteViews parameter will be cached by the AppWidgetService, and hence should
     * contain a complete representation of the widget. For performing partial widget updates, see
     * {@link #partiallyUpdateAppWidget(int, RemoteViews)}.
     *
     * <p>
     * It is okay to call this method both inside an {@link #ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE} broadcast,
     * and outside of the handler.
     * This method will only work when called from the uid that owns the AppWidget provider.
     *
     * <p>
     * The total Bitmap memory used by the RemoteViews object cannot exceed that required to
     * fill the screen 1.5 times, ie. (screen width x screen height x 4 x 1.5) bytes.
     *
     * @param appWidgetId      The AppWidget instance for which to set the RemoteViews.
     * @param views         The RemoteViews object to show.
