     * Tries to make a new bitmap based on the dimensions of this bitmap,
     * setting the new bitmap's config to the one specified, and then copying
     * this bitmap's pixels into the new bitmap. If the conversion is not
     * supported, or the allocator fails, then this returns NULL.  The returned
     * bitmap has the same density and color space as the original, except in
     * the following cases. When copying to {@link Config#ALPHA_8}, the color
     * space is dropped. When copying to or from {@link Config#RGBA_F16},
     * EXTENDED or non-EXTENDED variants may be adjusted as appropriate.
     *
     * @param config    The desired config for the resulting bitmap
     * @param isMutable True if the resulting bitmap should be mutable (i.e.
     *                  its pixels can be modified)
     * @return the new bitmap, or null if the copy could not be made.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if config is {@link Config#HARDWARE} and isMutable is true
