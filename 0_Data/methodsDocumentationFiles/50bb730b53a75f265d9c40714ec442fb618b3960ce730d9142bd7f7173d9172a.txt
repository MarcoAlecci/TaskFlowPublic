     * This function is called when an instance or subclass sets the state description. Once this
     * is called and the argument is not null, the app developer will be responsible for updating
     * state description when checked state changes and we will not set state description
     * in {@link #setChecked}. App developers can restore the default behavior by setting the
     * argument to null. If {@link #setChecked} is called first and then setStateDescription is
     * called, two state change events will be merged by event throttling and we can still get
     * the correct state description.
     *
     * @param stateDescription The state description.
