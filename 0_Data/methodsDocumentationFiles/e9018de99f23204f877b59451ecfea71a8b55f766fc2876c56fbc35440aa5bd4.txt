     * Requests a Tuner Descrambler resource.
     *
     * <p>There are three possible scenarios:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If there is Descrambler available, the API would send the handle back.
     *
     * <li>If no Descrambler is available but the current request has a higher priority than other
     * uses of descramblers, the API will send
     * {@link IResourcesReclaimListener#onReclaimResources()} to the {@link Tuner}. Tuner would
     * handle the resource reclaim on the holder of lower priority and notify the holder of its
     * resource loss.
     *
     * <li>If no Descrambler system can be granted, the API would return false.
     * <ul>
     *
     * @param request {@link TunerDescramblerRequest} information of the current request.
     * @param descramblerHandle a one-element array to return the granted Descrambler handle.
     *                          If no Descrambler granted, this will return
     *                          {@link #INVALID_RESOURCE_HANDLE}.
     *
     * @return true if there is Descrambler granted.
