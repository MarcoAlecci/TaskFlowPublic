     * Runs tether provisioning for the given type if needed and then starts tethering if
     * the check succeeds. If no carrier provisioning is required for tethering, tethering is
     * enabled immediately. If provisioning fails, tethering will not be enabled. It also
     * schedules tether provisioning re-checks if appropriate.
     *
     * @param type The type of tethering to start. Must be one of
     *         {@link ConnectivityManager.TETHERING_WIFI},
     *         {@link ConnectivityManager.TETHERING_USB}, or
     *         {@link ConnectivityManager.TETHERING_BLUETOOTH}.
     * @param showProvisioningUi a boolean indicating to show the provisioning app UI if there
     *         is one. This should be true the first time this function is called and also any time
     *         the user can see this UI. It gives users information from their carrier about the
     *         check failing and how they can sign up for tethering if possible.
     * @param callback an {@link OnStartTetheringCallback} which will be called to notify the caller
     *         of the result of trying to tether.
     * @param handler {@link Handler} to specify the thread upon which the callback will be invoked.
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link TetheringManager#startTethering} instead.
