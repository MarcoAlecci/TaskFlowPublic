     * Tells the transport to cancel the currently-ongoing full backup operation.  This
     * will happen between {@link #performFullBackup()} and {@link #finishBackup()}
     * if the OS needs to abort the backup operation for any reason, such as a crash in
     * the application undergoing backup.
     *
     * <p>When it receives this call, the transport should discard any partial archive
     * that it has stored so far.  If possible it should also roll back to the previous
     * known-good archive in its datastore.
     *
     * <p>If the transport receives this callback, it will <em>not</em> receive a
     * call to {@link #finishBackup()}.  It needs to tear down any ongoing backup state
     * here.
