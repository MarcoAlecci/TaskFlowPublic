     * Builds caches associated with the bitmap that are used for drawing it.
     *
     * <p>Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N}, this call initiates an asynchronous
     * upload to the GPU on RenderThread, if the Bitmap is not already uploaded. With Hardware
     * Acceleration, Bitmaps must be uploaded to the GPU in order to be rendered. This is done by
     * default the first time a Bitmap is drawn, but the process can take several milliseconds,
     * depending on the size of the Bitmap. Each time a Bitmap is modified and drawn again, it must
     * be re-uploaded.</p>
     *
     * <p>Calling this method in advance can save time in the first frame it's used. For example, it
     * is recommended to call this on an image decoding worker thread when a decoded Bitmap is about
     * to be displayed. It is recommended to make any pre-draw modifications to the Bitmap before
     * calling this method, so the cached, uploaded copy may be reused without re-uploading.</p>
     *
     * In {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT} and below, for purgeable bitmaps, this call
     * would attempt to ensure that the pixels have been decoded.
