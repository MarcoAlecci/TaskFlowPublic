     * Tells whether or not this encoder can encode the given character.
     *
     * <p> This method returns <tt>false</tt> if the given character is a
     * surrogate character; such characters can be interpreted only when they
     * are members of a pair consisting of a high surrogate followed by a low
     * surrogate.  The {@link #canEncode(java.lang.CharSequence)
     * canEncode(CharSequence)} method may be used to test whether or not a
     * character sequence can be encoded.
     *
     * <p> This method may modify this encoder's state; it should therefore not
     * be invoked if an <a href="#steps">encoding operation</a> is already in
     * progress.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method is not very efficient; it
     * should generally be overridden to improve performance.  </p>
