     * Indicates if the codepoint is a mid-word-only punctuation.
     *
     * At the moment, this is locale-independent, and includes all the characters in
     * the MidLetter, MidNumLet, and Single_Quote class of Unicode word breaking algorithm (see
     * UAX #29 "Unicode Text Segmentation" at http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/). These are all the
     * characters that according to the rules WB6 and WB7 of UAX #29 prevent word breaks if they are
     * in the middle of a word, but they become word breaks if they happen at the end of a word
     * (accroding to rule WB999 that breaks word in any place that is not prohibited otherwise).
     *
     * @param locale the locale to consider the codepoint in. Presently ignored.
     * @param codePoint the codepoint to check.
     * @return True if the codepoint is a mid-word punctuation.
