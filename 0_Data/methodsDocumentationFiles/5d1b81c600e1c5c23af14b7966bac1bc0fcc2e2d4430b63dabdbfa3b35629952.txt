     * Convenience method for sending a {@link AccessibilityEvent#TYPE_ANNOUNCEMENT}
     * {@link AccessibilityEvent} to suggest that an accessibility service announce the
     * specified text to its users.
     * <p>
     * Note: The event generated with this API carries no semantic meaning, and is appropriate only
     * in exceptional situations. Apps can generally achieve correct behavior for accessibility by
     * accurately supplying the semantics of their UI.
     * They should not need to specify what exactly is announced to users.
     *
     * @param text The announcement text.
