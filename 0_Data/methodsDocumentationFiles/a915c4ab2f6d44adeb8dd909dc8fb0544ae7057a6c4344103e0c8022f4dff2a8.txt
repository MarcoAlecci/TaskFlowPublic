     * Mark if this Bundle is okay to "defuse." That is, it's okay for system
     * processes to ignore any {@link BadParcelableException} encountered when
     * unparceling it, leaving an empty bundle in its place.
     * <p>
     * This should <em>only</em> be set when the Bundle reaches its final
     * destination, otherwise a system process may clobber contents that were
     * destined for an app that could have unparceled them.
