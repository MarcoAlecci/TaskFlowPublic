     * Set the locale list to a list of just one locale. This will also set the layout direction
     * according to the locale.
     *
     * Note that after this is run, calling <code>.equals()</code> on the input locale and the
     * {@link #locale} attribute would return <code>true</code> if they are not null, but there is
     * no guarantee that they would be the same object.
     *
     * See also the note about layout direction in {@link #setLocales(LocaleList)}.
     *
     * @param loc The locale. Can be null.
