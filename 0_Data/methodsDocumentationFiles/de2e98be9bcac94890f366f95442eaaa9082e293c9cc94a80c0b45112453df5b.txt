     * If this activity is being destroyed because it can not handle a
     * configuration parameter being changed (and thus its
     * {@link #onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)} method is
     * <em>not</em> being called), then you can use this method to discover
     * the set of changes that have occurred while in the process of being
     * destroyed.  Note that there is no guarantee that these will be
     * accurate (other changes could have happened at any time), so you should
     * only use this as an optimization hint.
     *
     * @return Returns a bit field of the configuration parameters that are
     * changing, as defined by the {@link android.content.res.Configuration}
     * class.
