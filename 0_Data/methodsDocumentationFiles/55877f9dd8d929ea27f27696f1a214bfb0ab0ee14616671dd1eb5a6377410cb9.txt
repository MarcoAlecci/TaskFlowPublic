     * Sets the Audio Description mix level in dB.
     *
     * For AudioTracks incorporating a secondary Audio Description stream
     * (where such contents may be sent through an Encapsulation Mode
     * other than {@link #ENCAPSULATION_MODE_NONE}).
     * or internally by a HW channel),
     * the level of mixing of the Audio Description to the Main Audio stream
     * is controlled by this method.
     *
     * Such mixing occurs <strong>prior</strong> to overall volume scaling.
     *
     * @param level a floating point value between
     *     {@code Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY} to {@code +48.f},
     *     where {@code Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY} means the Audio Description is not mixed
     *     and a level of {@code 0.f} means the Audio Description is mixed without scaling.
     * @return true on success, false on failure.
