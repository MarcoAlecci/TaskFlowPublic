     * Performs a logical <b>XOR</b> of this bit set with the bit set
     * argument. This bit set is modified so that a bit in it has the
     * value {@code true} if and only if one of the following
     * statements holds:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The bit initially has the value {@code true}, and the
     *     corresponding bit in the argument has the value {@code false}.
     * <li>The bit initially has the value {@code false}, and the
     *     corresponding bit in the argument has the value {@code true}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param  set a bit set
