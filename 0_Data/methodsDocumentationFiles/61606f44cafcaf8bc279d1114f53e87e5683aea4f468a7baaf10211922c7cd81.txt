     * Schedule an alarm to be delivered within a given window of time.  This method
     * is similar to {@link #set(int, long, PendingIntent)}, but allows the
     * application to precisely control the degree to which its delivery might be
     * adjusted by the OS. This method allows an application to take advantage of the
     * battery optimizations that arise from delivery batching even when it has
     * modest timeliness requirements for its alarms.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method can also be used to achieve strict ordering guarantees among
     * multiple alarms by ensuring that the windows requested for each alarm do
     * not intersect.
     *
     * <p>
     * When precise delivery is not required, applications should use the standard
     * {@link #set(int, long, PendingIntent)} method.  This will give the OS the most
     * flexibility to minimize wakeups and battery use.  For alarms that must be delivered
     * at precisely-specified times with no acceptable variation, applications can use
     * {@link #setExact(int, long, PendingIntent)}.
     *
     * @param type type of alarm.
     * @param windowStartMillis The earliest time, in milliseconds, that the alarm should
     *        be delivered, expressed in the appropriate clock's units (depending on the alarm
     *        type).
     * @param windowLengthMillis The length of the requested delivery window,
     *        in milliseconds.  The alarm will be delivered no later than this many
     *        milliseconds after {@code windowStartMillis}.  Note that this parameter
     *        is a <i>duration,</i> not the timestamp of the end of the window.
     * @param operation Action to perform when the alarm goes off;
     *        typically comes from {@link PendingIntent#getBroadcast
     *        IntentSender.getBroadcast()}.
