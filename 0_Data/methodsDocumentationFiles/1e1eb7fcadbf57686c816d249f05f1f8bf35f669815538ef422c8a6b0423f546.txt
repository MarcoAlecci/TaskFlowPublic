     * <p>Get a {@link Surface} that can be used to produce {@link Image Images} for this
     * {@code ImageReader}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Until valid image data is rendered into this {@link Surface}, the
     * {@link #acquireNextImage} method will return {@code null}. Only one source
     * can be producing data into this Surface at the same time, although the
     * same {@link Surface} can be reused with a different API once the first source is
     * disconnected from the {@link Surface}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Please note that holding on to the Surface object returned by this method is not enough
     * to keep its parent ImageReader from being reclaimed. In that sense, a Surface acts like a
     * {@link java.lang.ref.WeakReference weak reference} to the ImageReader that provides it.</p>
     *
     * @return A {@link Surface} to use for a drawing target for various APIs.
