     * Launch a new activity.  You will not receive any information about when
     * the activity exits.  This implementation overrides the base version,
     * providing information about
     * the activity performing the launch.  Because of this additional
     * information, the {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} launch flag is not
     * required; if not specified, the new activity will be added to the
     * task of the caller.
     *
     * <p>This method throws {@link android.content.ActivityNotFoundException}
     * if there was no Activity found to run the given Intent.
     *
     * @param intent The intent to start.
     * @param options Additional options for how the Activity should be started.
     * See {@link android.content.Context#startActivity(Intent, Bundle)}
     * Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.
