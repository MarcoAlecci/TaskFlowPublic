     * Copies the text of the field at the specified row and column index into
     * a {@link CharArrayBuffer}.
     * <p>
     * The buffer is populated as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the buffer is too small for the value to be copied, then it is
     * automatically resized.</li>
     * <li>If the field is of type {@link Cursor#FIELD_TYPE_NULL}, then the buffer
     * is set to an empty string.</li>
     * <li>If the field is of type {@link Cursor#FIELD_TYPE_STRING}, then the buffer
     * is set to the contents of the string.</li>
     * <li>If the field is of type {@link Cursor#FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER}, then the buffer
     * is set to a string representation of the integer in decimal, obtained by formatting the
     * value with the <code>printf</code> family of functions using
     * format specifier <code>%lld</code>.</li>
     * <li>If the field is of type {@link Cursor#FIELD_TYPE_FLOAT}, then the buffer is
     * set to a string representation of the floating-point value in decimal, obtained by
     * formatting the value with the <code>printf</code> family of functions using
     * format specifier <code>%g</code>.</li>
     * <li>If the field is of type {@link Cursor#FIELD_TYPE_BLOB}, then a

     * @param row The zero-based row index.
     * @param column The zero-based column index.
     * @param buffer The {@link CharArrayBuffer} to hold the string.  It is automatically
     * resized if the requested string is larger than the buffer's current capacity.
