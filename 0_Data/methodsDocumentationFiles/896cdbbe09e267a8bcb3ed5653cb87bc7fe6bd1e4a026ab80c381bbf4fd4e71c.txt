     * Registers to receive notifications about changes in the system default network. The callbacks
     * will continue to be called until either the application exits or
     * {@link #unregisterNetworkCallback(NetworkCallback)} is called.
     *
     * <p>To avoid performance issues due to apps leaking callbacks, the system will limit the
     * number of outstanding requests to 100 per app (identified by their UID), shared with
     * all variants of this method, of {@link #requestNetwork} as well as
     * {@link ConnectivityDiagnosticsManager#registerConnectivityDiagnosticsCallback}.
     * Requesting a network with this method will count toward this limit. If this limit is
     * exceeded, an exception will be thrown. To avoid hitting this issue and to conserve resources,
     * make sure to unregister the callbacks with
     * {@link #unregisterNetworkCallback(NetworkCallback)}.
     *
     * @param networkCallback The {@link NetworkCallback} that the system will call as the
     *                        system default network changes.
     * @param handler {@link Handler} to specify the thread upon which the callback will be invoked.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the app already has too many callbacks registered.
