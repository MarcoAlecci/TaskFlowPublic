         * Wraps a Runnable such that this method immediately acquires the wake lock and then
         * once the Runnable is done the wake lock is released.
         *
         * <p>Example:
         *
         * <pre>
         * mHandler.post(mWakeLock.wrap(() -> {
         *     // do things on handler, lock is held while we're waiting for this
         *     // to get scheduled and until the runnable is done executing.
         * });
         * </pre>
         *
         * <p>Note: you must make sure that the Runnable eventually gets executed, otherwise you'll
         *    leak the wakelock!
         *
         * @hide
