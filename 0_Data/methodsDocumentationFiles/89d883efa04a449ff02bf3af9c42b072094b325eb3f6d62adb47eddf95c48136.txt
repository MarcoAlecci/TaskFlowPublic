     * Create an ActivityOptions to transition between Activities using cross-Activity scene
     * animations. This method carries the position of multiple shared elements to the started
     * Activity. The position of the first element in sharedElements
     * will be used as the epicenter for the exit Transition. The position of the associated
     * shared element in the launched Activity will be the epicenter of its entering Transition.
     *
     * <p>This requires {@link android.view.Window#FEATURE_ACTIVITY_TRANSITIONS} to be
     * enabled on the calling Activity to cause an exit transition. The same must be in
     * the called Activity to get an entering transition.</p>
     * @param activity The Activity whose window contains the shared elements.
     * @param sharedElements The names of the shared elements to transfer to the called
     *                       Activity and their associated Views. The Views must each have
     *                       a unique shared element name.
     * @return Returns a new ActivityOptions object that you can use to
     *         supply these options as the options Bundle when starting an activity.
     * @see android.transition.Transition#setEpicenterCallback(
     *          android.transition.Transition.EpicenterCallback)
