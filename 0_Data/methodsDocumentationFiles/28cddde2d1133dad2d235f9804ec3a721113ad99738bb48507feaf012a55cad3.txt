     * Send raw NFC-F commands to the tag and receive the response.
     *
     * <p>Applications must not prefix the SoD (preamble and sync code)
     * and/or append the EoD (CRC) to the payload, it will be automatically calculated.
     *
     * <p>A typical NFC-F frame for this method looks like:
     * <pre>
     * LENGTH (1 byte) --- CMD (1 byte) -- IDm (8 bytes) -- PARAMS (LENGTH - 10 bytes)
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Use {@link #getMaxTransceiveLength} to retrieve the maximum amount of bytes
     * that can be sent with {@link #transceive}.
     *
     * <p>This is an I/O operation and will block until complete. It must
     * not be called from the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
     * {@link IOException} if {@link #close} is called from another thread.
     *
     * <p class="note">Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#NFC} permission.
     *
     * @param data bytes to send
     * @return bytes received in response
     * @throws TagLostException if the tag leaves the field
     * @throws IOException if there is an I/O failure, or this operation is canceled
