     * Returns the list of cipher suites which are enabled by default.
     * Unless a different list is enabled, handshaking on an SSL connection
     * will use one of these cipher suites.  The minimum quality of service
     * for these defaults requires confidentiality protection and server
     * authentication (that is, no anonymous cipher suites).
