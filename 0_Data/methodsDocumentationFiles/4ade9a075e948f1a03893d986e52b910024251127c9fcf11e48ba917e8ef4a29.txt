     * Adds an external subtitle source file (from the provided input stream.)
     *
     * Note that a single external subtitle source may contain multiple or no
     * supported tracks in it. If the source contained at least one track in
     * it, one will receive an {@link MediaPlayer#MEDIA_INFO_METADATA_UPDATE}
     * info message. Otherwise, if reading the source takes excessive time,
     * one will receive a {@link MediaPlayer#MEDIA_INFO_SUBTITLE_TIMED_OUT}
     * message. If the source contained no supported track (including an empty
     * source file or null input stream), one will receive a {@link
     * MediaPlayer#MEDIA_INFO_UNSUPPORTED_SUBTITLE} message. One can find the
     * total number of available tracks using {@link MediaPlayer#getTrackInfo()}
     * to see what additional tracks become available after this method call.
     *
     * @param is     input stream containing the subtitle data.  It will be
     *               closed by the media framework.
     * @param format the format of the subtitle track(s).  Must contain at least
     *               the mime type ({@link MediaFormat#KEY_MIME}) and the
     *               language ({@link MediaFormat#KEY_LANGUAGE}) of the file.
     *               If the file itself contains the language information,
     *               specify "und" for the language.
