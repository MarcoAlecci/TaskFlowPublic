     * Retrieve all preferred activities, previously added with
     * {@link #addPreferredActivity}, that are
     * currently registered with the system.
     *
     * @param outFilters A required list in which to place the filters of all of the
     * preferred activities.
     * @param outActivities A required list in which to place the component names of
     * all of the preferred activities.
     * @param packageName An optional package in which you would like to limit
     * the list.  If null, all activities will be returned; if non-null, only
     * those activities in the given package are returned.
     *
     * @return Returns the total number of registered preferred activities
     * (the number of distinct IntentFilter records, not the number of unique
     * activity components) that were found.
     *
     * @deprecated This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
     * responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
     * directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
     * {@link #resolveActivity} or {@link #queryIntentActivities}. To configure
     * an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
     * holders, see {@link android.app.role.RoleManager}.
