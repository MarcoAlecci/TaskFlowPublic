     * Writes the audio data to the audio sink for playback (streaming mode),
     * or copies audio data for later playback (static buffer mode).
     * The format specified in the AudioTrack constructor should be
     * {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_FLOAT} to correspond to the data in the array.
     * <p>
     * In streaming mode, the blocking behavior depends on the write mode.  If the write mode is
     * {@link #WRITE_BLOCKING}, the write will normally block until all the data has been enqueued
     * for playback, and will return a full transfer count.  However, if the write mode is
     * {@link #WRITE_NON_BLOCKING}, or the track is stopped or paused on entry, or another thread
     * interrupts the write by calling stop or pause, or an I/O error
     * occurs during the write, then the write may return a short transfer count.
     * <p>
     * In static buffer mode, copies the data to the buffer starting at offset 0,
     * and the write mode is ignored.
     * Note that the actual playback of this data might occur after this function returns.
     *
     * @param audioData the array that holds the data to write.
     *     The implementation does not clip for sample values within the nominal range
     *     [-1.0f, 1.0f], provided that all gains in the audio pipeline are
     *     less than or equal to unity (1.0f), and in the absence of post-processing effects
     *     that could add energy, such as reverb.  For the convenience of applications
     *     that compute samples using filters with non-unity gain,
     *     sample values +3 dB beyond the nominal range are permitted.
     *     However such values may eventually be limited or clipped, depending on various gains
     *     and later processing in the audio path.  Therefore applications are encouraged
     *     to provide samples values within the nominal range.
     * @param offsetInFloats the offset, expressed as a number of floats,
     *     in audioData where the data to write starts.
     *    Must not be negative, or cause the data access to go out of bounds of the array.
     * @param sizeInFloats the number of floats to write in audioData after the offset.
     *    Must not be negative, or cause the data access to go out of bounds of the array.
     * @param writeMode one of {@link #WRITE_BLOCKING}, {@link #WRITE_NON_BLOCKING}. It has no
     *     effect in static mode.
     *     <br>With {@link #WRITE_BLOCKING}, the write will block until all data has been written
     *         to the audio sink.
     *     <br>With {@link #WRITE_NON_BLOCKING}, the write will return immediately after
     *     queuing as much audio data for playback as possible without blocking.
     * @return zero or the positive number of floats that were written, or one of the following
     *    error codes. The number of floats will be a multiple of the channel count not to
     *    exceed sizeInFloats.
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION} if the track isn't properly initialized</li>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR_BAD_VALUE} if the parameters don't resolve to valid data and indexes</li>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR_DEAD_OBJECT} if the AudioTrack is not valid anymore and
     *    needs to be recreated. The dead object error code is not returned if some data was
     *    successfully transferred. In this case, the error is returned at the next write()</li>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR} in case of other error</li>
     * </ul>
