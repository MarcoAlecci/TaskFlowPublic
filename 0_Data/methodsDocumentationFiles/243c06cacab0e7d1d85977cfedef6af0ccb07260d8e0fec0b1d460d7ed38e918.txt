     * Return the approximate per-application memory class of the current
     * device.  This gives you an idea of how hard a memory limit you should
     * impose on your application to let the overall system work best.  The
     * returned value is in megabytes; the baseline Android memory class is
     * 16 (which happens to be the Java heap limit of those devices); some
     * devices with more memory may return 24 or even higher numbers.
