     * Returns "true" if the device is running in Test Harness Mode.
     *
     * <p>Test Harness Mode is a feature that allows devices to run without human interaction in a
     * device farm/testing harness (such as Firebase Test Lab). You should check this method if you
     * want your app to behave differently when running in a test harness to skip setup screens that
     * would impede UI testing. e.g. a keyboard application that has a full screen setup page for
     * the first time it is launched.
     *
     * <p>Note that you should <em>not</em> use this to determine whether or not your app is running
     * an instrumentation test, as it is not set for a standard device running a test.
