     *  Specify whether the {@link Bitmap} should have unpremultiplied pixels.
     *
     *  By default, ImageDecoder will create a {@link Bitmap} with
     *  premultiplied pixels, which is required for drawing with the
     *  {@link android.view.View} system (i.e. to a {@link Canvas}). Calling
     *  this method with a value of {@code true} will result in
     *  {@link #decodeBitmap} returning a {@link Bitmap} with unpremultiplied
     *  pixels. See {@link Bitmap#isPremultiplied}. This is incompatible with
     *  {@link #decodeDrawable}; attempting to decode an unpremultiplied
     *  {@link Drawable} will throw an {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}.
