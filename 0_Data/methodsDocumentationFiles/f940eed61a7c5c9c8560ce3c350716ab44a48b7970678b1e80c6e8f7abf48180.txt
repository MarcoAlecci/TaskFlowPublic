         * An effect layer behaves like a container layer by default but it can support
         * color fill, shadows and/or blur. These layers will not have an associated buffer.
         * When created, this layer has no effects set and will be transparent but the caller
         * can render an effect by calling:
         *  - {@link Transaction#setColor(SurfaceControl, float[])}
         *  - {@link Transaction#setBackgroundBlurRadius(SurfaceControl, int)}
         *  - {@link Transaction#setShadowRadius(SurfaceControl, float)}
         *
         * @hide
