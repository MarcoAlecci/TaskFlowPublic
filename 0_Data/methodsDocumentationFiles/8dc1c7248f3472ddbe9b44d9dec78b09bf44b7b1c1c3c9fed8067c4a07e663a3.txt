 Returns true if the bitmap's config supports per-pixel alpha, and
     * if the pixels may contain non-opaque alpha values. For some configs,
     * this is always false (e.g. RGB_565), since they do not support per-pixel
     * alpha. However, for configs that do, the bitmap may be flagged to be
     * known that all of its pixels are opaque. In this case hasAlpha() will
     * also return false. If a config such as ARGB_8888 is not so flagged,
     * it will return true by default.
