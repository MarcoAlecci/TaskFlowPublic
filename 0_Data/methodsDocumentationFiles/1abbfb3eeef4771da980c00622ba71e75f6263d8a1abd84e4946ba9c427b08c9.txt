     * Compares the specified object with this map for equality.  Returns
     * <tt>true</tt> if the given object is also a map and the two maps
     * represent identical object-reference mappings.  More formally, this
     * map is equal to another map <tt>m</tt> if and only if
     * <tt>this.entrySet().equals(m.entrySet())</tt>.
     *
     * <p><b>Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of this map it is
     * possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of the
     * <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract may be violated if this map is compared
     * to a normal map.  However, the <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract is
     * guaranteed to hold among <tt>IdentityHashMap</tt> instances.</b>
