     * A filter uses demux as data source by default. If the data was packetized
     * by multiple protocols, multiple filters may need to work together to
     * extract all protocols' header. Then a filter's data source can be output
     * from another filter.
     *
     * @param source the filter instance which provides data input. Switch to
     * use demux as data source if the filter instance is NULL.
     * @return result status of the operation.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the data source has been set.
