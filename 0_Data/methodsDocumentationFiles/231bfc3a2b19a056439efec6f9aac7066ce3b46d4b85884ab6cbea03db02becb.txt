     * Copies the data for an object from a file descriptor.
     * This call may block for an arbitrary amount of time depending on the size
     * of the data and speed of the devices. The file descriptor is not closed
     * on completion, and must be done by the caller.
     *
     * @param objectHandle handle of the target file
     * @param size size of the file in bytes
     * @param descriptor file descriptor to read the data from.
