     * Checks whether a given package in a UID and PID has a given permission
     * and whether the app op that corresponds to this permission is allowed.
     *
     * <strong>NOTE:</strong> Use this method only for permission checks at the
     * preflight point where you will not deliver the permission protected data
     * to clients but schedule permission data delivery, apps register listeners,
     * etc.
     *
     * <p>For example, if an app registers a location listener it should have the location
     * permission but no data is actually sent to the app at the moment of registration
     * and you should use this method to determine if the app has or may have location
     * permission (if app has only foreground location the grant state depends on the app's
     * fg/gb state) and this check will not leave a trace that permission protected data
     * was delivered. When you are about to deliver the location data to a registered
     * listener you should use {@link #checkPermissionForDataDelivery(Context, String,
     * int, int, String, String)} which will evaluate the permission access based on the current
     * fg/bg state of the app and leave a record that the data was accessed.
     *
     * @param context Context for accessing resources.
     * @param permission The permission to check.
     * @param pid The process id for which to check.
     * @param uid The uid for which to check.
     * @param packageName The package name for which to check. If null the
     *     the first package for the calling UID will be used.
     * @return The permission check result which is either {@link #PERMISSION_GRANTED}
     *     or {@link #PERMISSION_SOFT_DENIED} or {@link #PERMISSION_HARD_DENIED}.
