     * Retrieve a unique token identifying the top-level "real" window of
     * the window that this view is attached to.  That is, this is like
     * {@link #getWindowToken}, except if the window this view in is a panel
     * window (attached to another containing window), then the token of
     * the containing window is returned instead.
     *
     * @return Returns the associated window token, either
     * {@link #getWindowToken()} or the containing window's token.
