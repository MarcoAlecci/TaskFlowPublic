     * Determine if two intents are the same for the purposes of intent
     * resolution (filtering). That is, if their action, data, type, identity,
     * class, and categories are the same.  This does <em>not</em> compare
     * any extra data included in the intents.  Note that technically when actually
     * matching against an {@link IntentFilter} the identifier is ignored, while here
     * it is directly compared for equality like the other fields.
     *
     * @param other The other Intent to compare against.
     *
     * @return Returns true if action, data, type, class, and categories
     *         are the same.
