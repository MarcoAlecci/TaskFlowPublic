     * Sets the playback head position within the static buffer.
     * The track must be stopped or paused for the position to be changed,
     * and must use the {@link #MODE_STATIC} mode.
     * @param positionInFrames playback head position within buffer, expressed in frames.
     * Zero corresponds to start of buffer.
     * The position must not be greater than the buffer size in frames, or negative.
     * Though this method and {@link #getPlaybackHeadPosition()} have similar names,
     * the position values have different meanings.
     * <br>
     * If looping is currently enabled and the new position is greater than or equal to the
     * loop end marker, the behavior varies by API level:
     * as of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M},
     * the looping is first disabled and then the position is set.
     * For earlier API levels, the behavior is unspecified.
     * @return error code or success, see {@link #SUCCESS}, {@link #ERROR_BAD_VALUE},
     *    {@link #ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION}
