     * Returns a {@code BigInteger} whose value is {@code this << n}. The
     * result is equivalent to {@code this * pow(2, n)} if n >= 0. The shift
     * distance may be negative which means that {@code this} is shifted right.
     * The result then corresponds to {@code floor(this / pow(2, -n))}.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Note:</b> Usage of this method on negative values is
     * not recommended as the current implementation is not efficient.
     *
     * @param n shift distance.
     * @return {@code this << n} if {@code n >= 0}; {@code this >> (-n)}.
     *     otherwise
