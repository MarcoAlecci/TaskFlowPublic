     * <p>Change the indeterminate mode for this progress bar. In indeterminate
     * mode, the progress is ignored and the progress bar shows an infinite
     * animation instead.</p>
     *
     * If this progress bar's style only supports indeterminate mode (such as the circular
     * progress bars), then this will be ignored.
     *
     * @param indeterminate true to enable the indeterminate mode
