     * The MmTelFeature should override this method to handle the enabling/disabling of
     * MmTel Features, defined in {@link MmTelCapabilities.MmTelCapability}. The framework assumes
     * the {@link CapabilityChangeRequest} was processed successfully. If a subset of capabilities
     * could not be set to their new values,
     * {@link CapabilityCallbackProxy#onChangeCapabilityConfigurationError} must be called
     * individually for each capability whose processing resulted in an error.
     *
     * Enabling/Disabling a capability here indicates that the capability should be registered or
     * deregistered (depending on the capability change) and become available or unavailable to
     * the framework.
