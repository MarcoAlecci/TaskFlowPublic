     * of the activity below it changes.
     *
     * This call may be a consequence of {@link #requestVisibleBehind(boolean)} or might be
     * due to a background activity finishing itself.
     *
     * @deprecated This method's functionality is no longer supported as of
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O} and will be removed in a future release.

     * @param visible true if a background activity is visible, false otherwise.
