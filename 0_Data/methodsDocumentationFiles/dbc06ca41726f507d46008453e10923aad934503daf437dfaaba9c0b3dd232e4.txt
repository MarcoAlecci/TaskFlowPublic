     *
     * @param divisor
     *            value by which {@code this} is divided.
     * @return integral part of {@code this / divisor}.
     * @throws NullPointerException
     *             if {@code divisor == null}.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code divisor == 0}.
