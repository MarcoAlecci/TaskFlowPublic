     * Allows a package listening to the
     * {@link Intent#ACTION_PACKAGE_NEEDS_VERIFICATION package verification
     * broadcast} to extend the default timeout for a response and declare what
     * action to perform after the timeout occurs. The response must include
     * the {@code verificationCodeAtTimeout} which is one of
     * {@link PackageManager#VERIFICATION_ALLOW} or
     * {@link PackageManager#VERIFICATION_REJECT}.
     *
     * This method may only be called once per package id. Additional calls
     * will have no effect.
     *
     * @param id pending package identifier as passed via the
     *            {@link PackageManager#EXTRA_VERIFICATION_ID} Intent extra.
     * @param verificationCodeAtTimeout either
     *            {@link PackageManager#VERIFICATION_ALLOW} or
     *            {@link PackageManager#VERIFICATION_REJECT}. If
     *            {@code verificationCodeAtTimeout} is neither
     *            {@link PackageManager#VERIFICATION_ALLOW} or
     *            {@link PackageManager#VERIFICATION_REJECT}, then
     *            {@code verificationCodeAtTimeout} will default to
     *            {@link PackageManager#VERIFICATION_REJECT}.
     * @param millisecondsToDelay the amount of time requested for the timeout.
     *            Must be positive and less than
     *            {@link PackageManager#MAXIMUM_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT}. If
     *            {@code millisecondsToDelay} is out of bounds,
     *            {@code millisecondsToDelay} will be set to the closest in
     *            bounds value; namely, 0 or
     *            {@link PackageManager#MAXIMUM_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT}.
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller does not have the
     *            PACKAGE_VERIFICATION_AGENT permission.
