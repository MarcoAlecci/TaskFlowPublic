     * Causes the {@link #loop} method to terminate as soon as all remaining messages
     * in the message queue that are already due to be delivered have been handled.
     * However pending delayed messages with due times in the future will not be
     * delivered before the loop terminates.

     * Any attempt to post messages to the queue after the looper is asked to quit will fail.
     * For example, the {@link Handler#sendMessage(Message)} method will return false.
