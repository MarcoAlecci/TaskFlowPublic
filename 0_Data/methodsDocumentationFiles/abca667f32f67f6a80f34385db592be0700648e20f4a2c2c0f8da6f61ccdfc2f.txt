     * Converts an integer to a series of bytes with base 256 and the most significant digit first.
     * The first byte's highest bit is used for sign. If the most significant digit is larger than
     * 127, an extra byte (0) will be prepended before it. This method currently doesn't support
     * negative values.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If {@code value} is negative.
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException If {@code offset} exceeds the bounds of {@code dest}.
