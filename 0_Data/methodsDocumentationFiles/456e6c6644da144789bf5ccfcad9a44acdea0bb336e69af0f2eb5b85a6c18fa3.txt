     * Adds the transitionName of a target view that this Transition is interested in
     * animating. By default, there are no targetNames, and a Transition will
     * listen for changes on every view in the hierarchy below the sceneRoot
     * of the Scene being transitioned into. Setting targetNames constrains
     * the Transition to only listen for, and act on, views with these transitionNames.
     * Views with different transitionNames, or no transitionName whatsoever, will be ignored.
     *
     * <p>Note that transitionNames should be unique within the view hierarchy.</p>
     *
     * @see android.view.View#getTransitionName()
     * @param targetName The transitionName of a target view, must be non-null.
     * @return The Transition to which the target transitionName is added.
     * Returning the same object makes it easier to chain calls during
     * construction, such as
     * <code>transitionSet.addTransitions(new Fade()).addTarget(someName);</code>
