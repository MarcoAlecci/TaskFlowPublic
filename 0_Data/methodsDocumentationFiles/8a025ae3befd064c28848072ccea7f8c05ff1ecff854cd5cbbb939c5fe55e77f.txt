     * This is called when the user has performed a cursor movement in the
     * extracted text view, when it is running in fullscreen mode.  The default
     * implementation hides the candidates view when a vertical movement
     * happens, but only if the extracted text editor has a vertical scroll bar
     * because its text doesn't fit.
     * Re-implement this to provide whatever behavior you want.
     * @param dx The amount of cursor movement in the x dimension.
     * @param dy The amount of cursor movement in the y dimension.
