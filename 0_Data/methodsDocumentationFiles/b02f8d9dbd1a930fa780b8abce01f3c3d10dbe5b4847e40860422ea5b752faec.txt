     * Request scoring for networks.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note: The results (i.e scores) for these networks, when available will be provided via the
     * callback registered with {@link #registerNetworkScoreCallback(int, int, Executor,
     * NetworkScoreCallback)}. The calling module is responsible for registering a callback to
     * receive the results before requesting new scores via this API.
     *
     * @return true if the request was successfully sent, or false if there is no active scorer.
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller does not hold the
     *         {@link permission#REQUEST_NETWORK_SCORES} permission.
