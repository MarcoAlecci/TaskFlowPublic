         * This method is called every time the session has no more capture requests to process.
         *
         * <p>During the creation of a new session, this callback is invoked right after
         * {@link #onConfigured} if no capture requests were submitted to the session prior to it
         * completing configuration.</p>
         *
         * <p>Otherwise, this callback will be invoked any time the session finishes processing
         * all of its active capture requests, and no repeating request or burst is set up.</p>
         *
         * @param session the session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
