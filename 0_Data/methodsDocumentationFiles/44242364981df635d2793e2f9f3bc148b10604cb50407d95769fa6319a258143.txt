     * Notify the framework that the device is disconnected from the IMS network.
     * <p>
     * Note: Prior to calling {@link #onDeregistered(ImsReasonInfo)}, you should ensure that any
     * changes to {@link android.telephony.ims.feature.ImsFeature} capability availability is sent
     * to the framework.  For example,
     * {@link android.telephony.ims.feature.MmTelFeature.MmTelCapabilities#CAPABILITY_TYPE_VIDEO}
     * and
     * {@link android.telephony.ims.feature.MmTelFeature.MmTelCapabilities#CAPABILITY_TYPE_VOICE}
     * may be set to unavailable to ensure the framework knows these services are no longer
     * available due to de-registration.  If you do not report capability changes impacted by
     * de-registration, the framework will not know which features are no longer available as a
     * result.
     *
     * @param info the {@link ImsReasonInfo} associated with why registration was disconnected.
