     * Map a {@link HardwareBuffer} object into {@link Image}, so that the content of the buffer is
     * accessible. Depending on the usage and pixel format of the hardware buffer, it may not be
     * mappable; this method returns null in that case.
     *
     * @param hardwareBuffer {@link HardwareBuffer} to map.
     * @return Mapped {@link Image} object, or null if the buffer is not mappable.
