     * Changes this drawable to use a single color state list instead of a
     * gradient. Calling this method with a null argument will clear the color
     * and is equivalent to calling {@link #setColor(int)} with the argument
     * {@link Color#TRANSPARENT}.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note</strong>: changing color will affect all instances of a
     * drawable loaded from a resource. It is recommended to invoke
     * {@link #mutate()} before changing the color.</p>
