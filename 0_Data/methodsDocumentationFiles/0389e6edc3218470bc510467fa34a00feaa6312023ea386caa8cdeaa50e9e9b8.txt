     * Gets the data model backed by the contents of the provided file with historical data.
     * Note that only one data model is backed by a given file, thus multiple calls with
     * the same file name will return the same model instance. If no such instance is present
     * it is created.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> To use the default historical data file clients should explicitly
     * pass as file name {@link #DEFAULT_HISTORY_FILE_NAME}. If no persistence of the choice
     * history is desired clients should pass <code>null</code> for the file name. In such
     * case a new model is returned for each invocation.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Always use difference historical data files for semantically different actions.
     * For example, sharing is different from importing.</strong>

     * @param context Context for loading resources.
     * @param historyFileName File name with choice history, <code>null</code>
     *        if the model should not be backed by a file. In this case the activities
     *        will be ordered only by data from the current session.

     * @return The model.
