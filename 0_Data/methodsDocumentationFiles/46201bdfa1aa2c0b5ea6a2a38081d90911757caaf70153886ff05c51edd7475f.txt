     * Callback indicating the result of a characteristic write operation.
     *
     * <p>If this callback is invoked while a reliable write transaction is
     * in progress, the value of the characteristic represents the value
     * reported by the remote device. An application should compare this
     * value to the desired value to be written. If the values don't match,
     * the application must abort the reliable write transaction.
     *
     * @param gatt GATT client invoked {@link BluetoothGatt#writeCharacteristic}
     * @param characteristic Characteristic that was written to the associated remote device.
     * @param status The result of the write operation {@link BluetoothGatt#GATT_SUCCESS} if the
     * operation succeeds.
