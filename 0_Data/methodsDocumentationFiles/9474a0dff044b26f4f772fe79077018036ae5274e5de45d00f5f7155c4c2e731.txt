     * Returns a stream producing the given {@code streamSize} number of
     * pseudorandom {@code double} values, each between zero
     * (inclusive) and one (exclusive).
     *
     * <p>A pseudorandom {@code double} value is generated as if it's the result
     * of calling the method {@link #nextDouble()}.
     *
     * @param streamSize the number of values to generate
     * @return a stream of {@code double} values
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code streamSize} is
     *         less than zero
