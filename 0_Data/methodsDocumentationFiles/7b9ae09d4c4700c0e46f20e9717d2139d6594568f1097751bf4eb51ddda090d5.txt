     * Returns one of the following constants that represents the current state of Telecom:
     *
     * {@link TelephonyManager#CALL_STATE_RINGING}
     * {@link TelephonyManager#CALL_STATE_OFFHOOK}
     * {@link TelephonyManager#CALL_STATE_IDLE}
     *
     * Note that this API does not require the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_PHONE_STATE} permission. This is intentional, to
     * preserve the behavior of {@link TelephonyManager#getCallState()}, which also did not require
     * the permission.
     *
     * Takes into consideration both managed and self-managed calls.
