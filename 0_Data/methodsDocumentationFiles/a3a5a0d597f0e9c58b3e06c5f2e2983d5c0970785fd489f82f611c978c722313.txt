     * Gets the baseband carrier-to-noise density in dB-Hz.
     *
     * <p>Typical range: 10-50 dB-Hz. The range of possible baseband C/N0 values is 0-63 dB-Hz to
     * handle some edge cases.
     *
     * <p>The value contains the measured C/N0 for the signal at the baseband. This is typically
     * a few dB weaker than the value estimated for C/N0 at the antenna port, which is reported
     * in {@link #getCn0DbHz()}.
