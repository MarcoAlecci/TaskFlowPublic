         * Sets the measured dimensions from the given bounding box of the children and the
         * measurement specs that were passed into {@link RecyclerView#onMeasure(int, int)}. It is
         * called after the RecyclerView calls
         * {@link LayoutManager#onLayoutChildren(Recycler, State)} during a measurement pass.
         * <p>
         * This method should call {@link #setMeasuredDimension(int, int)}.
         * <p>
         * The default implementation adds the RecyclerView's padding to the given bounding box
         * then caps the value to be within the given measurement specs.
         * <p>
         * This method is only called if the LayoutManager opted into the auto measurement API.
