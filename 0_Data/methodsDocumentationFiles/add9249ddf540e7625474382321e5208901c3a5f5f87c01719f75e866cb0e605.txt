     * Retrieves an identifier for a bitmap.
     *
     * The format of an identifier is opaque to the application,
     * with a special case of value 0 being invalid.
     * An identifier for a given image-tuner pair is unique, so an application
     * may cache images and determine if there is a necessity to fetch them
     * again - if identifier changes, it means the image has changed.
     *
     * Only bitmap keys may be used with this method:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #METADATA_KEY_ICON}</li>
     * <li>{@link #METADATA_KEY_ART}</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param key The key the value is stored under.
     * @return a bitmap identifier or 0 if it's missing.
