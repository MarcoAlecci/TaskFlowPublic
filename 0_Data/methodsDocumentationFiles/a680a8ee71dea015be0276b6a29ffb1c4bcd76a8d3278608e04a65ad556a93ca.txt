     * This method behaves exactly as {@link #sendAccessibilityEvent(int)} but
     * takes as an argument an empty {@link AccessibilityEvent} and does not
     * perform a check whether accessibility is enabled.
     * <p>
     * If an {@link AccessibilityDelegate} has been specified via calling
     * {@link #setAccessibilityDelegate(AccessibilityDelegate)} its
     * {@link AccessibilityDelegate#sendAccessibilityEventUnchecked(View, AccessibilityEvent)}
     * is responsible for handling this call.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param event The event to send.

     * @see #sendAccessibilityEvent(int)
