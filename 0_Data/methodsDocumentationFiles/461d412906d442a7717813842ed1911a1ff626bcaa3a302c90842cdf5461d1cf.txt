     * Return string describing the elapsed time since startTime formatted like
     * "[relative time/date], [time]".
     * <p>
     * Example output strings for the US date format.
     * <ul>
     * <li>3 min. ago, 10:15 AM</li>
     * <li>Yesterday, 12:20 PM</li>
     * <li>Dec 12, 4:12 AM</li>
     * <li>11/14/2007, 8:20 AM</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param time some time in the past.
     * @param minResolution the minimum elapsed time (in milliseconds) to report
     *            when showing relative times. For example, a time 3 seconds in
     *            the past will be reported as "0 minutes ago" if this is set to
     *            {@link #MINUTE_IN_MILLIS}.
     * @param transitionResolution the elapsed time (in milliseconds) at which
     *            to stop reporting relative measurements. Elapsed times greater
     *            than this resolution will default to normal date formatting.
     *            For example, will transition from "7 days ago" to "Dec 12"
     *            when using {@link #WEEK_IN_MILLIS}.
