         * Adds a layout rule to be interpreted by the RelativeLayout.
         * <p>
         * Use this for verbs that refer to a sibling (ex.
         * {@link #ALIGN_RIGHT}) or take a boolean value (ex.
         * {@link #CENTER_IN_PARENT}).
         * <p>
         * If the rule is relative to the layout direction (ex.
         * {@link #START_OF}), then the layout direction must be resolved using
         * {@link #resolveLayoutDirection(int)} before calling
         * {@link #getRule(int)} with an absolute rule (ex. {@link #LEFT_OF}.
         *
         * @param verb a layout verb, such as {@link #ALIGN_RIGHT}
         * @param subject the ID of another view to use as an anchor, or a
         *                boolean value (represented as {@link #TRUE} for true
         *                or 0 for false)
