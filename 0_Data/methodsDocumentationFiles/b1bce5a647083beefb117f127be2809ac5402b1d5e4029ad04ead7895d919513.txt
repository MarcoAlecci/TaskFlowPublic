     * Reads a signed 32-bit integer from this file. This method reads 4
     * bytes from the file, starting at the current file pointer.
     * If the bytes read, in order, are {@code b1},
     * {@code b2}, {@code b3}, and {@code b4}, where
     * <code>0&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;b1, b2, b3, b4&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;255</code>,
     * then the result is equal to:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *     (b1 &lt;&lt; 24) | (b2 &lt;&lt; 16) + (b3 &lt;&lt; 8) + b4
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until the four bytes are read, the end of the
     * stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @return     the next four bytes of this file, interpreted as an
     *             {@code int}.
     * @exception  EOFException  if this file reaches the end before reading
     *               four bytes.
     * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
