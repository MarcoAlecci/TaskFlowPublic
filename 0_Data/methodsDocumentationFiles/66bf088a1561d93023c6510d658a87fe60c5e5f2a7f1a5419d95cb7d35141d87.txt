     * Swap in a new Cursor, returning the old Cursor.  Unlike
     * {@link #changeCursor(Cursor)}, the returned old Cursor is <em>not</em>
     * closed.
     *
     * @param newCursor The new cursor to be used.
     * @return Returns the previously set Cursor, or null if there was not one.
     * If the given new Cursor is the same instance is the previously set
     * Cursor, null is also returned.
