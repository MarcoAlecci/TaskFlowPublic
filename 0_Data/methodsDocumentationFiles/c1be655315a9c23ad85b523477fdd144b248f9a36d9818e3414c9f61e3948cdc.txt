     * Returns the estimated minimum buffer size required for an AudioTrack
     * object to be created in the {@link #MODE_STREAM} mode.
     * The size is an estimate because it does not consider either the route or the sink,
     * since neither is known yet.  Note that this size doesn't
     * guarantee a smooth playback under load, and higher values should be chosen according to
     * the expected frequency at which the buffer will be refilled with additional data to play.
     * For example, if you intend to dynamically set the source sample rate of an AudioTrack
     * to a higher value than the initial source sample rate, be sure to configure the buffer size
     * based on the highest planned sample rate.
     * @param sampleRateInHz the source sample rate expressed in Hz.
     *   {@link AudioFormat#SAMPLE_RATE_UNSPECIFIED} is not permitted.
     * @param channelConfig describes the configuration of the audio channels.
     *   See {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_OUT_MONO} and
     *   {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_OUT_STEREO}
     * @param audioFormat the format in which the audio data is represented.
     *   See {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_16BIT} and
     *   {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_8BIT},
     *   and {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_FLOAT}.
     * @return {@link #ERROR_BAD_VALUE} if an invalid parameter was passed,
     *   or {@link #ERROR} if unable to query for output properties,
     *   or the minimum buffer size expressed in bytes.
