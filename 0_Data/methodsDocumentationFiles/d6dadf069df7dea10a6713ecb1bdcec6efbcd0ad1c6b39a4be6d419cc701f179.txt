         * Sets the value of a field, using a custom {@link RemoteViews presentation} to
         * visualize it and an {@link InlinePresentation} to visualize it as an inline suggestion.
         *
         * <p><b>Note:</b> If the dataset requires authentication but the service knows its text
         * value it's easier to filter by calling
         * {@link #setValue(AutofillId, AutofillValue, RemoteViews)} and using the value to filter.

         * @param id id returned by {@link
         *        android.app.assist.AssistStructure.ViewNode#getAutofillId()}.
         * @param value the value to be autofilled. Pass {@code null} if you do not have the value
         *        but the target view is a logical part of the dataset. For example, if
         *        the dataset needs authentication and you have no access to the value.
         * @param presentation the presentation used to visualize this field.
         * @param inlinePresentation The {@link InlinePresentation} used to visualize this dataset
         *        as inline suggestions. If the dataset supports inline suggestions,
         *        this should not be null.
