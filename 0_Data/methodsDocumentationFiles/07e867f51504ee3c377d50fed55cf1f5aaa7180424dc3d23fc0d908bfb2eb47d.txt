     * Called to inform an app that a slice has been pinned.
     * <p>
     * Pinning is a way that slice hosts use to notify apps of which slices
     * they care about updates for. When a slice is pinned the content is
     * expected to be relatively fresh and kept up to date.
     * <p>
     * Being pinned does not provide any escalated privileges for the slice
     * provider. So apps should do things such as turn on syncing or schedule
     * a job in response to a onSlicePinned.
     * <p>
     * Pinned state is not persisted through a reboot, and apps can expect a
     * new call to onSlicePinned for any slices that should remain pinned
     * after a reboot occurs.
     *
     * @param sliceUri The uri of the slice being unpinned.
     * @see #onSliceUnpinned(Uri)
