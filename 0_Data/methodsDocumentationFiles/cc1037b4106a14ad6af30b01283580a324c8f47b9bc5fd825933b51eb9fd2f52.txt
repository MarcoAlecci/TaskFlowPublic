         * Called when the network is about to be lost, typically because there are no outstanding
         * requests left for it. This may be paired with a {@link NetworkCallback#onAvailable} call
         * with the new replacement network for graceful handover. This method is not guaranteed
         * to be called before {@link NetworkCallback#onLost} is called, for example in case a
         * network is suddenly disconnected.
         *
         * <p>Do NOT call {@link #getNetworkCapabilities(Network)} or
         * {@link #getLinkProperties(Network)} or other synchronous ConnectivityManager methods in
         * this callback as this is prone to race conditions ; calling these methods while in a
         * callback may return an outdated or even a null object.
         *
         * @param network The {@link Network} that is about to be lost.
         * @param maxMsToLive The time in milliseconds the system intends to keep the network
         *                    connected for graceful handover; note that the network may still
         *                    suffer a hard loss at any time.
