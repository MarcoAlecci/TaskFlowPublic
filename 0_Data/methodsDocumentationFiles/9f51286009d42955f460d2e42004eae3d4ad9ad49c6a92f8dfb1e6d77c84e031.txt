     * the scroll capture API and application UI code. If no callback is set, the system may provide
     * an implementation. Any value provided here will take precedence over a system version.
     * <p>
     * This view will be ignored when {@link #SCROLL_CAPTURE_HINT_EXCLUDE} is set in its {@link
     * #setScrollCaptureHint(int) scrollCaptureHint}, regardless whether a callback has been set.
     * <p>
     * It is recommended to set the scroll capture hint {@link #SCROLL_CAPTURE_HINT_INCLUDE} when
     * setting a custom callback to help ensure it is selected as the target.
