     * Returns the packed position representation of a child's position.
     * <p>
     * In general, a packed position should be used in
     * situations where the position given to/returned from an
     * {@link ExpandableListAdapter} or {@link ExpandableListView} method can
     * either be a child or group. The two positions are packed into a single
     * long which can be unpacked using
     * {@link #getPackedPositionChild(long)},
     * {@link #getPackedPositionGroup(long)}, and
     * {@link #getPackedPositionType(long)}.
     *
     * @param groupPosition The child's parent group's position.
     * @param childPosition The child position within the group.
     * @return The packed position representation of the child (and parent group).
