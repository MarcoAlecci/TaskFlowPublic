     * Convenience method that decodes the remaining content of a single input
     * byte buffer into a newly-allocated character buffer.
     *
     * <p> This method implements an entire <a href="#steps">decoding
     * operation</a>; that is, it resets this decoder, then it decodes the
     * bytes in the given byte buffer, and finally it flushes this
     * decoder.  This method should therefore not be invoked if a decoding
     * operation is already in progress.  </p>
     *
     * @param  in
     *         The input byte buffer
     *
     * @return A newly-allocated character buffer containing the result of the
     *         decoding operation.  The buffer's position will be zero and its
     *         limit will follow the last character written.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException
     *          If a decoding operation is already in progress
     *
     * @throws  MalformedInputException
     *          If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
     *          position is not legal for this charset and the current malformed-input action
     *          is {@link CodingErrorAction#REPORT}
     *
     * @throws  UnmappableCharacterException
     *          If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
     *          position cannot be mapped to an equivalent character sequence and
     *          the current unmappable-character action is {@link
     *          CodingErrorAction#REPORT}
