     * Create a waveform vibration.
     *
     * Waveform vibrations are a potentially repeating series of timing and amplitude pairs. For
     * each pair, the value in the amplitude array determines the strength of the vibration and the
     * value in the timing array determines how long it vibrates for, in milliseconds. Amplitude
     * values must be between 0 and 255, and an amplitude of 0 implies no vibration (i.e. off). Any
     * pairs with a timing value of 0 will be ignored.
     * </p><p>
     * To cause the pattern to repeat, pass the index into the timings array at which to start the
     * repetition, or -1 to disable repeating.

     * @param timings The timing values, in milliseconds, of the timing / amplitude pairs. Timing
     *                values of 0 will cause the pair to be ignored.
     * @param amplitudes The amplitude values of the timing / amplitude pairs. Amplitude values
     *                   must be between 0 and 255, or equal to {@link #DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE}. An
     *                   amplitude value of 0 implies the motor is off.
     * @param repeat The index into the timings array at which to repeat, or -1 if you you don't
     *               want to repeat.
     *
     * @return The desired effect.
