     * Returns an estimate of the number of active threads in this thread
     * group and its subgroups. Recursively iterates over all subgroups in
     * this thread group.
     *
     * <p> The value returned is only an estimate because the number of
     * threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal
     * data structures, and might be affected by the presence of certain
     * system threads. This method is intended primarily for debugging
     * and monitoring purposes.

     * @return  an estimate of the number of active threads in this thread
