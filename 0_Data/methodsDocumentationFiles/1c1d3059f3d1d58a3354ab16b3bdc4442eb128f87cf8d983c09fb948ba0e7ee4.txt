     * This call warms up the hardware and starts scanning for valid biometrics. It terminates
     * when {@link AuthenticationCallback#onAuthenticationError(int,
     * CharSequence)} is called or when {@link AuthenticationCallback#onAuthenticationSucceeded(
     * AuthenticationResult)} is called. This operation can be canceled by using the provided cancel
     * object. The application wil receive authentication errors through
     * {@link AuthenticationCallback}. Calling {@link BiometricAuthenticator#authenticate(
     * CryptoObject, CancellationSignal, Executor, AuthenticationCallback)} while an existing
     * authentication attempt is occurring will stop the previous client and start a new
     * authentication. The interrupted client will receive a cancelled notification through
     * {@link AuthenticationCallback#onAuthenticationError(int, CharSequence)}.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If any of the arguments are null
     *
     * @param cancel An object that can be used to cancel authentication
     * @param executor An executor to handle callback events
     * @param callback An object to receive authentication events
