     * Start sampling-based method tracing, specifying the trace log file name,
     * the buffer size, and the sampling interval.
     * <p>
     * When a relative file path is given, the trace file will be placed under
     * your package-specific directory on primary shared/external storage, as
     * returned by {@link Context#getExternalFilesDir(String)}.
     * <p>
     * See <a href="{@docRoot}studio/profile/traceview.html">Inspect Trace Logs
     * with Traceview</a> for information about reading trace files.
     *
     * @param tracePath Path to the trace log file to create. If {@code null},
     *            this will default to "dmtrace.trace". If the file already
     *            exists, it will be truncated. If the path given does not end
     *            in ".trace", it will be appended for you.
     * @param bufferSize The maximum amount of trace data we gather. If not
     *            given, it defaults to 8MB.
     * @param intervalUs The amount of time between each sample in microseconds.
