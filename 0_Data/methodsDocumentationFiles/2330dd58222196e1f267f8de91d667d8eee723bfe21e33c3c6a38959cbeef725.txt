     * a new editor.  This will always be called after {@link #onStartInput},
     * allowing you to do your general setup there and just view-specific
     * setup here.  You are guaranteed that {@link #onCreateInputView()} will
     * have been called some time before this function is called.
     * 
     * @param info Description of the type of text being edited.
     * @param restarting Set to true if we are restarting input on the
     * same text field as before.
