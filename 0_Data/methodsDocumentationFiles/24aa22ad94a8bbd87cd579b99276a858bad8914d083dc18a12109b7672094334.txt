     * Returns the local address of this server socket.
     * <p>
     * If the socket was bound prior to being {@link #close closed},
     * then this method will continue to return the local address
     * after the socket is closed.
     * <p>
     * If there is a security manager set, its {@code checkConnect} method is
     * called with the local address and {@code -1} as its arguments to see
     * if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed,
     * the {@link InetAddress#getLoopbackAddress loopback} address is returned.
     *
     * @return  the address to which this socket is bound,
     *          or the loopback address if denied by the security manager,
     *          or {@code null} if the socket is unbound.
