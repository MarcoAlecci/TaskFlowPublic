     *
     * <p>Using empty or {@code null} {@code outputs} is the same as unconfiguring.</p>
     *
     * <p>Every surface in {@code outputs} must be non-{@code null}.</p>
     *
     * @param outputs a list of surfaces to set. LegacyCameraDevice will take ownership of this
     *          list; it must not be modified by the caller once it's passed in.
     * @return an error code for this binder operation, or {@link NO_ERROR}
     *          on success.
