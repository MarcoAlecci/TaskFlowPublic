     * If the calling process and user ID has not been granted
     * permission to access a specific URI, throw {@link
     * SecurityException}.  This is basically the same as calling
     * {@link #enforceUriPermission(Uri, int, int, int, String)} with
     * the pid and uid returned by {@link
     * android.os.Binder#getCallingPid} and {@link
     * android.os.Binder#getCallingUid}.  One important difference is
     * that if you are not currently processing an IPC, this function
     * will always throw a SecurityException.
     *
     * @param uri The uri that is being checked.
     * @param modeFlags The access modes to enforce.
     * @param message A message to include in the exception if it is thrown.

     * @see #checkCallingUriPermission(Uri, int)
