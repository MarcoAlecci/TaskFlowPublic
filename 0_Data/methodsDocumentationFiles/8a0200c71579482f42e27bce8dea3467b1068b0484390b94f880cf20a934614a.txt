     * Please use {@link #writeBundle} instead.  Flattens a Map into the parcel
     * at the current dataPosition(),
     * growing dataCapacity() if needed.  The Map keys must be String objects.
     * The Map values are written using {@link #writeValue} and must follow
     * the specification there.
     *
     * <p>It is strongly recommended to use {@link #writeBundle} instead of
     * this method, since the Bundle class provides a type-safe API that
     * allows you to avoid mysterious type errors at the point of marshalling.
