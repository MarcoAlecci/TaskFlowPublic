     * Set this to true if you want the ImageView to adjust its bounds
     * to preserve the aspect ratio of its drawable.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the application targets API level 17 or lower,
     * adjustViewBounds will allow the drawable to shrink the view bounds, but not grow
     * to fill available measured space in all cases. This is for compatibility with
     * legacy {@link android.view.View.MeasureSpec MeasureSpec} and
     * {@link android.widget.RelativeLayout RelativeLayout} behavior.</p>

     * @param adjustViewBounds Whether to adjust the bounds of this view
     * to preserve the original aspect ratio of the drawable.
