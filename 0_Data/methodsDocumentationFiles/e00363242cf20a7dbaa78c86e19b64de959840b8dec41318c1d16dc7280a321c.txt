     * Out-of-range digits are treated as 0 for the sake of the time stamp,
     * because of this:
     *
     * TS 23.040 section 9.2.3.11
     * "if the MS receives a non-integer value in the SCTS, it shall
     * assume the digit is set to 0 but shall store the entire field
     * exactly as received"
