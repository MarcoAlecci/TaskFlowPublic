     * Set whether LayoutManager will recycle its children when it is detached from
     * RecyclerView.
     * <p>
     * If you are using a {@link RecyclerView.RecycledViewPool}, it might be a good idea to set
     * this flag to <code>true</code> so that views will be available to other RecyclerViews
     * immediately.
     * <p>
     * Note that, setting this flag will result in a performance drop if RecyclerView
     * is restored.
     *
     * @param recycleChildrenOnDetach Whether children should be recycled in detach or not.
