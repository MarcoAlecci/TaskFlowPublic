     * Gets a {@link Canvas} for drawing into this surface.
     *
     * After drawing into the provided {@link Canvas}, the caller must
     * invoke {@link #unlockCanvasAndPost} to post the new contents to the surface.
     *
     * @param inOutDirty A rectangle that represents the dirty region that the caller wants
     * to redraw.  This function may choose to expand the dirty rectangle if for example
     * the surface has been resized or if the previous contents of the surface were
     * not available.  The caller must redraw the entire dirty region as represented
     * by the contents of the inOutDirty rectangle upon return from this function.
     * The caller may also pass <code>null</code> instead, in the case where the
     * entire surface should be redrawn.
     * @return A canvas for drawing into the surface.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the inOutDirty rectangle is not valid.
     * @throws OutOfResourcesException If the canvas cannot be locked.
