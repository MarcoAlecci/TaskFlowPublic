     * Set the desired interval for active location updates, in milliseconds.
     *
     * <p>The location manager will actively try to obtain location updates
     * for your application at this interval, so it has a
     * direct influence on the amount of power used by your application.
     * Choose your interval wisely.
     *
     * <p>This interval is inexact. You may not receive updates at all (if
     * no location sources are available), or you may receive them
     * slower than requested. You may also receive them faster than
     * requested (if other applications are requesting location at a
     * faster interval). The fastest rate that you will receive
     * updates can be controlled with {@link #setFastestInterval}.
     *
     * <p>Applications with only the coarse location permission may have their
     * interval silently throttled.
     *
     * <p>An interval of 0 is allowed, but not recommended, since
     * location updates may be extremely fast on future implementations.
     *
     * <p>{@link #setQuality} and {@link #setInterval} are the most important parameters
     * on a location request.
