         * Returns an {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo} representing the host view from the
         * point of view of an {@link android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService}.
         * This method is responsible for obtaining an accessibility node info from a
         * pool of reusable instances and calling
         * {@link #onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(AccessibilityNodeInfo)} on the host
         * view to initialize the former.
         * <p>
         * <strong>Note:</strong> The client is responsible for recycling the obtained
         * instance by calling {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo#recycle()} to minimize object
         * creation.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * The default implementation behaves as
         * {@link View#createAccessibilityNodeInfo() View#createAccessibilityNodeInfo()} for
         * the case of no accessibility delegate been set.
