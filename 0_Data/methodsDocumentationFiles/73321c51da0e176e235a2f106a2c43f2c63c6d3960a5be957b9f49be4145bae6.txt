     * Must be called by the agent to indicate whether the network was manually selected by the
     * user. This should be called before the network becomes connected, so it can be given
     * special treatment when it does.
     *
     * If {@code explicitlySelected} is {@code true}, and {@code acceptUnvalidated} is {@code true},
     * then the system will switch to this network. If {@code explicitlySelected} is {@code true}
     * and {@code acceptUnvalidated} is {@code false}, and the  network cannot be validated, the
     * system will ask the user whether to switch to this network.  If the user confirms and selects
     * "don't ask again", then the system will call {@link #saveAcceptUnvalidated} to persist the
     * user's choice. Thus, if the transport ever calls this method with {@code explicitlySelected}
     * set to {@code true} and {@code acceptUnvalidated} set to {@code false}, it must also
     * implement {@link #saveAcceptUnvalidated} to respect the user's choice.
     *
     * If  {@code explicitlySelected} is {@code false} and {@code acceptUnvalidated} is
     * {@code true}, the system will interpret this as the user having accepted partial connectivity
     * on this network. Thus, the system will switch to the network and consider it validated even
     * if it only provides partial connectivity, but the network is not otherwise treated specially.
     * @hide should move to NetworkAgentConfig.
