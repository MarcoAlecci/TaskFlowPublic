     * Called after {@link #onMapSharedElements(java.util.List, java.util.Map)} when
     * transferring shared elements in. Any shared elements that have no mapping will be in
     * <var>rejectedSharedElements</var>. The elements remaining in
     * <var>rejectedSharedElements</var> will be transitioned out of the Scene. If a
     * View is removed from <var>rejectedSharedElements</var>, it must be handled by the
     * <code>SharedElementCallback</code>.
     * <p>
     * Views in rejectedSharedElements will have their position and size set to the
     * position of the calling shared element, relative to the Window decor View and contain
     * snapshots of the View from the calling Activity or Fragment. This
     * view may be safely added to the decor View's overlay to remain in position.
     * </p>
     * <p>This method is not called for Fragment Transitions. All rejected shared elements
     * will be handled by the exit transition.</p>

     * @param rejectedSharedElements Views containing visual information of shared elements
     *                               that are not part of the entering scene. These Views
     *                               are positioned relative to the Window decor View. A
