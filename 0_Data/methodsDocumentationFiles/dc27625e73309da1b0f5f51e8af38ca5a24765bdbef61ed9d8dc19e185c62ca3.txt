     * Return the font's interline spacing, given the Paint's settings for
     * typeface, textSize, etc. If metrics is not null, return the fontmetric
     * values in it. Note: all values have been converted to integers from
     * floats, in such a way has to make the answers useful for both spacing
     * and clipping. If you want more control over the rounding, call
     * getFontMetrics().
     *
     * <p>Note that these are the values for the main typeface, and actual text rendered may need a
     * larger set of values because fallback fonts may get used in rendering the text.
