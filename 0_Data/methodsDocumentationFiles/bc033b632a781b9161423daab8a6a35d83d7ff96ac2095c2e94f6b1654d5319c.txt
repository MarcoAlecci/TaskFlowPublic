     * Returns a {@code BigInteger} whose value is greatest common divisor
     * of {@code this} and {@code value}. If {@code this == 0} and {@code
     * value == 0} then zero is returned, otherwise the result is positive.
     *
     * @param value value with which the greatest common divisor is computed.
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code value == null}.
