         * Returns the supported performance points. May return {@code null} if the codec did not
         * publish any performance point information (e.g. the vendor codecs have not been updated
         * to the latest android release). May return an empty list if the codec published that
         * if does not guarantee any performance points.
         * <p>
         * This is a performance guarantee provided by the device manufacturer for hardware codecs
         * based on hardware capabilities of the device.
         * <p>
         * The returned list is sorted first by decreasing number of pixels, then by decreasing
         * width, and finally by decreasing frame rate.
         * Performance points assume a single active codec. For use cases where multiple
         * codecs are active, should use that highest pixel count, and add the frame rates of
         * each individual codec.
