     * Called in response to the {@link AppWidgetManager#ACTION_APPWIDGET_RESTORED} broadcast
     * when instances of this AppWidget provider have been restored from backup.  If your
     * provider maintains any persistent data about its widget instances, override this method
     * to remap the old AppWidgetIds to the new values and update any other app state that may
     * be relevant.
     *
     * <p>This callback will be followed immediately by a call to {@link #onUpdate} so your
     * provider can immediately generate new RemoteViews suitable for its newly-restored set
     * of instances.
     *
     * <p>In addition, you should set {@link AppWidgetManager#OPTION_APPWIDGET_RESTORE_COMPLETED}
     * to true indicate if a widget has been restored successfully from the provider's side.
