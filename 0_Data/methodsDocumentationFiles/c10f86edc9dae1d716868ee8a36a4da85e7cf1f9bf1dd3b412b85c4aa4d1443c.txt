     * Restore a state that was previously returned by {@link #saveInstanceState}.  This
     * adds to the activity group information about all activity IDs that had
     * previously been saved, even if they have not been started yet, so if the
     * user later navigates to them the correct state will be restored.
     * 
     * <p>Note: This does <b>not</b> change the current running activity, or
     * start whatever activity was previously running when the state was saved.
     * That is up to the client to do, in whatever way it thinks is best.
     * 
     * @param state a previously saved state; does nothing if this is null
     * 
     * @see #saveInstanceState
