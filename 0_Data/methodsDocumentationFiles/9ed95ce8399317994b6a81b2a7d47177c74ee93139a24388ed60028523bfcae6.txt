     * Gets the Doppler Shift in Hz.
     * A positive value indicates that the SV is moving toward the receiver.
     *
     * The reference frequency is given by the value of {@link #getCarrierFrequencyInHz()}.
     * The reported doppler shift includes {@link #getDopplerShiftUncertaintyInHz()}.
     *
     * The value is only available if {@link #hasDopplerShiftInHz()} is true.
