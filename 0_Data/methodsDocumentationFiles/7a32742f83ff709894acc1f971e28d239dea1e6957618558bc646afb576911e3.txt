     * Retrieve the size information for a package.
     * Since this may take a little while, the result will
     * be posted back to the given observer.  The calling context
     * should have the {@link android.Manifest.permission#GET_PACKAGE_SIZE} permission.
     *
     * @param packageName The name of the package whose size information is to be retrieved
     * @param userId The user whose size information should be retrieved.
     * @param observer An observer callback to get notified when the operation
     * is complete.
     * {@link android.content.pm.IPackageStatsObserver#onGetStatsCompleted(PackageStats, boolean)}
     * The observer's callback is invoked with a PackageStats object(containing the
     * code, data and cache sizes of the package) and a boolean value representing
     * the status of the operation. observer may be null to indicate that
     * no callback is desired.
     *
     * @deprecated use {@link StorageStatsManager} instead.
