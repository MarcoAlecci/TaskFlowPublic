     * Dispatches a change notification to the observer.
     * <p>
     * If a {@link Handler} was supplied to the {@link ContentObserver}
     * constructor, then a call to the {@link #onChange} method is posted to the
     * handler's message queue. Otherwise, the {@link #onChange} method is
     * invoked immediately on this thread.
     *
     * @deprecated Callers should migrate towards using a richer overload that
     *             provides more details about the change, such as
     *             {@link #dispatchChange(boolean, Collection, int)}.
