     * Queries the service for a set of supported voices.

     * Can be called on multiple threads.
     *
     * The default implementation tries to enumerate all available locales, pass them to
     * {@link #onIsLanguageAvailable(String, String, String)} and create Voice instances (using
     * the locale's BCP-47 language tag as the voice name) for the ones that are supported.
     * Note, that this implementation is suitable only for engines that don't have multiple voices
     * for a single locale. Also, this implementation won't work with Locales not listed in the
     * set returned by the {@link Locale#getAvailableLocales()} method.
     *
     * @return A list of voices supported.
