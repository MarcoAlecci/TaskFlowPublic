     * Destroys the rendering context of this HardwareRenderer. This destroys the resources
     * associated with this renderer and releases the currently set {@link Surface}. This must
     * be called when this HardwareRenderer is no longer needed.
     *
     * <p>The renderer may be restored from this state by setting a new {@link Surface}, setting
     * new rendering content with {@link #setContentRoot(RenderNode)}, and resuming
     * rendering by issuing a new {@link FrameRenderRequest}.
     *
     * <p>It is recommended to call this in response to callbacks such as
     * {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback#surfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder)}.
     *
     * <p>Note that if there are any outstanding frame commit callbacks they may never being
     * invoked if the frame was deferred to a later vsync.
