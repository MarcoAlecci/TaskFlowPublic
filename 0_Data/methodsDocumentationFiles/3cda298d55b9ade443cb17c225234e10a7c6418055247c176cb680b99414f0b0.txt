     * Parses the header of a Binder call's response Parcel and
     * returns the exception code.  Deals with lite or fat headers.
     * In the common successful case, this header is generally zero.
     * In less common cases, it's a small negative number and will be
     * followed by an error string.

     * insulating it from having to handle fat headers as returned by
     * e.g. StrictMode-induced RPC responses.
