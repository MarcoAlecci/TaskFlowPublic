     * Starts recording a display list for the render node. All
     * operations performed on the returned canvas are recorded and
     * stored in this display list.
     *
     * {@link #endRecording()} must be called when the recording is finished in order to apply
     * the updated display list. Failing to call {@link #endRecording()} will result in an
     * {@link IllegalStateException} if {@link #beginRecording(int, int)} is called again.
     *
     * @param width  The width of the recording viewport. This will not alter the width of the
     *               RenderNode itself, that must be set with {@link #setPosition(Rect)}.
     * @param height The height of the recording viewport. This will not alter the height of the
     *               RenderNode itself, that must be set with {@link #setPosition(Rect)}.
     * @return A canvas to record drawing operations.
     * @throws IllegalStateException If a recording is already in progress. That is, the previous
     * call to {@link #beginRecording(int, int)} did not call {@link #endRecording()}.
