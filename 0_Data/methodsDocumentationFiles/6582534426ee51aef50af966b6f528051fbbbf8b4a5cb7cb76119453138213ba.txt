         * Check whether this request is currently active.  A request becomes inactive after
         * calling {@link #cancel} or a final result method that completes the request.  After
         * this point, further interactions with the request will result in
         * {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException} errors; you should not catch these errors,
         * but can use this method if you need to determine the state of the request.  Returns
         * true if the request is still active.
