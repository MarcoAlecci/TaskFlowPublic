     * Return whether the given user is actively running.  This means that
     * the user is in the "started" state, not "stopped" -- it is currently
     * allowed to run code through scheduled alarms, receiving broadcasts,
     * etc.  A started user may be either the current foreground user or a
     * background user; the result here does not distinguish between the two.
     *
     * <p>Note prior to Android Nougat MR1 (SDK version <= 24;
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N}, this API required a system permission
     * in order to check other profile's status.
     * Since Android Nougat MR1 (SDK version >= 25;
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N_MR1}), the restriction has been relaxed, and now
     * it'll accept any {@link android.os.UserHandle} within the same profile group as the caller.
     *
     * @param user The user to retrieve the running state for.
