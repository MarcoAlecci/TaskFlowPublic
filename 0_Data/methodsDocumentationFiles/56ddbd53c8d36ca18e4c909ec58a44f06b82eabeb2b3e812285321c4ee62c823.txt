     * Compares this object against the specified object. The result is {@code true}
     * if and only if the argument is not {@code null} and is a {@code Half} object
     * that represents the same half-precision value as the this object. Two
     * half-precision values are considered to be the same if and only if the method
     * {@link #halfToIntBits(short)} returns an identical {@code int} value for both.
     *
     * @param o The object to compare
     * @return True if the objects are the same, false otherwise
