     * Create a BitmapRegionDecoder from the file descriptor.
     * The position within the descriptor will not be changed when
     * this returns, so the descriptor can be used again as is.
     * Currently only the JPEG and PNG formats are supported.
     *
     * @param fd The file descriptor containing the data to decode
     * @param isShareable If this is true, then the BitmapRegionDecoder may keep a
     *                    shallow reference to the input. If this is false,
     *                    then the BitmapRegionDecoder will explicitly make a copy of the
     *                    input data, and keep that. Even if sharing is allowed,
     *                    the implementation may still decide to make a deep
     *                    copy of the input data. If an image is progressively encoded,
     *                    allowing sharing may degrade the decoding speed.
     * @return BitmapRegionDecoder, or null if the image data could not be decoded.
     * @throws IOException if the image format is not supported or can not be decoded.
