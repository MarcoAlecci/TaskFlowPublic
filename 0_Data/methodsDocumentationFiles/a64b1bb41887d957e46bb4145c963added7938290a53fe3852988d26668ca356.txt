     * Called when the window containing this view gains or loses focus.  Note
     * that this is separate from view focus: to receive key events, both
     * your view and its window must have focus.  If a window is displayed
     * on top of yours that takes input focus, then your own window will lose
     * focus but the view focus will remain unchanged.
     *
     * @param hasWindowFocus True if the window containing this view now has
     *        focus, false otherwise.
