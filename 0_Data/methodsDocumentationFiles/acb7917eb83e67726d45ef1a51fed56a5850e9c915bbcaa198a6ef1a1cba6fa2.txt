     * Return the Bluetooth Class of Device (CoD) value including the
     * {@link BluetoothClass.Service}, {@link BluetoothClass.Device.Major} and
     * minor device fields.
     *
     * <p>This value is a byte array representation of Bluetooth CoD as in
     * Bluetooth specification.
     *
     * <p>Bluetooth COD information is 3 bytes, but stored as an int. Hence the
     * MSB is useless and needs to be thrown away. The lower 3 bytes are
     * converted into a byte array MSB to LSB. Hence, using BIG_ENDIAN.
