     * This connection is automatically granted and persisted after a reboot.
     *
     * <p>The designated package should declare a {@link VpnService} in its
     *    manifest guarded by {@link android.Manifest.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE},
     *    otherwise the call will fail.
     *
     * @param userId The identifier of the user to set an always-on VPN for.
     * @param vpnPackage The package name for an installed VPN app on the device, or {@code null}
     *                   to remove an existing always-on VPN configuration.
     * @param lockdownEnabled {@code true} to disallow networking when the VPN is not connected or
     *        {@code false} otherwise.
     * @param lockdownWhitelist The list of packages that are allowed to access network directly
     *         when VPN is in lockdown mode but is not running. Non-existent packages are ignored so

     *         uninstalled.
     * @return {@code true} if the package is set as always-on VPN controller;
