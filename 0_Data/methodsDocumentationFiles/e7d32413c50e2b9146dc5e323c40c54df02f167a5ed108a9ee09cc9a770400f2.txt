     * Set the beginning of the next contour relative to the last point on the
     * previous contour. If there is no previous contour, this is treated the
     * same as moveTo().
     *
     * @param dx The amount to add to the x-coordinate of the end of the
     *           previous contour, to specify the start of a new contour
     * @param dy The amount to add to the y-coordinate of the end of the
     *           previous contour, to specify the start of a new contour
