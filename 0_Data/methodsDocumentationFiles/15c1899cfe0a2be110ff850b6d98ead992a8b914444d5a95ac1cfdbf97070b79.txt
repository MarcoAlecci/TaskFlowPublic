         * Defines the minimum velocity which will be considered as a swipe action by the user.
         * <p>
         * You can increase this value to make it harder to swipe or decrease it to make it easier.
         * Keep in mind that ItemTouchHelper also checks the perpendicular velocity and makes sure
         * current direction velocity is larger then the perpendicular one. Otherwise, user's
         * movement is ambiguous. You can change the threshold by overriding
         * {@link #getSwipeVelocityThreshold(float)}.
         * <p>
         * The velocity is calculated in pixels per second.
         * <p>
         * The default framework value is passed as a parameter so that you can modify it with a
         * multiplier.
         *
         * @param defaultValue The default value (in pixels per second) used by the
         *                     ItemTouchHelper.
         * @return The minimum swipe velocity. The default implementation returns the
         * <code>defaultValue</code> parameter.
