     * The attestation record is a chain of certificates. The leaf certificate links to the public
     * key of this key pair and other properties of the key or the device. If the key is in secure
     * hardware, and if the secure hardware supports attestation, the leaf certificate will be
     * signed by a chain of certificates rooted at a trustworthy CA key. Otherwise the chain will be
     * rooted at an untrusted certificate.

     * The attestation record could be for properties of the key, or include device identifiers.
