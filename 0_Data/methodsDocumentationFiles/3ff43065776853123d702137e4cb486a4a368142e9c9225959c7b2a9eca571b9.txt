     * <p>This method will be called once for every incoming text SMS. You can invoke the callback
     * with a bitmask to tell the platform how to handle the SMS. For a SMS received on a
     * file-based encryption capable device while the credential-encrypted storage is not available,
     * this method will be called for the second time when the credential-encrypted storage becomes
     * available after the user unlocks the phone, if the bit {@link #RECEIVE_OPTIONS_DROP} is not
     * set when invoking the callback.
     *
     * @param pdu the PDUs of the message
     * @param format the format of the PDUs, typically "3gpp" or "3gpp2"
     * @param destPort the destination port of a binary SMS, this will be -1 for text SMS
     * @param subId SMS subscription ID of the SIM
     * @param callback result callback. Call with a bitmask integer to indicate how the incoming
     *        text SMS should be handled by the platform. Use {@link #RECEIVE_OPTIONS_DROP} and
     *        {@link #RECEIVE_OPTIONS_SKIP_NOTIFY_WHEN_CREDENTIAL_PROTECTED_STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE}
     *        to set the flags in the bitmask.
