     * Load data from legacy user wifi config store file.
     * <p>
     * Expected AOSP format is available in the sample files under {@code /frameworks/base/wifi/
     * java/android/net/wifi/migration_samples}.

     * <p>
     * Note:
     * <li>OEMs need to change the implementation of
     * {@link #convertAndRetrieveUserConfigStoreFile(int, UserHandle)} only if their existing config
     * store format or file locations differs from the vanilla AOSP implementation.</li>
     * <li>The wifi apex will invoke
     * {@link #convertAndRetrieveUserConfigStoreFile(int, UserHandle)}
     * method on every bootup, it is the responsibility of the OEM implementation to ensure that
     * they perform the necessary in place conversion of their config store file to conform to the
     * AOSP format. The OEM should ensure that the method should only return the
     * {@link InputStream} stream for the data to be migrated only on the first bootup.</li>
     * <li>Once the migration is done, the apex will invoke
     * {@link #removeUserConfigStoreFile(int, UserHandle)} to delete the store file.</li>
     * <li>The only relevant invocation of
     * {@link #convertAndRetrieveUserConfigStoreFile(int, UserHandle)} occurs when a previously
     * released device upgrades to the wifi apex from an OEM implementation of the wifi
     * stack.
     * </li>
     * <li>Ensure that the legacy file paths are accessible to the wifi module (sepolicy rules, file
     * permissions, etc). Since the wifi service continues to run inside system_server process, this
     * method will be called from the same context (so ideally the file should still be accessible).
     * </li>
