     * Gets the events that happened after the last
     * {@link AutofillService#onFillRequest(FillRequest, android.os.CancellationSignal, FillCallback)}
     * call.
     *
     * <p>This method is typically used to keep track of previous user actions to optimize further
     * requests. For example, the service might return email addresses in alphabetical order by
     * default, but change that order based on the address the user picked on previous requests.
     *
     * <p>The history is not persisted over reboots, and it's cleared every time the service
     * replies to a {@link #onFillRequest(FillRequest, CancellationSignal, FillCallback)} by calling
     * {@link FillCallback#onSuccess(FillResponse)} or {@link FillCallback#onFailure(CharSequence)}
     * (if the service doesn't call any of these methods, the history will clear out after some
     * pre-defined time). Hence, the service should call {@link #getFillEventHistory()} before
     * finishing the {@link FillCallback}.
     *
     * @return The history or {@code null} if there are no events.
     *
     * @throws RuntimeException if the event history could not be retrieved.
