     * Map logicalSlot to physicalSlot, and activate the physicalSlot if it is inactive. For
     * example, passing the physicalSlots array [1, 0] means mapping the first item 1, which is
     * physical slot index 1, to the logical slot 0; and mapping the second item 0, which is
     * physical slot index 0, to the logical slot 1. The index of the array means the index of the
     * logical slots.
     *
     * @param physicalSlots The content of the array represents the physical slot index. The array
     *        size should be same as {@link #getUiccSlotsInfo()}.
     * @return boolean Return true if the switch succeeds, false if the switch fails.
