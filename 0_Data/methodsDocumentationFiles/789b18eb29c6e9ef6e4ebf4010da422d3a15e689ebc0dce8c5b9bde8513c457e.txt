     * Requests all available cell information from all radios on the device including the
     * camped/registered, serving, and neighboring cells.
     *
     * <p>The response can include one or more {@link android.telephony.CellInfoGsm CellInfoGsm},
     * {@link android.telephony.CellInfoCdma CellInfoCdma},
     * {@link android.telephony.CellInfoTdscdma CellInfoTdscdma},
     * {@link android.telephony.CellInfoLte CellInfoLte}, and
     * {@link android.telephony.CellInfoWcdma CellInfoWcdma} objects, in any combination.
     * It is typical to see instances of one or more of any these in the list. In addition, zero
     * or more of the returned objects may be considered registered; that is, their
     * {@link android.telephony.CellInfo#isRegistered CellInfo.isRegistered()}
     * methods may return true, indicating that the cell is being used or would be used for
     * signaling communication if necessary.
     *
     * <p>Beginning with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q Android Q},
     * if this API results in a change of the cached CellInfo, that change will be reported via
     * {@link android.telephony.PhoneStateListener#onCellInfoChanged onCellInfoChanged()}.
     *
     * <p>Apps targeting {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q Android Q} or higher will no
     * longer trigger a refresh of the cached CellInfo by invoking this API. Instead, those apps
     * will receive the latest cached results, which may not be current. Apps targeting
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q Android Q} or higher that wish to request updated
     * CellInfo should call
     * {@link android.telephony.TelephonyManager#requestCellInfoUpdate requestCellInfoUpdate()};
     * however, in all cases, updates will be rate-limited and are not guaranteed. To determine the
     * recency of CellInfo data, callers should check
     * {@link android.telephony.CellInfo#getTimeStamp CellInfo#getTimeStamp()}.
     *
     * <p>This method returns valid data for devices with
     * {@link android.content.pm.PackageManager#FEATURE_TELEPHONY FEATURE_TELEPHONY}. In cases
     * where only partial information is available for a particular CellInfo entry, unavailable
     * fields will be reported as {@link android.telephony.CellInfo#UNAVAILABLE}. All reported
     * cells will include at least a valid set of technology-specific identification info and a
     * power level measurement.
     *
     * <p>This method is preferred over using {@link
     * android.telephony.TelephonyManager#getCellLocation getCellLocation()}.
     *
     * @return List of {@link android.telephony.CellInfo}; null if cell
     * information is unavailable.
