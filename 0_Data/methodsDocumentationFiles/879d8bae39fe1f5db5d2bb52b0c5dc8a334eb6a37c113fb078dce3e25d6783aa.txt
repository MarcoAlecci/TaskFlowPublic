     * Records the functor specified with the drawGLFunction function pointer. This is
     * functionality used by webview for calling into their renderer from our display lists.
     *
     * @param drawGLFunctor A native function pointer
     * @param releasedCallback Called when the display list is destroyed, and thus
     * the functor is no longer referenced by this canvas's display list.
     *
     * NOTE: The callback does *not* necessarily mean that there are no longer
     * any references to the functor, just that the reference from this specific
     * canvas's display list has been released.
     *
     * @hide
     * @deprecated Use {@link #drawWebViewFunctor(int)}
