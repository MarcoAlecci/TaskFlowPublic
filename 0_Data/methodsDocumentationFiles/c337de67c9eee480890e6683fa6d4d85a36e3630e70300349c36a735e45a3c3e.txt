     * Check if this LensShadingMap is equal to another LensShadingMap.
     *
     * <p>Two lens shading maps are equal if and only if they have the same rows/columns,
     * and all of their elements are {@link Object#equals equal}.</p>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the objects were equal, {@code false} otherwise
