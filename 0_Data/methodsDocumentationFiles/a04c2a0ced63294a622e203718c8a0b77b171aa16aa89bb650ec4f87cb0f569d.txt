     * Helper for setFlags(), setting or clearing the DITHER_FLAG bit
     * Dithering affects how colors that are higher precision than the device
     * are down-sampled. No dithering is generally faster, but higher precision
     * colors are just truncated down (e.g. 8888 -> 565). Dithering tries to
     * distribute the error inherent in this process, to reduce the visual
     * artifacts.
     *
     * @param dither true to set the dithering bit in flags, false to clear it
