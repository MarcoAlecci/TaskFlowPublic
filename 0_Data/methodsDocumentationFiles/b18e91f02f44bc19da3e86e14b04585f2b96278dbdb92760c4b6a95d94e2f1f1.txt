         * Determine if the {@code sha256Certificate} certificate hash corresponds to a signing
         * certificate in this SigningDetails' signing certificate history, including the current
         * signer, and whether or not it has the given permission.  Certificates which match our
         * current signer automatically get all capabilities. Automatically returns false if this
         * object has multiple signing certificates, since rotation is only supported for
         * single-signers.
