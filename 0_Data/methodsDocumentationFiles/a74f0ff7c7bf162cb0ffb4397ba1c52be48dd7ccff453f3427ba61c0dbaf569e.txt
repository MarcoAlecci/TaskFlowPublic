     * Creates a read-only mapping of the entire shared memory region. This requires the the
     * protection level of the shared memory is at least PROT_READ or the map will fail.
     *
     * Use {@link #map(int, int, int)} to have more control over the mapping if desired.
     * This is equivalent to map(OsConstants.PROT_READ, 0, getSize())
     *
     * @return A ByteBuffer mapping
     * @throws ErrnoException if the mmap call failed.
