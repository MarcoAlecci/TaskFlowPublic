     * <p> For applications targeting {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q} or above,
     * {@code path} must be within directories owned by the application
     * {e.g. {@link Context#getExternalFilesDir(String)}} or if the application is running under
     * the legacy storage model (see
     * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestApplication_requestLegacyExternalStorage
     * android:requestLegacyExternalStorage}), {@code path} can also be within the top-level
     * Downloads directory (as returned by
     * {@link Environment#getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(String)} with
     * {@link Environment#DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS}).
     *
     * {@hide}

     * @deprecated Apps should instead contribute files to
     * {@link android.provider.MediaStore.Downloads} collection to make them available to user
     * as part of Downloads.
