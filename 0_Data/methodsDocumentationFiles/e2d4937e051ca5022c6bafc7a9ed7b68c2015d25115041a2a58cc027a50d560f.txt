     * Encrypts or decrypts data in a single-part operation, or finishes a
     * multiple-part operation. The data is encrypted or decrypted,
     * depending on how this cipher was initialized.
     *
     * <p>All <code>input.remaining()</code> bytes starting at
     * <code>input.position()</code> are processed.
     * If an AEAD mode such as GCM/CCM is being used, the authentication
     * tag is appended in the case of encryption, or verified in the
     * case of decryption.
     * The result is stored in the output buffer.
     * Upon return, the input buffer's position will be equal
     * to its limit; its limit will not have changed. The output buffer's
     * position will have advanced by n, where n is the value returned
     * by this method; the output buffer's limit will not have changed.
     *
     * <p>If <code>output.remaining()</code> bytes are insufficient to
     * hold the result, a <code>ShortBufferException</code> is thrown.
     * In this case, repeat this call with a larger output buffer. Use
     * {@link #getOutputSize(int) getOutputSize} to determine how big
     * the output buffer should be.
     *
     * <p>Upon finishing, this method resets this cipher object to the state
     * it was in when previously initialized via a call to <code>init</code>.
     * That is, the object is reset and available to encrypt or decrypt
     * (depending on the operation mode that was specified in the call to
     * <code>init</code>) more data.
     *
     * <p>Note: if any exception is thrown, this cipher object may need to
     * be reset before it can be used again.
     *
     * <p>Note: this method should be copy-safe, which means the
     * <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> buffers can reference
     * the same byte array and no unprocessed input data is overwritten
     * when the result is copied into the output buffer.

     * @exception ReadOnlyBufferException if the output buffer is read-only
     * @exception IllegalBlockSizeException if this cipher is a block cipher,

     * input length of the data processed by this cipher is not a multiple of

     * process the input data provided.
     * @exception ShortBufferException if there is insufficient space in the
     * output buffer
     * @exception BadPaddingException if this cipher is in decryption mode,

     * bounded by the appropriate padding bytes
     * @exception AEADBadTagException if this cipher is decrypting in an
     * AEAD mode (such as GCM/CCM), and the received authentication tag
     * does not match the calculated value
