     * Begin observation of UEvents.<p>
     * This method will cause the UEvent thread to start if this is the first
     * invocation of startObserving in this process.<p>
     * Once called, the UEvent thread will call onUEvent() when an incoming
     * UEvent matches the specified string.<p>
     * This method can be called multiple times to register multiple matches.
     * Only one call to stopObserving is required even with multiple registered
     * matches.
     *
     * @param match A substring of the UEvent to match.  Try to be as specific
     * as possible to avoid incurring unintended additional cost from processing
     * irrelevant messages.  Netlink messages can be moderately high bandwidth and
     * are expensive to parse.  For example, some devices may send one netlink message
     * for each vsync period.
