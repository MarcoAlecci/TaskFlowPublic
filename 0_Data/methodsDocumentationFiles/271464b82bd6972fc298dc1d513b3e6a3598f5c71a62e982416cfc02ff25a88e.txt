     * Set a callback on successful Android Beam (TM).
     *
     * <p>This method may be called at any time before {@link Activity#onDestroy},
     * but the callback can only occur when the
     * specified activity(s) are in resumed (foreground) state. The recommended
     * approach is to call this method during your Activity's
     * {@link Activity#onCreate} - see sample
     * code below. This method does not immediately perform any I/O or blocking work,
     * so is safe to call on your main thread.
     *
     * <p>The API allows for multiple activities to be specified at a time,
     * but it is strongly recommended to just register one at a time,
     * and to do so during the activity's {@link Activity#onCreate}. For example:
     * <pre>
     * protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     *     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
     *     NfcAdapter nfcAdapter = NfcAdapter.getDefaultAdapter(this);
     *     if (nfcAdapter == null) return;  // NFC not available on this device
     *     nfcAdapter.setOnNdefPushCompleteCallback(callback, this);
     * }</pre>
     * And that is it. Only one call per activity is necessary. The Android
     * OS will automatically release its references to the callback and the
     * Activity object when it is destroyed if you follow this pattern.
     *
     * <p class="note">Do not pass in an Activity that has already been through
     * {@link Activity#onDestroy}. This is guaranteed if you call this API
     * during {@link Activity#onCreate}.
     *
     * <p class="note">Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#NFC} permission.
     *
     * @param callback callback, or null to disable
     * @param activity activity for which the NDEF message will be pushed
     * @param activities optional additional activities, however we strongly recommend
     *        to only register one at a time, and to do so in that activity's
     *        {@link Activity#onCreate}
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if FEATURE_NFC is unavailable.
     * @deprecated this feature is deprecated. File sharing can work using other technology like
     * Bluetooth.
