     * Returns the number of underrun occurrences in the application-level write buffer
     * since the AudioTrack was created.
     * An underrun occurs if the application does not write audio
     * data quickly enough, causing the buffer to underflow
     * and a potential audio glitch or pop.
     * <p>
     * Underruns are less likely when buffer sizes are large.
     * It may be possible to eliminate underruns by recreating the AudioTrack with
     * a larger buffer.
     * Or by using {@link #setBufferSizeInFrames(int)} to dynamically increase the
     * effective size of the buffer.
