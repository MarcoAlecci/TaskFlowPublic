     * Create and return the view hierarchy used for the input area (such as
     * a soft keyboard).  This will be called once, when the input area is
     * first displayed.  You can return null to have no input area; the default
     * implementation returns null.
     * 
     * <p>To control when the input view is displayed, implement
     * {@link #onEvaluateInputViewShown()}.
     * To change the input view after the first one is created by this
     * function, use {@link #setInputView(View)}.
