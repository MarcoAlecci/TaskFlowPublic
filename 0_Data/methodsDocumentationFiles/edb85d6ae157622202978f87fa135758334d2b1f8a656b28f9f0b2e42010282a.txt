     * Add a new Intent data scheme to match against.  If any schemes are
     * included in the filter, then an Intent's data must be <em>either</em>
     * one of these schemes <em>or</em> a matching data type.  If no schemes
     * are included, then an Intent will match only if it includes no data.
     *
     * <p><em>Note: scheme matching in the Android framework is
     * case-sensitive, unlike formal RFC schemes.  As a result,
     * you should always write your schemes with lower case letters,
     * and any schemes you receive from outside of Android should be
     * converted to lower case before supplying them here.</em></p>
     *
     * @param scheme Name of the scheme to match, such as "http".
