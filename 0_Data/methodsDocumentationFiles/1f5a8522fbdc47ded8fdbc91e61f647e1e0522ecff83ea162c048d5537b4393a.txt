     * Hide the ActionBar if it is currently showing.
     * If the window hosting the ActionBar does not have the feature
     * {@link Window#FEATURE_ACTION_BAR_OVERLAY} it will resize application
     * content to fit the new space available.
     *
     * <p>Instead of calling this function directly, you can also cause an
     * ActionBar using the overlay feature to hide through
     * {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN}.
     * Hiding the ActionBar through this system UI flag allows you to more
     * seamlessly hide it in conjunction with other screen decorations.
