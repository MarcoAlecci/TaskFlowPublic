     * Override to find out when the window's requested system UI visibility
     * has changed, that is the value returned by {@link #getWindowSystemUiVisibility()}.
     * This is different from the callbacks received through
     * {@link #setOnSystemUiVisibilityChangeListener(OnSystemUiVisibilityChangeListener)}
     * in that this is only telling you about the local request of the window,
     * not the actual values applied by the system.
     *
     * @deprecated SystemUiVisibility flags are deprecated. Use {@link WindowInsetsController}
     * instead.
