     * Called by the framework to determine if the outgoing call, designated by the outgoing
     * {@link String}s, should be processed as an IMS call or CSFB call. If this method's
     * functionality is not overridden, the platform will process every call as IMS as long as the
     * MmTelFeature reports that the {@link MmTelCapabilities#CAPABILITY_TYPE_VOICE} capability is
     * available.
     * @param numbers An array of {@link String}s that will be used for placing the call. There can
     *         be multiple {@link String}s listed in the case when we want to place an outgoing
     *         call as a conference.
     * @return a {@link ProcessCallResult} to the framework, which will be used to determine if the
     *        call will be placed over IMS or via CSFB.
