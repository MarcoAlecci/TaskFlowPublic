     * Called when the Fragment's activity changes from fullscreen mode to multi-window mode and
     * visa-versa. This is generally tied to {@link Activity#onMultiWindowModeChanged} of the
     * containing Activity. This method provides the same configuration that will be sent in the
     * following {@link #onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)} call after the activity enters this
     * mode.
     *
     * @param isInMultiWindowMode True if the activity is in multi-window mode.
     * @param newConfig The new configuration of the activity with the state
     *                  {@param isInMultiWindowMode}.
