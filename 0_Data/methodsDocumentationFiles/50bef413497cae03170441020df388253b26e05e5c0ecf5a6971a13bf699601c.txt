     * Control whether a fragment instance is retained across Activity
     * re-creation (such as from a configuration change).  This can only
     * be used with fragments not in the back stack.  If set, the fragment
     * lifecycle will be slightly different when an activity is recreated:
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link #onDestroy()} will not be called (but {@link #onDetach()} still
     * will be, because the fragment is being detached from its current activity).
     * <li> {@link #onCreate(Bundle)} will not be called since the fragment
     * is not being re-created.
     * <li> {@link #onAttach(Activity)} and {@link #onActivityCreated(Bundle)} <b>will</b>
     * still be called.
     * </ul>
