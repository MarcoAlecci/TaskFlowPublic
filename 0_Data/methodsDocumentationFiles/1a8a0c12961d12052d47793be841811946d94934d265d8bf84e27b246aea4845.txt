         * Equivalent to reparent with a null parent, in that it removes
         * the SurfaceControl from the scene, but it also releases
         * the local resources (by calling {@link SurfaceControl#release})
         * after this method returns, {@link SurfaceControl#isValid} will return
         * false for the argument.
         *
         * @param sc The surface to remove and release.
