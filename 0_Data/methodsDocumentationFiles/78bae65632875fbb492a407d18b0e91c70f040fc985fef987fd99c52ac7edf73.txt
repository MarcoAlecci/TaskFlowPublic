     * (Usually optional) Normalize and set both the data Uri and an explicit
     * MIME data type.  This method should very rarely be used -- it allows you
     * to override the MIME type that would ordinarily be inferred from the
     * data with your own type given here.
     *
     * <p>The data Uri and the MIME type are normalize using
     * {@link android.net.Uri#normalizeScheme} and {@link #normalizeMimeType}
     * before they are set, so really this is just a convenience method for
     * <pre>
     * setDataAndType(data.normalize(), Intent.normalizeMimeType(type))
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param data The Uri of the data this intent is now targeting.
     * @param type The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.
     *
     * @return Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls
     * into a single statement.
