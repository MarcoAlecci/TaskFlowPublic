     * Query network usage statistics details for a given uid, tag, and state. Only usable for uids
     * belonging to calling user. Result is not aggregated over time. This means buckets' start and
     * end timestamps are going to be between 'startTime' and 'endTime' parameters. The uid is going
     * to be the same as the 'uid' parameter, the tag the same as the 'tag' parameter, and the state
     * the same as the 'state' parameter.
     * defaultNetwork is going to be {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#DEFAULT_NETWORK_ALL},
     * metered is going to be {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#METERED_ALL}, and
     * roaming is going to be {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#ROAMING_ALL}.
     * <p>Only includes buckets that atomically occur in the inclusive time range. Doesn't
     * interpolate across partial buckets. Since bucket length is in the order of hours, this
     * method cannot be used to measure data usage on a fine grained time scale.

     * @param networkType As defined in {@link ConnectivityManager}, e.g.
     *            {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_MOBILE}, {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_WIFI}
     *            etc.
     * @param subscriberId If applicable, the subscriber id of the network interface.
     *                     <p>Starting with API level 29, the {@code subscriberId} is guarded by
     *                     additional restrictions. Calling apps that do not meet the new
     *                     requirements to access the {@code subscriberId} can provide a {@code
     *                     null} value when querying for the mobile network type to receive usage
     *                     for all mobile networks. For additional details see {@link
     *                     TelephonyManager#getSubscriberId()}.
     * @param startTime Start of period. Defined in terms of "Unix time", see
     *            {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis}.
     * @param endTime End of period. Defined in terms of "Unix time", see
     *            {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis}.
     * @param uid UID of app
     * @param tag TAG of interest. Use {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#TAG_NONE} for no tags.
     * @param state state of interest. Use {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#STATE_ALL} to aggregate
     *            traffic from all states.
     * @return Statistics object or null if an error happened during statistics collection.
     * @throws SecurityException if permissions are insufficient to read network statistics.
