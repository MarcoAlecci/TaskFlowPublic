     * Request unbuffered dispatch of the given event source class to this view.
     * This is similar to {@link View#requestUnbufferedDispatch(MotionEvent)}, but does not
     * automatically terminate, and allows the specification of arbitrary input source classes.
     *
     * @param source The combined input source class to request unbuffered dispatch for. All
     *               events coming from these source classes will not be buffered. Set to
     *               {@link InputDevice#SOURCE_CLASS_NONE} in order to return to default behaviour.
     *
     * @see View#requestUnbufferedDispatch(MotionEvent)
