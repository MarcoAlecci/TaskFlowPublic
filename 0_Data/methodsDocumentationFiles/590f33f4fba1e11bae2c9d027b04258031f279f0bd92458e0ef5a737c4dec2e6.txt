     * Get a singleton {@link ControlTemplate}, which supports no direct user input.
     *
     * Used by {@link Control.StatelessBuilder} when there is no known state. Can also be used
     * in {@link Control.StatefulBuilder} for conveying information to a user about the
     * {@link Control} but direct user interaction is not desired. Since this template has no
     * corresponding {@link ControlAction}, any user interaction will launch the
     * {@link Control#getAppIntent()}.
     *
     * @return a singleton {@link ControlTemplate} to indicate no specific template is used by
     *         this {@link Control}
