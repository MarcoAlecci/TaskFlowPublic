     * Called when the view should apply {@link WindowInsets} according to its internal policy.
     *
     * <p>This method should be overridden by views that wish to apply a policy different from or
     * in addition to the default behavior. Clients that wish to force a view subtree
     * to apply insets should call {@link #dispatchApplyWindowInsets(WindowInsets)}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Clients may supply an {@link OnApplyWindowInsetsListener} to a view. If one is set
     * it will be called during dispatch instead of this method. The listener may optionally
     * call this method from its own implementation if it wishes to apply the view's default
     * insets policy in addition to its own.</p>
     *
     * <p>Implementations of this method should either return the insets parameter unchanged
     * or a new {@link WindowInsets} cloned from the supplied insets with any insets consumed
     * that this view applied itself. This allows new inset types added in future platform
     * versions to pass through existing implementations unchanged without being erroneously
     * consumed.</p>
     *
     * <p>By default if a view's {@link #setFitsSystemWindows(boolean) fitsSystemWindows}
     * property is set then the view will consume the system window insets and apply them
     * as padding for the view.</p>
     *
     * @param insets Insets to apply
     * @return The supplied insets with any applied insets consumed
