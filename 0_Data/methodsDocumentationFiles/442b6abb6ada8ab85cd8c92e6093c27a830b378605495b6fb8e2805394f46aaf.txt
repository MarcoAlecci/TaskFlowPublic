             * can help you detect places that your app is inadvertently sending cleartext data

             * <p>Using {@link #penaltyDeath()} or {@link #penaltyDeathOnCleartextNetwork()} will
             * block further traffic on that socket to prevent accidental data leakage, in addition
             * to crashing your process.
             *
             * <p>Using {@link #penaltyDropBox()} will log the raw contents of the packet that
             * triggered the violation.
             *
             * <p>This inspects both IPv4/IPv6 and TCP/UDP network traffic, but it may be subject to
             * false positives, such as when STARTTLS protocols or HTTP proxies are used.
