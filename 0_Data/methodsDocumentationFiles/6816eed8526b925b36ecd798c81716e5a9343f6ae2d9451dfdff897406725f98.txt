     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} whose value is {@code this / divisor}.
     * As scale of the result the parameter {@code scale} is used. If rounding
     * is required to meet the specified scale, then the specified rounding mode
     * {@code roundingMode} is applied.
     *
     * @param divisor
     *            value by which {@code this} is divided.
     * @param scale
     *            the scale of the result returned.
     * @param roundingMode
     *            rounding mode to be used to round the result.
     * @return {@code this / divisor} rounded according to the given rounding
     *         mode.
     * @throws NullPointerException
     *             if {@code divisor == null} or {@code roundingMode == null}.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code divisor == 0}.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code roundingMode == RoundingMode.UNNECESSAR}Y and
     *             rounding is necessary according to the given scale and given
     *             precision.
