     * Pin shortcuts on a package.
     *
     * <p>This API is <b>NOT</b> cumulative; this will replace all pinned shortcuts for the package.
     * However, different launchers may have different set of pinned shortcuts.
     *
     * <p>The calling launcher application must be allowed to access the shortcut information,
     * as defined in {@link #hasShortcutHostPermission()}.
     *
     * @param packageName The target package name.
     * @param shortcutIds The IDs of the shortcut to be pinned.
     * @param user The UserHandle of the profile.
     * @throws IllegalStateException when the user is locked, or when the {@code user} user
     * is locked or not running.
