     * @deprecated This is a now a no-op, use
     * {@link #startForeground(int, Notification)} instead.  This method
     * has been turned into a no-op rather than simply being deprecated
     * because analysis of numerous poorly behaving devices has shown that
     * increasingly often the trouble is being caused in part by applications
     * that are abusing it.  Thus, given a choice between introducing
     * problems in existing applications using this API (by allowing them to
     * be killed when they would like to avoid it), vs allowing the performance
     * of the entire system to be decreased, this method was deemed less
     * important.
