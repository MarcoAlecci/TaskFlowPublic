     * Provides the framework with an update as to whether or not a command completed successfully
     * locally. This includes capabilities requests and updates from the network. If it does not
     * complete successfully, then the framework may retry the command again later, depending on the
     * error. If the command does complete successfully, the framework will then wait for network
     * updates.
     *
     * @param code The result of the pending command. If {@link #COMMAND_CODE_SUCCESS}, further
     *             updates will be sent for this command using the associated operationToken.
     * @param operationToken the token associated with the pending command.
     * @throws ImsException If this {@link RcsCapabilityExchange} instance is not currently
     * connected to the framework. This can happen if the {@link RcsFeature} is not
     * {@link ImsFeature#STATE_READY} and the {@link RcsFeature} has not received the
     * {@link ImsFeature#onFeatureReady()} callback. This may also happen in rare cases when the
     * Telephony stack has crashed.
