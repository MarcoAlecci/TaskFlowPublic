     * Gets the GNSS measurement's satellite inter-signal bias in nanoseconds with sub-nanosecond
     * accuracy.
     *
     * <p>This value is the space-segment-side inter-system bias, inter-frequency bias and
     * inter-code bias, including:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Master clock bias (e.g., GPS-GAL Time Offset (GGTO), GPS-UTC Time Offset (TauGps),
     * BDS-GLO Time Offset (BGTO))(with respect to the constellation in
     * {@link GnssClock#getReferenceConstellationTypeForIsb())</li>
     * <li>Group delay (e.g., Total Group Delay (TGD))</li>
     * <li>Satellite inter-frequency bias (GLO only) (with respect to the carrier frequency in
     * {@link GnssClock#getReferenceConstellationTypeForIsb())</li>
     * <li>Satellite inter-code bias (e.g., Differential Code Bias (DCB)) (with respect to the code
     * type in {@link GnssClock#getReferenceConstellationTypeForIsb())</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasSatelliteInterSignalBiasNanos()} is {@code
     * true}.
