     * Sets the order in which Transition matches View start and end values.
     * <p>
     * The default behavior is to match first by {@link android.view.View#getTransitionName()},
     * then by View instance, then by {@link android.view.View#getId()} and finally
     * by its item ID if it is in a direct child of ListView. The caller can
     * choose to have only some or all of the values of {@link #MATCH_INSTANCE},
     * {@link #MATCH_NAME}, {@link #MATCH_ITEM_ID}, and {@link #MATCH_ID}. Only
     * the match algorithms supplied will be used to determine whether Views are the
     * the same in both the start and end Scene. Views that do not match will be considered
     * as entering or leaving the Scene.
     * </p>
     * @param matches A list of zero or more of {@link #MATCH_INSTANCE},
     *                {@link #MATCH_NAME}, {@link #MATCH_ITEM_ID}, and {@link #MATCH_ID}.
     *                If none are provided, then the default match order will be set.
