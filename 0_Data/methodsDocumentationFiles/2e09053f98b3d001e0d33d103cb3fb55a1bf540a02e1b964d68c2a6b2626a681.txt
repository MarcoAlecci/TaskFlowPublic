         * Indicates whether the notification associated with the bubble is being visually
         * suppressed from the notification shade. When <code>true</code> the notification is
         * hidden, when <code>false</code> the notification shows as normal.
         *
         * <p>Apps sending bubbles may set this flag so that the bubble is posted <b>without</b>
         * the associated notification in the notification shade.</p>
         *
         * <p>Apps sending bubbles can only apply this flag when the app is in the foreground,
         * otherwise the flag is not respected. The app is considered foreground if it is visible
         * and on the screen, note that a foreground service does not qualify.</p>
         *
         * <p>Generally the app should only set this flag if the user has performed an
         * action to request or create a bubble, or if the user has seen the content in the
         * notification and the notification is no longer relevant. </p>
         *
         * <p>The system will update this flag with <code>true</code> to hide the notification
         * from the user once the bubble has been expanded.</p>

         * @return whether this bubble should suppress the notification when it is posted.
