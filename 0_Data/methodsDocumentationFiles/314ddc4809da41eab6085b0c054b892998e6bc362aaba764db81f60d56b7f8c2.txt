     * Enable or disable special cache behavior that leaves deleted cache files
     * intact as tombstones.
     * <p>
     * When enabled and a file contained in this directory is automatically
     * deleted by the OS, the file will be truncated to have a length of 0 bytes
     * instead of being fully deleted. This is useful if you need to distinguish
     * between a file that was deleted versus one that never existed.
     * <p>
     * This behavior can only be set on a directory, and it applies recursively
     * to all contained files and directories.
     * <p class="note">
     * Note: this behavior is ignored completely if the user explicitly requests
     * that all cached data be cleared.
     * </p>
