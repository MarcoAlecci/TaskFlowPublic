     * Compares the two specified {@code double} values. The sign

     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   d1        the first {@code double} to compare
     * @param   d2        the second {@code double} to compare
     * @return  the value {@code 0} if {@code d1} is
     *          numerically equal to {@code d2}; a value less than
     *          {@code 0} if {@code d1} is numerically less than
     *          {@code d2}; and a value greater than {@code 0}
     *          if {@code d1} is numerically greater than
     *          {@code d2}.
