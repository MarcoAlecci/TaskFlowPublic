     * Returns a new bit set containing all the bits in the given byte
     * buffer between its position and limit.
     *
     * <p>More precisely,
     * <br>{@code BitSet.valueOf(bb).get(n) == ((bb.get(bb.position()+n/8) & (1<<(n%8))) != 0)}
     * <br>for all {@code n < 8 * bb.remaining()}.
     *
     * <p>The byte buffer is not modified by this method, and no
     * reference to the buffer is retained by the bit set.
     *
     * @param bb a byte buffer containing a little-endian representation
     *        of a sequence of bits between its position and limit, to be
     *        used as the initial bits of the new bit set
     * @return a {@code BitSet} containing all the bits in the buffer in the
     *         specified range
     * @since 1.7
