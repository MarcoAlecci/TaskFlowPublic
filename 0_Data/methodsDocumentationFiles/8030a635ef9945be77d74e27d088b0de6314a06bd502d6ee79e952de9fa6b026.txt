     * Returns {@code true} if the key must be encrypted at rest. This will protect the key pair
     * with the secure lock screen credential (e.g., password, PIN, or pattern).
     *
     * <p>Note that encrypting the key at rest requires that the secure lock screen (e.g., password,
     * PIN, pattern) is set up, otherwise key generation will fail. Moreover, this key will be
     * deleted when the secure lock screen is disabled or reset (e.g., by the user or a Device
     * Administrator). Finally, this key cannot be used until the user unlocks the secure lock
     * screen after boot.
