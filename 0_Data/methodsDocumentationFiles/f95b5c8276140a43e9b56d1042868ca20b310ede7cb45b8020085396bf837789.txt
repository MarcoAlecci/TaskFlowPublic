     * Notifies this Connection of a {@link Call} event initiated from an {@link InCallService}.
     * <p>
     * The {@link InCallService} issues a Call event via {@link Call#sendCallEvent(String, Bundle)}.
     * <p>
     * Where possible, the Connection should make an attempt to handle {@link Call} events which
     * are part of the {@code android.telecom.*} namespace.  The Connection should ignore any events
     * it does not wish to handle.  Unexpected events should be handled gracefully, as it is
     * possible that a {@link InCallService} has defined its own Call events which a Connection is
     * not aware of.
     * <p>
     * See also {@link Call#sendCallEvent(String, Bundle)}.
     *
     * @param event The call event.
     * @param extras Extras associated with the call event.
