         * displaying the text (which is needed to avoid text from consecutive lines running into
         * each other). If set, fallback fonts that end up getting used can increase the ascent
         * and descent of the lines that they are used on.
         *
         * <p>For backward compatibility reasons, the default is {@code false}, but setting this to
         * true is strongly recommended. It is required to be true if text could be in languages
         * like Burmese or Tibetan where text is typically much taller or deeper than Latin text.
         *
         * @param useLineSpacingFromFallbacks whether to expand linespacing based on fallback fonts
         * @return this builder, useful for chaining
