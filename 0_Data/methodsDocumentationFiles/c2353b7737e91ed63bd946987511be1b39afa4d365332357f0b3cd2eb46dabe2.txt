     * Create a single use app specific incoming SMS request for the calling package.
     *
     * This method returns a token that if included in a subsequent incoming SMS message will cause
     * {@code intent} to be sent with the SMS data.
     *
     * The token is only good for one use, after an SMS has been received containing the token all
     * subsequent SMS messages with the token will be routed as normal.
     *
     * An app can only have one request at a time, if the app already has a request pending it will
     * be replaced with a new request.
     *
     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This method will never trigger an SMS disambiguation
     * dialog. If this method is called on a device that has multiple active subscriptions, this
     * {@link SmsManager} instance has been created with {@link #getDefault()}, and no user-defined
     * default subscription is defined, the subscription ID associated with this message will be
     * INVALID, which will result in the operation being completed on the subscription associated
     * with logical slot 0. Use {@link #getSmsManagerForSubscriptionId(int)} to ensure the
     * operation is performed on the correct subscription.
