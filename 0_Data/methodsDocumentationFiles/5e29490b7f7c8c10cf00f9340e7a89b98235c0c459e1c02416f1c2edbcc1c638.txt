     * Add a new Intent data path to match against.  The filter must
     * include one or more schemes (via {@link #addDataScheme}) <em>and</em>
     * one or more authorities (via {@link #addDataAuthority}) for the
     * path to be considered.  If any paths are
     * included in the filter, then an Intent's data must match one of
     * them.  If no paths are included, then only the scheme/authority must
     * match.
     *
     * <p>The path given here can either be a literal that must directly
     * match or match against a prefix, or it can be a simple globbing pattern.
     * If the latter, you can use '*' anywhere in the pattern to match zero
     * or more instances of the previous character, '.' as a wildcard to match
     * any character, and '\' to escape the next character.
     *
     * @param path Either a raw string that must exactly match the file
     * path, or a simple pattern, depending on <var>type</var>.
     * @param type Determines how <var>path</var> will be compared to
     * determine a match: either {@link PatternMatcher#PATTERN_LITERAL},
     * {@link PatternMatcher#PATTERN_PREFIX}, or
     * {@link PatternMatcher#PATTERN_SIMPLE_GLOB}.
