     * Localize and format the message string from a log record.  This
     * method is provided as a convenience for Formatter subclasses to
     * use when they are performing formatting.
     * <p>
     * The message string is first localized to a format string using
     * the record's ResourceBundle.  (If there is no ResourceBundle,
     * or if the message key is not found, then the key is used as the
     * format string.)  The format String uses java.text style
     * formatting.
     * <ul>
     * <li>If there are no parameters, no formatter is used.
     * <li>Otherwise, if the string contains "{0" then
     *     java.text.MessageFormat  is used to format the string.
     * <li>Otherwise no formatting is performed.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     *
     * @param  record  the log record containing the raw message
     * @return   a localized and formatted message
