     * Frees up the memory associated with this region decoder, and mark the
     * region decoder as "dead", meaning it will throw an exception if decodeRegion(),
     * getWidth() or getHeight() is called.
     *
     * <p>This operation cannot be reversed, so it should only be called if you are
     * sure there are no further uses for the region decoder. This is an advanced call,
     * and normally need not be called, since the normal GC process will free up this
     * memory when there are no more references to this region decoder.
