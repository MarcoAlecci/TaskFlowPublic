     * Sets a delegate for implementing accessibility support via composition
     * (as opposed to inheritance). For more details, see
     * {@link AccessibilityDelegate}.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> On platform versions prior to
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M API 23}, delegate methods on
     * views in the {@code android.widget.*} package are called <i>before</i>
     * host methods. This prevents certain properties such as class name from
     * being modified by overriding
     * {@link AccessibilityDelegate#onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(View, AccessibilityNodeInfo)},
     * as any changes will be overwritten by the host class.
     * <p>
     * Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M API 23}, delegate
     * methods are called <i>after</i> host methods, which all properties to be
     * modified without being overwritten by the host class.
     *
     * @param delegate the object to which accessibility method calls should be
     *                 delegated
