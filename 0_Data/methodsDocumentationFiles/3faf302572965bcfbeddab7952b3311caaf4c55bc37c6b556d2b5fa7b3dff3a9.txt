     * Register a callback to be invoked when a new image frame becomes available to the
     * SurfaceTexture.
     * <p>
     * If a handler is specified, the callback will be invoked on that handler's thread.
     * If no handler is specified, then the callback may be called on an arbitrary thread,
     * so it is not safe to call {@link #updateTexImage} without first binding the OpenGL ES
     * context to the thread invoking the callback.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param listener The listener to use, or null to remove the listener.
     * @param handler The handler on which the listener should be invoked, or null
     * to use an arbitrary thread.
