     * The time interpolator used in calculating the elapsed fraction of this animation. The
     * interpolator determines whether the animation runs with linear or non-linear motion,
     * such as acceleration and deceleration. The default value is
     * {@link android.view.animation.AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator}
     *
     * @param value the interpolator to be used by this animation. A value of <code>null</code>
     * will result in linear interpolation.
