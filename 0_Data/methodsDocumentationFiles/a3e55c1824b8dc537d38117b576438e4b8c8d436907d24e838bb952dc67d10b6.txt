     * If some part of this view is not clipped by any of its parents, then
     * return that area in r in global (root) coordinates. To convert r to local
     * coordinates (without taking possible View rotations into account), offset
     * it by -globalOffset (e.g. r.offset(-globalOffset.x, -globalOffset.y)).
     * If the view is completely clipped or translated out, return false.
     *
     * @param r If true is returned, r holds the global coordinates of the
     *        visible portion of this view.
     * @param globalOffset If true is returned, globalOffset holds the dx,dy
     *        between this view and its root. globalOffet may be null.
     * @return true if r is non-empty (i.e. part of the view is visible at the
     *         root level.
