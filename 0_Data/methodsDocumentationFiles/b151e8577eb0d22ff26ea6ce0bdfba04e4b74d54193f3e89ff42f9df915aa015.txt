     * Returns the mandatory system gesture insets.
     *
     * <p>The mandatory system gesture insets represent the area of a window where mandatory system
     * gestures have priority and may consume some or all touch input, e.g. due to the a system bar
     * occupying it, or it being reserved for touch-only gestures.
     *
     * <p>In contrast to {@link #getSystemGestureInsets regular system gestures}, <b>mandatory</b>
     * system gestures cannot be overriden by {@link View#setSystemGestureExclusionRects}.
     *
     * <p>Simple taps are guaranteed to reach the window even within the system gesture insets,
     * as long as they are outside the {@link #getTappableElementInsets() system window insets}.
     *
     * <p>When {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE} is requested, an inset will be returned
     * even when the system gestures are inactive due to
     * {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN} or
     * {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION}.
     *
     * <p>This inset is consumed together with the {@link #getSystemWindowInsets()
     * system window insets} by {@link #consumeSystemWindowInsets()}.
     *
     * @see #getSystemGestureInsets
     * @deprecated Use {@link #getInsets(int)} with {@link Type#mandatorySystemGestures()} instead.
