     * Poll for an {@link AudioTimestamp} on demand.
     * <p>
     * The AudioTimestamp reflects the frame delivery information at
     * the earliest point available in the capture pipeline.
     * <p>
     * Calling {@link #startRecording()} following a {@link #stop()} will reset
     * the frame count to 0.
     *
     * @param outTimestamp a caller provided non-null AudioTimestamp instance,
     *        which is updated with the AudioRecord frame delivery information upon success.
     * @param timebase one of
     *        {@link AudioTimestamp#TIMEBASE_BOOTTIME AudioTimestamp.TIMEBASE_BOOTTIME} or
     *        {@link AudioTimestamp#TIMEBASE_MONOTONIC AudioTimestamp.TIMEBASE_MONOTONIC},
     *        used to select the clock for the AudioTimestamp time.
     * @return {@link #SUCCESS} if a timestamp is available,
     *         or {@link #ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION} if a timestamp not available.
