     * Set the Bluetooth scan mode of the local Bluetooth adapter.
     * <p>The Bluetooth scan mode determines if the local adapter is
     * connectable and/or discoverable from remote Bluetooth devices.
     * <p>For privacy reasons, discoverable mode is automatically turned off
     * after <code>duration</code> seconds. For example, 120 seconds should be
     * enough for a remote device to initiate and complete its discovery
     * process.
     * <p>Valid scan mode values are:
     * {@link #SCAN_MODE_NONE},
     * {@link #SCAN_MODE_CONNECTABLE},
     * {@link #SCAN_MODE_CONNECTABLE_DISCOVERABLE}.
     * <p>If Bluetooth state is not {@link #STATE_ON}, this API
     * will return false. After turning on Bluetooth,
     * wait for {@link #ACTION_STATE_CHANGED} with {@link #STATE_ON}
     * to get the updated value.
     * <p>Applications cannot set the scan mode. They should use
     * <code>startActivityForResult(
     * BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_DISCOVERABLE})
     * </code>instead.
     *
     * @param mode valid scan mode
     * @return true if the scan mode was set, false otherwise
     * @hide
