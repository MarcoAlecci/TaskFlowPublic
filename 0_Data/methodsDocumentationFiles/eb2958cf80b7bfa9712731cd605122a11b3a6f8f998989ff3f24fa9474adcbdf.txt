     * Performs a control transaction on endpoint zero for this device.
     * The direction of the transfer is determined by the request type.
     * If requestType & {@link UsbConstants#USB_ENDPOINT_DIR_MASK} is
     * {@link UsbConstants#USB_DIR_OUT}, then the transfer is a write,
     * and if it is {@link UsbConstants#USB_DIR_IN}, then the transfer
     * is a read.
     * <p>
     * This method transfers data starting from index 0 in the buffer.
     * To specify a different offset, use
     * {@link #controlTransfer(int, int, int, int, byte[], int, int, int)}.
