     * Retrieves the connection start time of the {@link Conference}, if specified.  A value of
     * {@link #CONNECT_TIME_NOT_SPECIFIED} indicates that Telecom should determine the start time
     * of the conference.
     * <p>
     * This is based on the value of {@link SystemClock#elapsedRealtime()} to ensure that it is not
     * impacted by wall clock changes (user initiated, network initiated, time zone change, etc).
     * <p>
     * Note: This is only exposed for use by the Telephony framework which needs it to copy
     * conference start times among conference participants.  It is exposed as a system API since it
     * has no general use other than to the Telephony framework.
     *
     * @return The elapsed time at which the {@link Conference} was connected.
