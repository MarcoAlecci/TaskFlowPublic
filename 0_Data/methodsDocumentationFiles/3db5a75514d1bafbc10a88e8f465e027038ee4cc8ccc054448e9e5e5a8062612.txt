     * Applications who want to only use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can call enableBLE.
     *
     * enableBLE registers the existence of an app using only LE functions.
     *
     * enableBLE may enable Bluetooth to an LE only mode so that an app can use
     * LE related features (BluetoothGatt or BluetoothGattServer classes)
     *
     * If the user disables Bluetooth while an app is registered to use LE only features,
     * Bluetooth will remain on in LE only mode for the app.
     *
     * When Bluetooth is in LE only mode, it is not shown as ON to the UI.
     *
     * <p>This is an asynchronous call: it returns immediately, and
     * clients should listen for {@link #ACTION_BLE_STATE_CHANGED}
     * to be notified of adapter state changes.
     *
     * If this call returns * true, then the adapter state is either in a mode where
     * LE is available, or will transition from {@link #STATE_OFF} to {@link #STATE_BLE_TURNING_ON},
     * and some time later transition to either {@link #STATE_OFF} or {@link #STATE_BLE_ON}.
     *
     * If this call returns false then there was an immediate problem that prevents the
     * adapter from being turned on - such as Airplane mode.
     *
     * {@link #ACTION_BLE_STATE_CHANGED} returns the Bluetooth Adapter's various
     * states, It includes all the classic Bluetooth Adapter states along with
     * internal BLE only states
     *
     * @return true to indicate Bluetooth LE will be available, or false on immediate error
     * @hide
