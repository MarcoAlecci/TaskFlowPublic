     * This is where the invalidate() work actually happens. A full invalidate()
     * causes the drawing cache to be invalidated, but this function can be
     * called with invalidateCache set to false to skip that invalidation step
     * for cases that do not need it (for example, a component that remains at
     * the same dimensions with the same content).
     *
     * @param invalidateCache Whether the drawing cache for this view should be
     *            invalidated as well. This is usually true for a full
     *            invalidate, but may be set to false if the View's contents or
     *            dimensions have not changed.
     * @hide
