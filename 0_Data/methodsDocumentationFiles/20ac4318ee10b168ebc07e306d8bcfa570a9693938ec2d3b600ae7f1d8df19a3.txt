     * Set allowing mobile data during voice call. This is used for allowing data on the non-default
     * data SIM. When a voice call is placed on the non-default data SIM on DSDS devices, users will
     * not be able to use mobile data. By calling this API, data will be temporarily enabled on the
     * non-default data SIM during the life cycle of the voice call.
     *
     * @param allow {@code true} if allowing using data during voice call, {@code false} if
     * disallowed.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if operation is successful. otherwise {@code false}.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller doesn't have the permission.
