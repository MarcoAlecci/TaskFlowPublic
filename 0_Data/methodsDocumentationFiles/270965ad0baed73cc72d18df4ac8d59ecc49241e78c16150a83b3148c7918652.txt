     * Retrieve current operation state for one application. The UID and the
     * package must match.
     *
     * The mode of the ops returned are set for the package but may not reflect their effective
     * state due to UID policy or because it's controlled by a different master op.
     *
     * Use {@link #unsafeCheckOp(String, int, String)}} or
     * {@link #noteOp(String, int, String, String, String)} if the effective mode is needed.
     *
     * @param uid The uid of the application of interest.
     * @param packageName The name of the application of interest.
     * @param ops The set of operations you are interested in, or null if you want all of them.
