    * Determine if a given password is valid based off its lock type and expected complexity level.
    *
    * @param lockType - type of lock as specified in {@link LockTypes}
    * @param password - password to validate; this has the same encoding
    *        as the output of String#getBytes
    * @param complexity - complexity level imposed by the requester
    *        as defined in {@code DevicePolicyManager.PasswordComplexity}
    * @return true if the password is valid, false otherwise
    * @hide
