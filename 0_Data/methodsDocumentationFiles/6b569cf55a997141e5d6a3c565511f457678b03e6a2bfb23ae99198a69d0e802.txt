         * using a numeric address string. See {@link InetAddress} for the

         * Adding a server implicitly allows traffic from that address family
         * (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6) to be routed over the VPN. @see #allowFamily
         *
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the address is invalid.
         * @see #addDnsServer(InetAddress)
