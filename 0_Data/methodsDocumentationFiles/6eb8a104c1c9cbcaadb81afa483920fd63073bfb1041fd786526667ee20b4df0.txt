     * Create an ActivityOptions specifying an animation where a thumbnail
     * is scaled from a given position to the new activity window that is
     * being started.
     *
     * <p>If the Intent this is being used with has not set its
     * {@link android.content.Intent#setSourceBounds Intent.setSourceBounds},
     * those bounds will be filled in for you based on the initial
     * thumbnail location and size provided here.
     *
     * @param source The View that this thumbnail is animating from.  This
     * defines the coordinate space for <var>startX</var> and <var>startY</var>.
     * @param thumbnail The bitmap that will be shown as the initial thumbnail
     * of the animation.
     * @param startX The x starting location of the bitmap, relative to <var>source</var>.
     * @param startY The y starting location of the bitmap, relative to <var>source</var>.
     * @return Returns a new ActivityOptions object that you can use to
     * supply these options as the options Bundle when starting an activity.
