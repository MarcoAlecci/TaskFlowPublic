     * Factory method called by the Android framework to create new action views.
     * This method returns a new action view for the given MenuItem.
     *
     * <p>If your ActionProvider implementation overrides the deprecated no-argument overload
     * {@link #onCreateActionView()}, overriding this method for devices running API 16 or later
     * is recommended but optional. The default implementation calls {@link #onCreateActionView()}
     * for compatibility with applications written for older platform versions.</p>
