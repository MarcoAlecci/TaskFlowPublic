         * Set whether this notification should be colorized. When set, the color set with
         * {@link #setColor(int)} will be used as the background color of this notification.
         * <p>
         * This should only be used for high priority ongoing tasks like navigation, an ongoing
         * call, or other similarly high-priority events for the user.
         * <p>
         * For most styles, the coloring will only be applied if the notification is for a
         * foreground service notification.
         * However, for {@link MediaStyle} and {@link DecoratedMediaCustomViewStyle} notifications
         * that have a media session attached there is no such requirement.
