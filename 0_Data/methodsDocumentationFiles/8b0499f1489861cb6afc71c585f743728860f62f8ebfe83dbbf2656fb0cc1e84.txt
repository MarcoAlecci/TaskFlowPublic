     * used cautiously as once it is called it cannot be undone. The device owner can only be set as
     * a part of device setup, before it completes.
     * <p>
     * While some policies previously set by the device owner will be cleared by this method, it is
     * a best-effort process and some other policies will still remain in place after the device
     * owner is cleared.

     *
     * @deprecated This method is expected to be used for testing purposes only. The device owner
     * will lose control of the device and its data after calling it. In order to protect any
     * sensitive data that remains on the device, it is advised that the device owner factory resets
     * the device instead of calling this method. See {@link #wipeData(int)}.
