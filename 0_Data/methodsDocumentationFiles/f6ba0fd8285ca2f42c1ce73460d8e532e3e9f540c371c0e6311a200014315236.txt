     * Control whether this text view saves its entire text contents when
     * freezing to an icicle, in addition to dynamic state such as cursor
     * position.  By default this is false, not saving the text.  Set to true
     * if the text in the text view is not being saved somewhere else in
     * persistent storage (such as in a content provider) so that if the
     * view is later thawed the user will not lose their data. For
     * {@link android.widget.EditText} it is always enabled, regardless of
     * the value of the attribute.
     *
     * @param freezesText Controls whether a frozen icicle should include the
     * entire text data: true to include it, false to not.
