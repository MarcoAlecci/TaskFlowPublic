     * Create an ActivityOptions specifying an animation where the new activity
     * window and a thumbnail is aspect-scaled to a new location.
     *
     * @param source The View that this thumbnail is animating to.  This
     * defines the coordinate space for <var>startX</var> and <var>startY</var>.
     * @param thumbnail The bitmap that will be shown as the final thumbnail
     * of the animation.
     * @param startX The x end location of the bitmap, relative to <var>source</var>.
     * @param startY The y end location of the bitmap, relative to <var>source</var>.
     * @param handler If <var>listener</var> is non-null this must be a valid
     * Handler on which to dispatch the callback; otherwise it should be null.
     * @param listener Optional OnAnimationStartedListener to find out when the
     * requested animation has started running.  If for some reason the animation
     * is not executed, the callback will happen immediately.
     * @return Returns a new ActivityOptions object that you can use to
     * supply these options as the options Bundle when starting an activity.
     * @hide
