     * Called by device owner or delegated app with {@link #DELEGATION_NETWORK_LOGGING} to retrieve
     * the most recent batch of network logging events.
     * A device owner has to provide a batchToken provided as part of
     * {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#onNetworkLogsAvailable} callback. If the token doesn't match the
     * token of the most recent available batch of logs, {@code null} will be returned.
     *
     * <p> {@link NetworkEvent} can be one of {@link DnsEvent} or {@link ConnectEvent}.
     *
     * <p> The list of network events is sorted chronologically, and contains at most 1200 events.
     *
     * <p> Access to the logs is rate limited and this method will only return a new batch of logs
     * after the device device owner has been notified via
     * {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#onNetworkLogsAvailable}.
     *
     * <p>If a secondary user or profile is created, calling this method will throw a
     * {@link SecurityException} until all users become affiliated again. It will also no longer be
     * possible to retrieve the network logs batch with the most recent batchToken provided
     * by {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#onNetworkLogsAvailable}. See
     * {@link DevicePolicyManager#setAffiliationIds}.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or
     *        {@code null} if called by a delegated app.
     * @param batchToken A token of the batch to retrieve
     * @return A new batch of network logs which is a list of {@link NetworkEvent}. Returns
     *        {@code null} if the batch represented by batchToken is no longer available or if
     *        logging is disabled.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device owner, or there is at least one
     * profile or secondary user that is not affiliated with the device.
