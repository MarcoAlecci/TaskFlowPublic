     * this method; if it has not, a security exception will be thrown.
     * Only the first device admin can set the proxy. If a second admin attempts
     * to set the proxy, the {@link ComponentName} of the admin originally setting the
     * proxy will be returned. If successful in setting the proxy, {@code null} will
     * be returned.
     * The method can be called repeatedly by the device admin alrady setting the
     * proxy to update the proxy and exclusion list.
