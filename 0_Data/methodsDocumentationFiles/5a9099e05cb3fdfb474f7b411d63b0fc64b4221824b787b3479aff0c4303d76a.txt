     * You can call this to try to enable accelerated drawing for your IME. This must be set before
     * {@link #onCreate()}, so you will typically call it in your constructor.  It is not always
     * possible to use hardware accelerated drawing in an IME (for example on low-end devices that
     * do not have the resources to support this), so the call {@code true} if it succeeds otherwise
     * {@code false} if you will need to draw in software.  You must be able to handle either case.
     *
     * <p>In API 21 and later, system may automatically enable hardware accelerated drawing for your
     * IME on capable devices even if this method is not explicitly called. Make sure that your IME
     * is able to handle either case.</p>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if accelerated drawing is successfully enabled otherwise {@code false}.
     *         On API 21 and later devices the return value is basically just a hint and your IME
     *         does not need to change the behavior based on the it
     * @deprecated Starting in API 21, hardware acceleration is always enabled on capable devices
