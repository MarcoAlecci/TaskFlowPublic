     * Terminate search UI.
     *
     * <p>Typically the user will terminate the search UI by launching a
     * search or by canceling.  This function allows the underlying application
     * or activity to cancel the search prematurely (for any reason).
     *
     * <p>This function can be safely called at any time (even if no search is active.)
     *
     * <p>{@link Configuration#UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION} does not support this method.
