     * Receives a datagram packet from this socket. When this method
     * returns, the {@code DatagramPacket}'s buffer is filled with
     * the data received. The datagram packet also contains the sender's
     * IP address, and the port number on the sender's machine.
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until a datagram is received. The
     * {@code length} field of the datagram packet object contains
     * the length of the received message. If the message is longer than
     * the packet's length, the message is truncated.
     * <p>
     * If there is a security manager, a packet cannot be received if the
     * security manager's {@code checkAccept} method
     * does not allow it.

     * @param      p   the {@code DatagramPacket} into which to place
     *                 the incoming data.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
     * @exception  SocketTimeoutException  if setSoTimeout was previously called
     *                 and the timeout has expired.
     * @exception  PortUnreachableException may be thrown if the socket is connected
     *             to a currently unreachable destination. Note, there is no guarantee that the
     *             exception will be thrown.
     * @exception  java.nio.channels.IllegalBlockingModeException
     *             if this socket has an associated channel,
     *             and the channel is in non-blocking mode.
