     * <p>
     * Generally, the ImageReader caches buffers for reuse once they have been
     * allocated, for best performance. However, sometimes it may be important to
     * release all the cached, unused buffers to save on memory.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Calling this method will discard all free cached buffers. This does not include any buffers
     * associated with Images acquired from the ImageReader, any filled buffers waiting to be
     * acquired, and any buffers currently in use by the source rendering buffers into the
     * ImageReader's Surface.
     * <p>
     * The ImageReader continues to be usable after this call, but may need to reallocate buffers
     * when more buffers are needed for rendering.
     * </p>
