     * Create a Bluetooth L2CAP Connection-oriented Channel (CoC) {@link BluetoothSocket} that can
     * be used to start a secure outgoing connection to the remote device with the same dynamic
     * protocol/service multiplexer (PSM) value. The supported Bluetooth transport is LE only.
     * <p>This is designed to be used with {@link BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingL2capChannel()} for
     * peer-peer Bluetooth applications.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothSocket#connect} to initiate the outgoing connection.
     * <p>Application using this API is responsible for obtaining PSM value from remote device.
     * <p>The remote device will be authenticated and communication on this socket will be
     * encrypted.
     * <p> Use this socket if an authenticated socket link is possible. Authentication refers
     * to the authentication of the link key to prevent man-in-the-middle type of attacks.
