     * If the <code>offset</code> is within a word or on a word boundary that can only be
     * considered the start of a word (e.g. _word where "_" is any character that would not
     * be considered part of the word) then this returns the index of the first character of
     * that word.
     *
     * If the offset is on a word boundary that can be considered the start and end of a
     * word, e.g. AABB (where AA and BB are both words) and the offset is the boundary
     * between AA and BB, this would return the start of the previous word, AA.
     *
     * Returns BreakIterator.DONE if there is no previous boundary.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException is offset is not valid.
