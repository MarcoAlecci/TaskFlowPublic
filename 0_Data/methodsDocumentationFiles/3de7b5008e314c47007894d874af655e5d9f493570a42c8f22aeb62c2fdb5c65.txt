         * on the launcher.
         *
         * When selecting a target activity, keep the following in mind:
         * <ul>
         * <li>All dynamic shortcuts must have a target activity.  When a shortcut with no target
         * activity is published using
         * {@link ShortcutManager#addDynamicShortcuts(List)} or
         * {@link ShortcutManager#setDynamicShortcuts(List)},
         * the first main activity defined in the app's <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>
         * file is used.
         *
         * <li>Only "main" activities&mdash;ones that define the {@link Intent#ACTION_MAIN}
         * and {@link Intent#CATEGORY_LAUNCHER} intent filters&mdash;can be target
         * activities.
         *
         * <li>By default, the first main activity defined in the app's manifest is
         * the target activity.
         *
         * <li>A target activity must belong to the publisher app.
         * </ul>
