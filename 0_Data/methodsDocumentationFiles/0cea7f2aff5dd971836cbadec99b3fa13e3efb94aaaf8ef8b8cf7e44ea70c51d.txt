     * Returns a Unicode bidi mark matching the context directionality (LRM or RLM) if either the
     * overall or the exit directionality of a given string is opposite to the context directionality.
     * Putting this after the string (including its directionality declaration wrapping) prevents it
     * from "sticking" to other opposite-directionality text or a number appearing after it inline
     * with only neutral content in between. Otherwise returns the empty string. While the exit
     * directionality is determined by scanning the end of the string, the overall directionality is
     * given explicitly by a heuristic to estimate the {@code str}'s directionality.
     *
     * @param str CharSequence after which the mark may need to appear.
     * @param heuristic The text direction heuristic that will be used to estimate the {@code str}'s
     *                  directionality.
     * @return LRM for RTL text in LTR context; RLM for LTR text in RTL context;
     *     else, the empty string.
