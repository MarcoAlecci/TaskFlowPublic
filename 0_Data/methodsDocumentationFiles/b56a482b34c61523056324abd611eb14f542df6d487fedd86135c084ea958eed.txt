         * Sets the group Id of the {@link PhoneAccount}. When a new {@link PhoneAccount} is
         * registered to Telecom, it will replace another {@link PhoneAccount} that is already
         * registered in Telecom and take on the current user defaults and enabled status. There can
         * only be one {@link PhoneAccount} with a non-empty group number registered to Telecom at a
         * time. By default, there is no group Id for a {@link PhoneAccount} (an empty String). Only
         * grouped {@link PhoneAccount}s with the same {@link ConnectionService} can be replaced.
         * <p>
         * Note: This is an API specific to the Telephony stack; the group Id will be ignored for
         * callers not holding the correct permission.

         * @param groupId The group Id of the {@link PhoneAccount} that will replace any other
