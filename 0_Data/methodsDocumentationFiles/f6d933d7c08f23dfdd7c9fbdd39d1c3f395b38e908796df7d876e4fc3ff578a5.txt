     * Sets whether this Preference has enabled to have its view recycled when used in the list
     * view. By default the recycling is enabled.
     *
     * <p>The value can be changed only before this preference is added to the preference hierarchy.
     *
     * <p>If view recycling is not allowed then each time the list view populates this preference
     * the {@link #getView(View, ViewGroup)} method receives a {@code null} convert view and needs
     * to recreate the view. Otherwise view gets recycled and only {@link #onBindView(View)} gets
     * called.
     *
     * @param enabled set {@code true} if this preference view should be recycled
