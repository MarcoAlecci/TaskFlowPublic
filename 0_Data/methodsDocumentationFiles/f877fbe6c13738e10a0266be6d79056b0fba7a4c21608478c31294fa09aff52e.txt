     * When {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#FLAG_REQUEST_TOUCH_EXPLORATION_MODE} is enabled, this
     * function requests that touch interactions starting in the specified region of the screen
     * bypass the gesture detector. There can only be one gesture detection passthrough region per
     * display. Requesting a new gesture detection passthrough region clears the existing one. To
     * disable this passthrough and return to the original behavior, pass in an empty region. When
     * {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#FLAG_REQUEST_TOUCH_EXPLORATION_MODE} is disabled this
     * function has no effect.
     *
     * @param displayId The display on which to set this region.
     * @param region the region of the screen.
