     * Specifies the preferred network type.  When the device has more
     * than one type available the preferred network type will be used.
     *
     * @param preference the network type to prefer over all others.  It is
     *         unspecified what happens to the old preferred network in the
     *         overall ordering.
     * @deprecated Functionality has been removed as it no longer makes sense,
     *             with many more than two networks - we'd need an array to express
     *             preference.  Instead we use dynamic network properties of
     *             the networks to describe their precedence.
