     * Called by device owners or profile owners of an organization-owned managed profile to to set
     * a local system update policy. When a new policy is set,
     * {@link #ACTION_SYSTEM_UPDATE_POLICY_CHANGED} is broadcasted.
     * <p>
     * If the supplied system update policy has freeze periods set but the freeze periods do not
     * meet 90-day maximum length or 60-day minimum separation requirement set out in
     * {@link SystemUpdatePolicy#setFreezePeriods},
     * {@link SystemUpdatePolicy.ValidationFailedException} will the thrown. Note that the system
     * keeps a record of freeze periods the device experienced previously, and combines them with
     * the new freeze periods to be set when checking the maximum freeze length and minimum freeze
     * separation constraints. As a result, freeze periods that passed validation during
     * {@link SystemUpdatePolicy#setFreezePeriods} might fail the additional checks here due to
     * the freeze period history. If this is causing issues during development,
     * {@code adb shell dpm clear-freeze-period-record} can be used to clear the record.

     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with. All
     *            components in the device owner package can set system update policies and the most
     *            recent policy takes effect.
     * @param policy the new policy, or {@code null} to clear the current policy.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device owner or a profile owner of an
     *      organization-owned managed profile.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the policy type or maintenance window is not valid.
     * @throws SystemUpdatePolicy.ValidationFailedException if the policy's freeze period does not
     *             meet the requirement.
