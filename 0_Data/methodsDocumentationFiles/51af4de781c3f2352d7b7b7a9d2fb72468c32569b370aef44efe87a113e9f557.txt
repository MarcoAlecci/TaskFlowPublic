     * Version of {@link #prepare(Context)} which does not require user consent.
     *
     * <p>Requires {@link android.Manifest.permission#CONTROL_VPN} and should generally not be
     * used. Only acceptable in situations where user consent has been obtained through other means.
     *
     * <p>Once this is run, future preparations may be done with the standard prepare method as this
     * will authorize the package to prepare the VPN without consent in the future.
