     * Applies each of the {@link ContentProviderOperation} objects and returns an array
     * of their results. Passes through OperationApplicationException, which may be thrown
     * by the call to {@link ContentProviderOperation#apply}.
     * If all the applications succeed then a {@link ContentProviderResult} array with the
     * same number of elements as the operations will be returned. It is implementation-specific
     * how many, if any, operations will have been successfully applied if a call to
     * apply results in a {@link OperationApplicationException}.
     * @param authority the authority of the ContentProvider to which this batch should be applied
     * @param operations the operations to apply
     * @return the results of the applications
     * @throws OperationApplicationException thrown if an application fails.
     * See {@link ContentProviderOperation#apply} for more information.
     * @throws RemoteException thrown if a RemoteException is encountered while attempting
     *   to communicate with a remote provider.
