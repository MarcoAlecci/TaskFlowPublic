     * Request that the system start watching for the calling process to exceed a pss
     * size as given here.  Once called, the system will look for any occasions where it
     * sees the associated process with a larger pss size and, when this happens, automatically
     * pull a heap dump from it and allow the user to share the data.  Note that this request
     * continues running even if the process is killed and restarted.  To remove the watch,
     * use {@link #clearWatchHeapLimit()}.
     *
     * <p>This API only works if the calling process has been marked as
     * {@link ApplicationInfo#FLAG_DEBUGGABLE} or this is running on a debuggable
     * (userdebug or eng) build.</p>
     *
     * <p>Callers can optionally implement {@link #ACTION_REPORT_HEAP_LIMIT} to directly
     * handle heap limit reports themselves.</p>
     *
     * @param pssSize The size in bytes to set the limit at.
