     * Does the hard part of measureChildren: figuring out the MeasureSpec to
     * pass to a particular child. This method figures out the right MeasureSpec
     * for one dimension (height or width) of one child view.
     *
     * The goal is to combine information from our MeasureSpec with the
     * LayoutParams of the child to get the best possible results. For example,
     * if the this view knows its size (because its MeasureSpec has a mode of
     * EXACTLY), and the child has indicated in its LayoutParams that it wants
     * to be the same size as the parent, the parent should ask the child to
     * layout given an exact size.
     *
     * @param spec The requirements for this view
     * @param padding The padding of this view for the current dimension and
     *        margins, if applicable
     * @param childDimension How big the child wants to be in the current
     *        dimension
     * @return a MeasureSpec integer for the child
