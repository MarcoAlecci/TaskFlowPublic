     * This method is called by LayoutTransition when there are 'changing' animations that need
     * to start after the layout/setup phase. The request is forwarded to the ViewAncestor, who
     * starts all pending transitions prior to the drawing phase in the current traversal.
     *
     * @param transition The LayoutTransition to be started on the next traversal.
