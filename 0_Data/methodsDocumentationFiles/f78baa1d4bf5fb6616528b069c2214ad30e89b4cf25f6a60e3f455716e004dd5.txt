     * Publish a single dynamic shortcut. If there are already dynamic or pinned shortcuts with the
     * same ID, each mutable shortcut is updated.
     *
     * <p>This method is useful when posting notifications which are tagged with shortcut IDs; In
     * order to make sure shortcuts exist and are up-to-date, without the need to explicitly handle
     * the shortcut count limit.
     * @see android.app.NotificationManager#notify(int, Notification)
     * @see Notification.Builder#setShortcutId(String)
     *
     * <p>If {@link #getMaxShortcutCountPerActivity()} is already reached, an existing shortcut with
     * the lowest rank will be removed to add space for the new shortcut.
     *
     * <p>If the rank of the shortcut is not explicitly set, it will be set to zero, and shortcut
     * will be added to the top of the list.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if trying to update an immutable shortcut.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException when the user is locked.
