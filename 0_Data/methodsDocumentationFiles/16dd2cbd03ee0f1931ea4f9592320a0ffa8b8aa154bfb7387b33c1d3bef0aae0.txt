     * Returns a CharSequence concatenating the specified CharSequences,
     * retaining their spans if any.
     *
     * If there are no parameters, an empty string will be returned.
     *
     * If the number of parameters is exactly one, that parameter is returned as output, even if it
     * is null.
     *
     * If the number of parameters is at least two, any null CharSequence among the parameters is
     * treated as if it was the string <code>"null"</code>.
     *
     * If there are paragraph spans in the source CharSequences that satisfy paragraph boundary
     * requirements in the sources but would no longer satisfy them in the concatenated
     * CharSequence, they may get extended in the resulting CharSequence or not retained.
