     * Adds an account directly to the AccountManager. Normally used by sign-up
     * wizards associated with authenticators, not directly by applications.
     * <p>Calling this method does not update the last authenticated timestamp,
     * referred by {@link #KEY_LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME}. To update it, call
     * {@link #notifyAccountAuthenticated(Account)} after getting success.
     * However, if this method is called when it is triggered by addAccount() or
     * addAccountAsUser() or similar functions, then there is no need to update
     * timestamp manually as it is updated automatically by framework on
     * successful completion of the mentioned functions.
     * <p>It is safe to call this method from the main thread.
     * <p>This method requires the caller to have a signature match with the
     * authenticator that owns the specified account.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If targeting your app to work on API level 22 and before,
     * AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS permission is needed for those platforms. See docs
     * for this function in API level 22.
