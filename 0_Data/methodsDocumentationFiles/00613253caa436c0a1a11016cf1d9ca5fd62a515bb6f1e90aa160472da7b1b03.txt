     * Acquire a lease to the blob represented by {@code blobHandle}. This lease indicates to the
     * system that the caller wants the blob to be kept around.
     *
     * <p> This is similar to {@link #acquireLease(BlobHandle, int, long)} except clients don't
     * have to specify the lease expiry time upfront using this API and need to explicitly
     * release the lease using {@link #releaseLease(BlobHandle)} when they no longer like to keep
     * a blob around.
     *
     * <p> Any active leases will be automatically released when the blob's expiry time
     * ({@link BlobHandle#getExpiryTimeMillis()}) is elapsed.
     *
     * <p> This lease information is persisted and calling this more than once will result in
     * latest lease overriding any previous lease.
     *
     * <p> When an app acquires a lease on a blob, the System will try to keep this
     * blob around but note that it can still be deleted if it was requested by the user.
     *
     * <p> In case the resource name for the {@code descriptionResId} is modified as part of
     * an app update, apps should re-acquire the lease with the new resource id.
     *
     * @param blobHandle the {@link BlobHandle} representing the blob that the caller wants to
     *                   acquire a lease for.
     * @param descriptionResId the resource id for a short description string that can be surfaced
     *                         to the user explaining what the blob is used for.
     *
     * @throws IOException when there is an I/O error while acquiring a lease to the blob.
     * @throws SecurityException when the blob represented by the {@code blobHandle} does not
     *                           exist or the caller does not have access to it.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException when {@code blobHandle} is invalid.
     * @throws LimitExceededException when a lease could not be acquired, such as when the
     *                                caller is trying to acquire too many leases or acquire
     *                                leases on too much data. Apps can avoid this by checking
     *                                the remaining quota using
     *                                {@link #getRemainingLeaseQuotaBytes()} before trying to
     *                                acquire a lease.
