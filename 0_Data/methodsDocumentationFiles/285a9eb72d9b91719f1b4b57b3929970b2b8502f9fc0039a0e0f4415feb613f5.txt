     * Request endlessly repeating capture of images by this capture session.
     *
     * <p>The behavior of this method matches that of
     * {@link #setRepeatingRequest(CaptureRequest, CaptureCallback, Handler)},
     * except that it uses {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} as an argument
     * instead of {@link android.os.Handler}.</p>
     *
     * @param request the request to repeat indefinitely
     * @param executor the executor which will be used for invoking the listener.
     * @param listener The callback object to notify every time the
     * request finishes processing.
     *
     * @return int A unique capture sequence ID used by
     *             {@link CaptureCallback#onCaptureSequenceCompleted}.

     * @throws CameraAccessException if the camera device is no longer connected or has
     *                               encountered a fatal error
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this session is no longer active, either because the session
     *                               was explicitly closed, a new session has been created
     *                               or the camera device has been closed.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the request references no Surfaces or references Surfaces
     *                                  that are not currently configured as outputs; or the request
     *                                  is a reprocess capture request; or the capture targets a
     *                                  Surface in the middle of being {@link #prepare prepared}; or
     *                                  the executor is null; or the listener is null.
