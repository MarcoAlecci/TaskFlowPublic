     * Executes a shell command. This method returns two file descriptors,
     * one that points to the standard output stream (element at index 0), and one that points
     * to the standard input stream (element at index 1). The command execution is similar
     * to running "adb shell <command>" from a host connected to the device.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> It is your responsibility to close the returned file
     * descriptors once you are done reading/writing.
