     * Apply additional gravity behavior based on the overall "display" that an
     * object exists in.  This can be used after
     * {@link #apply(int, int, int, Rect, int, int, Rect)} to place the object
     * within a visible display.  By default this moves or clips the object
     * to be visible in the display; the gravity flags
     * {@link #DISPLAY_CLIP_HORIZONTAL} and {@link #DISPLAY_CLIP_VERTICAL}
     * can be used to change this behavior.
     *
     * @param gravity Gravity constants to modify the placement within the
     * display.
     * @param display The rectangle of the display in which the object is
     * being placed.
     * @param inoutObj Supplies the current object position; returns with it
     * modified if needed to fit in the display.
     * @param layoutDirection The layout direction.
