     * Introspection API to retrieve audio product strategies.
     * When implementing {Car|Oem}AudioManager, use this method  to retrieve the collection of
     * audio product strategies, which is indexed by a weakly typed index in order to be extended
     * by OEM without any needs of AOSP patches.
     * The {Car|Oem}AudioManager can expose API to build {@link AudioAttributes} for a given product
     * strategy refered either by its index or human readable string. It will allow clients
     * application to start streaming data using these {@link AudioAttributes} on the selected
     * device by Audio Policy Engine.
     * @return a (possibly zero-length) array of
     *         {@see android.media.audiopolicy.AudioProductStrategy} objects.
