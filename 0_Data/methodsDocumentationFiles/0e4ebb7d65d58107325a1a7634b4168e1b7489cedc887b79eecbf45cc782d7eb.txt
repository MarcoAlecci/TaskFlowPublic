     * Returns the tappable element insets.
     *
     * <p>The tappable element insets represent how much tappable elements <b>must at least</b> be
     * inset to remain both tappable and visually unobstructed by persistent system windows.
     *
     * <p>This may be smaller than {@link #getSystemWindowInsets()} if the system window is
     * largely transparent and lets through simple taps (but not necessarily more complex gestures).
     *
     * <p>Note that generally, tappable elements <strong>should</strong> be aligned with the
     * {@link #getSystemWindowInsets() system window insets} instead to avoid overlapping with the
     * system bars.
     *
     * <p>When {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE} is requested, an inset will be returned
     * even when the area covered by the inset would be tappable due to
     * {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN} or
     * {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION}.
     *
     * <p>This inset is consumed together with the {@link #getSystemWindowInsets()
     * system window insets} by {@link #consumeSystemWindowInsets()}.
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #getInsets(int)} with {@link Type#tappableElement()} instead.
