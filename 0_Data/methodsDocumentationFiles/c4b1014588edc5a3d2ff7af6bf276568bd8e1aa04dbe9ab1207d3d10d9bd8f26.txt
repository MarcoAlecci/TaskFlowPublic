     * Copy the current screen contents into a hardware bitmap and return it.
     * Note: If you want to modify the Bitmap in software, you will need to copy the Bitmap into
     * a software Bitmap using {@link Bitmap#copy(Bitmap.Config, boolean)}
     *
     * CAVEAT: Versions of screenshot that return a {@link Bitmap} can be extremely slow; avoid use
     * unless absolutely necessary; prefer the versions that use a {@link Surface} such as
     * {@link SurfaceControl#screenshot(IBinder, Surface)} or {@link GraphicBuffer} such as
     * {@link SurfaceControl#screenshotToBuffer(IBinder, Rect, int, int, boolean, int)}.
