     * Shows the magnifier on the screen at a position that is independent from its content
     * position. The first two arguments represent the coordinates of the center of the
     * content source going to be magnified and copied to the magnifier. The last two arguments
     * represent the coordinates of the center of the magnifier itself. All four coordinates
     * are relative to the top left corner of the magnified view. If you consider using this
     * method such that the offset between the source center and the magnifier center coordinates
     * remains constant, you should consider using method {@link #show(float, float)} instead.

     * @param magnifierCenterX horizontal coordinate of the magnifier center, relative to the view
     * @param magnifierCenterY vertical coordinate of the magnifier center, relative to the view
