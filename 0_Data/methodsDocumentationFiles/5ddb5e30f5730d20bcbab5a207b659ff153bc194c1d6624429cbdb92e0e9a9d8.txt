     * Broadcast the given intent to all interested BroadcastReceivers, allowing
     * an optional required permission to be enforced.  This
     * call is asynchronous; it returns immediately, and you will continue
     * executing while the receivers are run.  No results are propagated from
     * receivers and receivers can not abort the broadcast. If you want
     * to allow receivers to propagate results or abort the broadcast, you must
     * send an ordered broadcast using
     * {@link #sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)}.
     *
     * <p>See {@link BroadcastReceiver} for more information on Intent broadcasts.
     *
     * @param intent The Intent to broadcast; all receivers matching this
     *               Intent will receive the broadcast.
     * @param receiverPermission (optional) String naming a permission that
     *               a receiver must hold in order to receive your broadcast.
     *               If null, no permission is required.
