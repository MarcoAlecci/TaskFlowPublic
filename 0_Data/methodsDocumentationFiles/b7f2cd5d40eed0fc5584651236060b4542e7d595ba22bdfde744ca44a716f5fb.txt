     * Recycled view pools allow multiple RecyclerViews to share a common pool of scrap views.
     * This can be useful if you have multiple RecyclerViews with adapters that use the same
     * view types, for example if you have several data sets with the same kinds of item views
     * displayed by a {@link android.support.v4.view.ViewPager ViewPager}.
     *
     * @param pool Pool to set. If this parameter is null a new pool will be created and used.
