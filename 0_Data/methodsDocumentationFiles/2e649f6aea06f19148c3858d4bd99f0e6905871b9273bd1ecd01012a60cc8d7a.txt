     * Gets the node bounds in screen coordinates.
     * <p>
     * When magnification is enabled, the bounds in screen are scaled up by magnification scale
     * and the positions are also adjusted according to the offset of magnification viewport.
     * For example, it returns Rect(-180, -180, 0, 0) for original bounds Rect(10, 10, 100, 100),
     * when the magnification scale is 2 and offsets for X and Y are both 200.

     * @param outBounds The output node bounds.
