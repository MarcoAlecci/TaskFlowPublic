     * We want to hold a wake lock while we do the prepare and play.  The stop probably is
     * optional, but it won't hurt to have it too.  The problem is that if you start a sound
     * while you're holding a wake lock (e.g. an alarm starting a notification), you want the
     * sound to play, but if the CPU turns off before mThread gets to work, it won't.  The
     * simplest way to deal with this is to make it so there is a wake lock held while the
     * thread is starting or running.  You're going to need the WAKE_LOCK permission if you're
     * going to call this.
     *
     * This must be called before the first time play is called.
