         * RecyclerView to come on screen, due to the movement of another, containing RecyclerView.
         *
         * <p>This method is only called when a RecyclerView is nested in another RecyclerView.</p>
         *
         * <p>If item prefetch is enabled for this LayoutManager, as well in another containing
         * LayoutManager, this method is called in between draw traversals to gather
         * which positions this LayoutManager will first need, once it appears on the screen.</p>
         *
         * <p>For example, if this LayoutManager represents a horizontally scrolling list within a
         * vertically scrolling LayoutManager, this method would be called when the horizontal list
         * is about to come onscreen.</p>
         *
         * <p>The LayoutManager should call {@link LayoutPrefetchRegistry#addPosition(int, int)} for
         * each item to be prepared, and these positions will have their ViewHolders created and
         * bound, if there is sufficient time available, in advance of being needed by a
         * scroll or layout.</p>
