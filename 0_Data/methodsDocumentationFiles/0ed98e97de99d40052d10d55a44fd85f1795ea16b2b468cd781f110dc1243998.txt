     * Name of State for debugging purposes.
     *
     * This default implementation returns the class name, returning
     * the instance name would better in cases where a State class
     * is used for multiple states. But normally there is one class per
     * state and the class name is sufficient and easy to get. You may
     * want to provide a setName or some other mechanism for setting
     * another name if the class name is not appropriate.
