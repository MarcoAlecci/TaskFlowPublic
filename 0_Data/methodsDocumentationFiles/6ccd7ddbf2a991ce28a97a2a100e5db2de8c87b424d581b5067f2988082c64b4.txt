     * Get the estimated speed accuracy of this location, in meters per second.
     *
     * <p>We define speed accuracy at 68% confidence.  Specifically, as 1-side of the
     * 2-sided range above and below the estimated speed reported by {@link #getSpeed()},
     * within which there is a 68% probability of finding the true speed.
     *
     * <p>In the case where the underlying
     * distribution is assumed Gaussian normal, this would be considered 1 standard deviation.
     *
     * <p>For example, if {@link #getSpeed()} returns 5, and
     * {@link #getSpeedAccuracyMetersPerSecond()} returns 1, then there is a 68% probability of
     * the true speed being between 4 and 6 meters per second.
     *
     * <p>Note that the speed and speed accuracy is often better than would be obtained simply from
     * differencing sequential positions, such as when the Doppler measurements from GNSS satellites
     * are used.
     *
     * <p>If this location does not have a speed accuracy, then 0.0 is returned.
