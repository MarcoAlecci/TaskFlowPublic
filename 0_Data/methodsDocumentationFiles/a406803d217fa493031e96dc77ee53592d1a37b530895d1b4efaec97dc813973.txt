     * Display the content view in a popup window anchored to the bottom-left
     * corner of the anchor view offset by the specified x and y coordinates.
     * If there is not enough room on screen to show the popup in its entirety,
     * this method tries to find a parent scroll view to scroll. If no parent
     * scroll view can be scrolled, the bottom-left corner of the popup is
     * pinned at the top left corner of the anchor view.
     * <p>
     * If the view later scrolls to move <code>anchor</code> to a different
     * location, the popup will be moved correspondingly.
     *
     * @param anchor the view on which to pin the popup window
     * @param xoff A horizontal offset from the anchor in pixels
     * @param yoff A vertical offset from the anchor in pixels
