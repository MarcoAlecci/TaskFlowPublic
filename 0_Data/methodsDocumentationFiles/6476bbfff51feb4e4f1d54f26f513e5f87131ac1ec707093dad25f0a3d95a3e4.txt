     * This method should be triggered by the IMS providers when the status report of the sent
     * message is received. The platform will handle the report and notify the IMS provider of the
     * result by calling {@link #acknowledgeSmsReport(int, int, int)}.
     *
     * This method must not be called before {@link #onReady()} is called or the call will fail. If
     * the platform is not available, {@link #acknowledgeSmsReport(int, int, int)} will be called
     * with the {@link #STATUS_REPORT_STATUS_ERROR} result code.
     * @param token unique token generated by IMS providers that the platform will use to trigger
     *              callbacks for this message.
     * @param format the format of the message.
     * @param pdu PDU representing the content of the status report.
     * @throws RuntimeException if called before {@link #onReady()} is triggered
