     * Initiate a connection to a Bluetooth GATT capable device.
     *
     * <p>The connection may not be established right away, but will be
     * completed when the remote device is available. A
     * {@link BluetoothGattServerCallback#onConnectionStateChange} callback will be
     * invoked when the connection state changes as a result of this function.
     *
     * <p>The autoConnect parameter determines whether to actively connect to
     * the remote device, or rather passively scan and finalize the connection
     * when the remote device is in range/available. Generally, the first ever
     * connection to a device should be direct (autoConnect set to false) and
     * subsequent connections to known devices should be invoked with the
     * autoConnect parameter set to true.
     *
     * <p>Requires {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH} permission.
     *
     * @param autoConnect Whether to directly connect to the remote device (false) or to
     * automatically connect as soon as the remote device becomes available (true).
     * @return true, if the connection attempt was initiated successfully
