     * <p>When set to true, this is a signal to ancestor views in the hierarchy that
     * this view would prefer to be brought fully into view when it gains focus.
     * For example, a text field that a user is meant to type into. Other views such
     * as scrolling containers may prefer to opt-out of this behavior.</p>

     * based on their preferred behavior.</p>
