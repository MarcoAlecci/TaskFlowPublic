     * Called by a device or profile owner, or delegated certificate installer, to associate
     * certificates with a key pair that was generated using {@link #generateKeyPair}, and
     * set whether the key is available for the user to choose in the certificate selection
     * prompt.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or
     *            {@code null} if calling from a delegated certificate installer.
     * @param alias The private key alias under which to install the certificate. The {@code alias}
     *        should denote an existing private key. If a certificate with that alias already
     *        exists, it will be overwritten.
     * @param certs The certificate chain to install. The chain should start with the leaf
     *        certificate and include the chain of trust in order. This will be returned by
     *        {@link android.security.KeyChain#getCertificateChain}.
     * @param isUserSelectable {@code true} to indicate that a user can select this key via the
     *        certificate selection prompt, {@code false} to indicate that this key can only be
     *        granted access by implementing
     *        {@link android.app.admin.DeviceAdminReceiver#onChoosePrivateKeyAlias}.
     * @return {@code true} if the provided {@code alias} exists and the certificates has been
     *        successfully associated with it, {@code false} otherwise.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not {@code null} and not a device or profile
     *         owner, or {@code admin} is null but the calling application is not a delegated
     *         certificate installer.
