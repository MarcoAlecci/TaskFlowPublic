     * Returns the default SSL server socket factory.
     *
     * <p>The first time this method is called, the security property
     * "ssl.ServerSocketFactory.provider" is examined. If it is non-null, a
     * class by that name is loaded and instantiated. If that is successful and
     * the object is an instance of SSLServerSocketFactory, it is made the
     * default SSL server socket factory.
     *
     * <p>Otherwise, this method returns
     * <code>SSLContext.getDefault().getServerSocketFactory()</code>. If that
     * call fails, an inoperative factory is returned.
     *
     * @return the default <code>ServerSocketFactory</code>
     * @see SSLContext#getDefault
