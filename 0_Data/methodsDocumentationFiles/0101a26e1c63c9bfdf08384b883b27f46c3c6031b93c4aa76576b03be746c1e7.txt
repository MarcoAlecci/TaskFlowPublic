     * Start the remote device discovery process.
     * <p>The discovery process usually involves an inquiry scan of about 12
     * seconds, followed by a page scan of each new device to retrieve its
     * Bluetooth name.
     * <p>This is an asynchronous call, it will return immediately. Register
     * for {@link #ACTION_DISCOVERY_STARTED} and {@link
     * #ACTION_DISCOVERY_FINISHED} intents to determine exactly when the
     * discovery starts and completes. Register for {@link
     * BluetoothDevice#ACTION_FOUND} to be notified as remote Bluetooth devices
     * are found.
     * <p>Device discovery is a heavyweight procedure. New connections to
     * remote Bluetooth devices should not be attempted while discovery is in
     * progress, and existing connections will experience limited bandwidth
     * and high latency. Use {@link #cancelDiscovery()} to cancel an ongoing
     * discovery. Discovery is not managed by the Activity,
     * but is run as a system service, so an application should always call
     * {@link BluetoothAdapter#cancelDiscovery()} even if it
     * did not directly request a discovery, just to be sure.
     * <p>Device discovery will only find remote devices that are currently
     * <i>discoverable</i> (inquiry scan enabled). Many Bluetooth devices are
     * not discoverable by default, and need to be entered into a special mode.
     * <p>If Bluetooth state is not {@link #STATE_ON}, this API
     * will return false. After turning on Bluetooth,
     * wait for {@link #ACTION_STATE_CHANGED} with {@link #STATE_ON}
     * to get the updated value.
     *
     * @return true on success, false on error
