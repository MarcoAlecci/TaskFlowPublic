     * Indicates whether network connectivity exists and it is possible to establish
     * connections and pass data.
     * <p>Always call this before attempting to perform data transactions.
     * @return {@code true} if network connectivity exists, {@code false} otherwise.
     * @deprecated Apps should instead use the
     *             {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback} API to
     *             learn about connectivity changes. See
     *             {@link ConnectivityManager#registerDefaultNetworkCallback} and
     *             {@link ConnectivityManager#registerNetworkCallback}. These will
     *             give a more accurate picture of the connectivity state of
     *             the device and let apps react more easily and quickly to changes.
