     * Sets the absolute minimum scrolling velocity.
     * <p>
     * If both relative and minimum velocities are specified, the minimum
     * velocity will be used to clamp the calculated relative velocity.
     *
     * @param horizontalMin The minimum horizontal scrolling velocity, or
     *            {@link #NO_MIN} to leave the relative value unconstrained.
     * @param verticalMin The minimum vertical scrolling velocity, or
     *            {@link #NO_MIN} to leave the relative value unconstrained.
     * @return The scroll helper, which may used to chain setter calls.
