     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} instance with the specified scale. If
     * the new scale is greater than the old scale, then additional zeros are
     * added to the unscaled value. If the new scale is smaller than the old
     * scale, then trailing zeros are removed. If the trailing digits are not
     * zeros then an ArithmeticException is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If no exception is thrown, then the following equation holds: {@code
     * x.setScale(s).compareTo(x) == 0}.
     *
     * @param newScale
     *            scale of the result returned.
     * @return a new {@code BigDecimal} instance with the specified scale.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if rounding would be necessary.
