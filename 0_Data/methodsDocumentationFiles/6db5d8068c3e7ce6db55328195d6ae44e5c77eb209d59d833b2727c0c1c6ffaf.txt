     * <p>Allows the popup window to split touches across other windows that also
     * support split touch.  When this flag is false, the first pointer
     * that goes down determines the window to which all subsequent touches
     * go until all pointers go up.  When this flag is true, each pointer
     * (not necessarily the first) that goes down determines the window
     * to which all subsequent touches of that pointer will go until that
     * pointer goes up thereby enabling touches with multiple pointers
     * to be split across multiple windows.</p>
     *
     * @param enabled true if the split touches should be enabled, false otherwise
     * @see #isSplitTouchEnabled()
