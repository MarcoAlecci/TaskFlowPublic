     * <p>This method should be treated similarly to setMeasuredDimension and not as a general
     * property. Views that compute their own optical insets should call it as part of measurement.
     * This method does not request layout. If you are setting optical insets outside of
     * measure/layout itself you will want to call requestLayout() yourself.
