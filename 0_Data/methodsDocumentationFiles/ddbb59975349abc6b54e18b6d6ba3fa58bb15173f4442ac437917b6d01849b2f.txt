         * Gets the error tolerance for input device measurements with respect to this axis.
         * <p>
         * For example, a value of 2 indicates that the measured value may be up to +/- 2 units
         * away from the actual value due to noise and device sensitivity limitations.
         * </p>
         * @return The error tolerance.
