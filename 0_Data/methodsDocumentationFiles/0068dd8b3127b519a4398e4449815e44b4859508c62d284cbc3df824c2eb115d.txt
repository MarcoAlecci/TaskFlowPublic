     * Measure the text, stopping early if the measured width exceeds maxWidth.
     * Return the number of chars that were measured, and if measuredWidth is
     * not null, return in it the actual width measured.
     *
     * @param text  The text to measure. Cannot be null.
     * @param measureForwards If true, measure forwards, starting with the
     *                        first character in the string. Otherwise,
     *                        measure backwards, starting with the
     *                        last character in the string.
     * @param maxWidth The maximum width to accumulate.
     * @param measuredWidth Optional. If not null, returns the actual width
     *                     measured.
     * @return The number of chars that were measured. Will always be <=
     *         abs(count).
