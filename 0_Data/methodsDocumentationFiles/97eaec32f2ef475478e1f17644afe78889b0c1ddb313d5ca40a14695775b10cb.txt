     * Default implementation of {@link KeyEvent.Callback#onKeyLongPress(int, KeyEvent)
     * KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyLongPress()}: always returns false (doesn't handle
     * the event).
     * <p>Key presses in software keyboards will generally NOT trigger this listener,
     * although some may elect to do so in some situations. Do not rely on this to
     * catch software key presses.
