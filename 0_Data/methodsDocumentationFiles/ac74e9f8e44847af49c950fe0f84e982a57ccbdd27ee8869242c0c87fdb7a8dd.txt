     * Factory method to start the query based on a number with specific subscription.
     *
     * Note: if the number contains an "@" character we treat it
     * as a SIP address, and look it up directly in the Data table
     * rather than using the PhoneLookup table.
     * TODO: But eventually we should expose two separate methods, one for
     * numbers and one for SIP addresses, and then have
     * PhoneUtils.startGetCallerInfo() decide which one to call based on
     * the phone type of the incoming connection.
