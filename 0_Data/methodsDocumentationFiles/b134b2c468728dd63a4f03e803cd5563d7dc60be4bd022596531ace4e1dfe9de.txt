         * <p>This method is called if a single buffer for a capture could not be sent to its
         * destination surface.</p>
         *
         * <p>If the whole capture failed, then {@link #onCaptureFailed} will be called instead. If
         * some but not all buffers were captured but the result metadata will not be available,
         * then onCaptureFailed will be invoked with {@link CaptureFailure#wasImageCaptured}
         * returning true, along with one or more calls to {@link #onCaptureBufferLost} for the
         * failed outputs.</p>
         *
