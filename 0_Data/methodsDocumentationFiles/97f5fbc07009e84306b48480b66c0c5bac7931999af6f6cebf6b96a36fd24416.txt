     * Show the UI for this session.  This asks the system to go through the process of showing
     * your UI, which will eventually culminate in {@link #onShow}.  This is similar to calling
     * {@link VoiceInteractionService#showSession VoiceInteractionService.showSession}.
     * @param args Arbitrary arguments that will be propagated {@link #onShow}.
     * @param flags Indicates additional optional behavior that should be performed.  May
     * be any combination of
     * {@link VoiceInteractionSession#SHOW_WITH_ASSIST VoiceInteractionSession.SHOW_WITH_ASSIST} and
     * {@link VoiceInteractionSession#SHOW_WITH_SCREENSHOT
     * VoiceInteractionSession.SHOW_WITH_SCREENSHOT}
     * to request that the system generate and deliver assist data on the current foreground
     * app as part of showing the session UI.
