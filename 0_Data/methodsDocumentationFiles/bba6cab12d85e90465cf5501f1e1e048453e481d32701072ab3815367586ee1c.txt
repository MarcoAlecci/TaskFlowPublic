     * Control whether this activity's main window is visible.  This is intended
     * only for the special case of an activity that is not going to show a
     * UI itself, but can't just finish prior to onResume() because it needs
     * to wait for a service binding or such.  Setting this to false allows
     * you to prevent your UI from being shown during that time.
     *
     * <p>The default value for this is taken from the
     * {@link android.R.attr#windowNoDisplay} attribute of the activity's theme.
