     * APK Signature Scheme v3 enables packages to provide a proof-of-rotation record that the
     * platform verifies, and uses, to allow the use of new signing certificates.  This is only
     * available to packages that are not signed by multiple signers.  In the event of a change to a
     * new signing certificate, the package's past signing certificates are presented as well.  Any
     * check of a package's signing certificate should also include a search through its entire
     * signing history, since it could change to a new signing certificate at any time.
