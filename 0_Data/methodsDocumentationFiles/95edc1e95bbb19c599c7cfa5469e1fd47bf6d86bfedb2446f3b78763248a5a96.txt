     * Return an XmlResourceParser through which you can read a generic XML
     * resource for the given resource ID.
     * 
     * <p>The XmlPullParser implementation returned here has some limited
     * functionality.  In particular, you can't change its input, and only
     * high-level parsing events are available (since the document was
     * pre-parsed for you at build time, which involved merging text and
     * stripping comments).
     * 
     * @param id The desired resource identifier, as generated by the aapt
     *           tool. This integer encodes the package, type, and resource
     *           entry. The value 0 is an invalid identifier.
     *
     * @throws NotFoundException Throws NotFoundException if the given ID does not exist.
     * 
     * @return A new parser object through which you can read
     *         the XML data.
     *
