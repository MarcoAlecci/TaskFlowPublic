     * <p>If this property is set to true the view will be permitted to initiate nested
     * scrolling operations with a compatible parent view in the current hierarchy. If this
     * view does not implement nested scrolling this will have no effect. Disabling nested scrolling
     * while a nested scroll is in progress has the effect of {@link #stopNestedScroll() stopping}
     * the nested scroll.</p>
