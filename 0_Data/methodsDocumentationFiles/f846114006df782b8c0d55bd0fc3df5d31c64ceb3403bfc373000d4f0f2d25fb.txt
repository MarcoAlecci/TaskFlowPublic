     * Append the specified arc to the path as a new contour. If the start of
     * the path is different from the path's current last point, then an
     * automatic lineTo() is added to connect the current contour to the
     * start of the arc. However, if the path is empty, then we call moveTo()
     * with the first point of the arc.
     *
     * @param startAngle  Starting angle (in degrees) where the arc begins
     * @param sweepAngle  Sweep angle (in degrees) measured clockwise, treated
     *                    mod 360.
     * @param forceMoveTo If true, always begin a new contour with the arc
