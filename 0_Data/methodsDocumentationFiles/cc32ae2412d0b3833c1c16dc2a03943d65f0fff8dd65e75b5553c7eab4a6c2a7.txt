     * Replaces the current {@code VolumeShaper}
     * {@code configuration} with a new {@code configuration}.
     *
     * This allows the user to change the volume shape
     * while the existing {@code VolumeShaper} is in effect.
     *
     * The effect of {@code replace()} is similar to an atomic close of
     * the existing {@code VolumeShaper} and creation of a new {@code VolumeShaper}.
     *
     * If the {@code operation} is {@link VolumeShaper.Operation#PLAY} then the
     * new curve starts immediately.
     *
     * If the {@code operation} is
     * {@link VolumeShaper.Operation#REVERSE}, then the new curve will
     * be delayed until {@code PLAY} is applied.
     *
     * @param configuration the new {@code configuration} to use.
     * @param operation the {@code operation} to apply to the {@code VolumeShaper}
     * @param join if true, match the start volume of the
     *             new {@code configuration} to the current volume of the existing
     *             {@code VolumeShaper}, to avoid discontinuity.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the player is uninitialized or if there
     *         is a critical failure. In that case, the {@code VolumeShaper} should be
     *         recreated.
