     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} instance where the decimal point has
     * been moved {@code n} places to the left. If {@code n < 0} then the
     * decimal point is moved {@code -n} places to the right.
     *
     * <p>The result is obtained by changing its scale. If the scale of the result
     * becomes negative, then its precision is increased such that the scale is
     * zero.
     *
     * <p>Note, that {@code movePointLeft(0)} returns a result which is
     * mathematically equivalent, but which has {@code scale >= 0}.
