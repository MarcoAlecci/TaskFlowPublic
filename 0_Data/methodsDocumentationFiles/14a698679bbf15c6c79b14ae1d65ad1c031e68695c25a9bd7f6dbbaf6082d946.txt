    * Returns a pre-defined program store object with the following
    * characteristics:
    *  - incoming pixels are drawn if their depth value is less than
    *    the stored value in the depth buffer. If the pixel is
    *    drawn, its value is also stored in the depth buffer
    *  - if the incoming (Source) pixel passes depth test, its value
    *    is combined with the stored color (Dest) using the
    *    following formula
    *  Final.RGB = Source.RGB * Source.A + Dest.RGB * (1 - Source.A)
    *
    *  @param rs Context to which the program will belong.
