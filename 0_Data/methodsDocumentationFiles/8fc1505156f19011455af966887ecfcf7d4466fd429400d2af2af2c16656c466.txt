     * Gets the Pseudorange rate at the timestamp in m/s.
     *
     * <p>The error estimate for this value is
     * {@link #getPseudorangeRateUncertaintyMetersPerSecond()}.
     *
     * <p>The value is uncorrected, i.e. corrections for receiver and satellite clock frequency
     * errors are not included.
     *
     * <p>A positive 'uncorrected' value indicates that the SV is moving away from the receiver. The
     * sign of the 'uncorrected' 'pseudorange rate' and its relation to the sign of 'doppler shift'
     * is given by the equation:
     *
     * <pre>
     *      pseudorange rate = -k * doppler shift   (where k is a constant)</pre>
