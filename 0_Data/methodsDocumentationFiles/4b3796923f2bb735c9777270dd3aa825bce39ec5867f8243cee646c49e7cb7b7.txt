     * Reinitialize the logging properties and reread the logging configuration.
     * <p>
     * The same rules are used for locating the configuration properties
     * as are used at startup.  So normally the logging properties will
     * be re-read from the same file that was used at startup.
     * <P>
     * Any log level definitions in the new configuration file will be
     * applied using Logger.setLevel(), if the target Logger exists.
     * <p>
     * A PropertyChangeEvent will be fired after the properties are read.
     *
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
     *             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
     * @exception  IOException if there are IO problems reading the configuration.
