     * Notify the host application that {@link android.webkit.WebView} content left over from
     * previous page navigations will no longer be drawn.
     *
     * <p>This callback can be used to determine the point at which it is safe to make a recycled
     * {@link android.webkit.WebView} visible, ensuring that no stale content is shown. It is called
     * at the earliest point at which it can be guaranteed that {@link WebView#onDraw} will no
     * longer draw any content from previous navigations. The next draw will display either the
     * {@link WebView#setBackgroundColor background color} of the {@link WebView}, or some of the
     * contents of the newly loaded page.
     *
     * <p>This method is called when the body of the HTTP response has started loading, is reflected
     * in the DOM, and will be visible in subsequent draws. This callback occurs early in the
     * document loading process, and as such you should expect that linked resources (for example,
     * CSS and images) may not be available.
     *
     * <p>For more fine-grained notification of visual state updates, see {@link
     * WebView#postVisualStateCallback}.
     *
     * <p>Please note that all the conditions and recommendations applicable to
     * {@link WebView#postVisualStateCallback} also apply to this API.
     *
     * <p>This callback is only called for main frame navigations.
     *
     * @param view The {@link android.webkit.WebView} for which the navigation occurred.
     * @param url  The URL corresponding to the page navigation that triggered this callback.
