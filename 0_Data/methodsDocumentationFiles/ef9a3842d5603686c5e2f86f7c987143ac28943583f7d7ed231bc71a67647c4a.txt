     * key state combination.

     * Returns the Unicode character that the specified key would produce
     * when the specified meta bits (see {@link MetaKeyKeyListener})
     * were active.
     * </p><p>
     * Returns 0 if the key is not one that is used to type Unicode
     * characters.
     * </p><p>
     * If the return value has bit {@link KeyCharacterMap#COMBINING_ACCENT} set, the
     * key is a "dead key" that should be combined with another to
     * actually produce a character -- see {@link KeyCharacterMap#getDeadChar} --
     * after masking with {@link KeyCharacterMap#COMBINING_ACCENT_MASK}.

     * @param metaState The meta key modifier state.
     * @return The associated character or combining accent, or 0 if none.
