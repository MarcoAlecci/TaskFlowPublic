     * Deactivate this {@code IpSecTransform} and free allocated resources.
     *
     * <p>Deactivating a transform while it is still applied to a socket will result in errors on
     * that socket. Make sure to remove transforms by calling {@link
     * IpSecManager#removeTransportModeTransforms}. Note, removing an {@code IpSecTransform} from a
     * socket will not deactivate it (because one transform may be applied to multiple sockets).
     *
     * <p>It is safe to call this method on a transform that has already been deactivated.
