     * Create a {@code Conference} given an outgoing request. This is used to initiate new
     * outgoing conference call.
     *
     * @param connectionManagerPhoneAccount The connection manager account to use for managing
     *         this call.
     *         <p>
     *         If this parameter is not {@code null}, it means that this {@code ConnectionService}
     *         has registered one or more {@code PhoneAccount}s having
     *         {@link PhoneAccount#CAPABILITY_CONNECTION_MANAGER}. This parameter will contain
     *         one of these {@code PhoneAccount}s, while the {@code request} will contain another
     *         (usually but not always distinct) {@code PhoneAccount} to be used for actually
     *         making the connection.
     *         <p>
     *         If this parameter is {@code null}, it means that this {@code ConnectionService} is
     *         being asked to make a direct connection. The
     *         {@link ConnectionRequest#getAccountHandle()} of parameter {@code request} will be
     *         a {@code PhoneAccount} registered by this {@code ConnectionService} to use for
     *         making the connection.
     * @param request Details about the outgoing call.
     * @return The {@code Conference} object to satisfy this call, or the result of an invocation
     *         of {@link Connection#createFailedConnection(DisconnectCause)} to not handle the call.
