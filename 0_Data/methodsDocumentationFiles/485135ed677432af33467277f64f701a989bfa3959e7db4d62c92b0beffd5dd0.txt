     * Attempts to delete the cache files associated with an application.
     * Since this may take a little while, the result will
     * be posted back to the given observer.  A deletion will fail if the calling context
     * lacks the {@link android.Manifest.permission#DELETE_CACHE_FILES} permission, if the
     * named package cannot be found, or if the named package is a "system package".
     *
     * @param packageName The name of the package to delete
     * @param observer An observer callback to get notified when the cache file deletion
     * is complete.
     * {@link android.content.pm.IPackageDataObserver#onRemoveCompleted(String, boolean)}
     * will be called when that happens.  observer may be null to indicate that
     * no callback is desired.
