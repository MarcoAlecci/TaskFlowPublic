     * Indicates whether network connectivity exists or is in the process
     * of being established. This is good for applications that need to
     * do anything related to the network other than read or write data.
     * For the latter, call {@link #isConnected()} instead, which guarantees
     * that the network is fully usable.
     * @return {@code true} if network connectivity exists or is in the process
     * of being established, {@code false} otherwise.
     * @deprecated Apps should instead use the
     *             {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback} API to
     *             learn about connectivity changes.
     *             {@link ConnectivityManager#registerDefaultNetworkCallback} and
     *             {@link ConnectivityManager#registerNetworkCallback}. These will
     *             give a more accurate picture of the connectivity state of
     *             the device and let apps react more easily and quickly to changes.
