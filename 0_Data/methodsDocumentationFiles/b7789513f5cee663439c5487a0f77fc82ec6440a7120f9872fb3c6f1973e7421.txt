     * Registers a callback to receive notifications when MIDI devices are added and removed.
     *
     * The {@link  DeviceCallback#onDeviceStatusChanged} method will be called immediately
     * for any devices that have open ports. This allows applications to know which input
     * ports are already in use and, therefore, unavailable.
     *
     * Applications should call {@link #getDevices} before registering the callback
     * to get a list of devices already added.
     *
     * @param callback a {@link DeviceCallback} for MIDI device notifications
     * @param handler The {@link android.os.Handler Handler} that will be used for delivering the
     *                device notifications. If handler is null, then the thread used for the
     *                callback is unspecified.
