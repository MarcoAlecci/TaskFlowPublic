     * Report to the system that your app is now fully drawn, for diagnostic and
     * optimization purposes.  The system may adjust optimizations to prioritize
     * work that happens before reportFullyDrawn is called, to improve app startup.
     * Misrepresenting the startup window by calling reportFullyDrawn too late or too
     * early may decrease application and startup performance.<p>
     * This is also used to help instrument application launch times, so that the
     * app can report when it is fully in a usable state; without this, the only thing
     * the system itself can determine is the point at which the activity's window
     * is <em>first</em> drawn and displayed.  To participate in app launch time
     * measurement, you should always call this method after first launch (when
     * {@link #onCreate(android.os.Bundle)} is called), at the point where you have
     * entirely drawn your UI and populated with all of the significant data.  You
     * can safely call this method any time after first launch as well, in which case
     * it will simply be ignored.
     * <p>If this method is called before the activity's window is <em>first</em> drawn
     * and displayed as measured by the system, the reported time here will be shifted
     * to the system measured time.
