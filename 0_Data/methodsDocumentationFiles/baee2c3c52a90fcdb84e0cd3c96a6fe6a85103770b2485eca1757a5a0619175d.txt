     * Compute an approximation for how much time (in microseconds) remains until the battery
     * is fully charged.  Returns -1 if no time can be computed: either there is not
     * enough current data to make a decision, or the battery is currently
     * discharging.
     *
     * @param curTime The current elepsed realtime in microseconds.
