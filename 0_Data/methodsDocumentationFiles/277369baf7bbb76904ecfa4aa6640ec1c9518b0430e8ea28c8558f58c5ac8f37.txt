         * Invoked when the post-dial sequence in the outgoing {@code Call} has reached a pause
         * character. This causes the post-dial signals to stop pending user confirmation. An
         * implementation should present this choice to the user and invoke
         * {@link #postDialContinue(boolean)} when the user makes the choice.
         *
         * @param call The {@code Call} invoking this method.
         * @param remainingPostDialSequence The post-dial characters that remain to be sent.
