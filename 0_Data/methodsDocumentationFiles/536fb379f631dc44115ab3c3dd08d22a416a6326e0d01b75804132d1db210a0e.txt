     * use by system services to store files relating to the user. This
     * directory supports fast user wipe, and will be automatically deleted when
     * the user is removed.
     * <p>
     * Data stored under this path is "device encrypted", which uses an
     * encryption key that is tied to the physical device. The contents will
     * only be available once the device has finished a {@code dm-verity}
     * protected boot.
     * <p>
     * New code should <em>strongly</em> avoid storing sensitive data in these
     * device encrypted areas.
