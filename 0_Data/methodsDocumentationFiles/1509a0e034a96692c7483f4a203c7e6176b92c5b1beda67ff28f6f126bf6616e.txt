     * Retrieve a parser for a compiled XML file. This is associated with a single APK and
     * <em>NOT</em> a full AssetManager. This means that shared-library references will not be
     * dynamically assigned runtime package IDs.
     *
     * @param fileName The path to the file within the APK.
     * @return An XmlResourceParser.
     * @throws IOException if the file was not found or an error occurred retrieving it.
