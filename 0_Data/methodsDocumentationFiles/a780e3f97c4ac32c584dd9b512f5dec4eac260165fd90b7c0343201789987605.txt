     * Specify a set of states for the drawable. These are use-case specific,
     * so see the relevant documentation. As an example, the background for
     * widgets like Button understand the following states:
     * [{@link android.R.attr#state_focused},
     *  {@link android.R.attr#state_pressed}].
     *
     * <p>If the new state you are supplying causes the appearance of the
     * Drawable to change, then it is responsible for calling
     * {@link #invalidateSelf} in order to have itself redrawn, <em>and</em>
     * true will be returned from this function.
     *
     * <p>Note: The Drawable holds a reference on to <var>stateSet</var>
     * until a new state array is given to it, so you must not modify this
     * array during that time.</p>
     *
     * @param stateSet The new set of states to be displayed.
     *
     * @return Returns true if this change in state has caused the appearance
     * of the Drawable to change (hence requiring an invalidate), otherwise
     * returns false.
