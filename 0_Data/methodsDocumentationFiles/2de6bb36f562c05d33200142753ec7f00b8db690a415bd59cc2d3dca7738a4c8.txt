     * Compares this {@code LinkProperties} instance against the target
     * LinkProperties in {@code obj}. Two LinkPropertieses are equal if
     * all their fields are equal in values.
     *
     * For collection fields, such as mDnses, containsAll() is used to check
     * if two collections contains the same elements, independent of order.
     * There are two thoughts regarding containsAll()
     * 1. Duplicated elements. eg, (A, B, B) and (A, A, B) are equal.
     * 2. Worst case performance is O(n^2).
     *
     * @param obj the object to be tested for equality.
     * @return {@code true} if both objects are equal, {@code false} otherwise.
