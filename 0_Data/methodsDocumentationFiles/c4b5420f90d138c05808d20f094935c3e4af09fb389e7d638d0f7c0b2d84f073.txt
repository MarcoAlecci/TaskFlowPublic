     * <p>This will be called when this service is initially bound, but is not
     * guaranteed to be called before onUnbind.  In general, this is intended to be used to
     * determine when user focus has transitioned between two VR activities.  If both activities
     * have declared {@link android.R.attr#enableVrMode} with this service (and this
     * service is present and enabled), this service will not be unbound during the activity
     * transition.</p>
     *
     * @param component the {@link ComponentName} of the VR activity that the system has
     *    switched to, or null if the system is displaying a 2D activity in VR compatibility mode.
