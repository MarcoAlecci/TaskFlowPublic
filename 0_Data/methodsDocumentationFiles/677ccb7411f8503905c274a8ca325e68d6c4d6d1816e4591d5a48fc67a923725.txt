     * Make a token.
     * Bits 61-63 - tag size (So we can go backwards later if the object had not data)
     *            - 3 bits, max value 7, max value needed 5
     * Bit  60    - true if the object is repeated (lets us require endObject or endRepeatedObject)
     * Bits 59-51 - depth (For error checking)
     *            - 9 bits, max value 512, when checking, value is masked (if we really
     *              are more than 512 levels deep)
     * Bits 32-50 - objectId (For error checking)
     *            - 19 bits, max value 524,288. that's a lot of objects. IDs will wrap
     *              because of the overflow, and only the tokens are compared.
     * Bits  0-31 - offset of interest for the object.
