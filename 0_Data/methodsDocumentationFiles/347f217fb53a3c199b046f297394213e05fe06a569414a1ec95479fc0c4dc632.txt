     * Determine whether the typeface set on the paint has a glyph supporting the string. The
     * simplest case is when the string contains a single character, in which this method
     * determines whether the font has the character. In the case of multiple characters, the
     * method returns true if there is a single glyph representing the ligature. For example, if
     * the input is a pair of regional indicator symbols, determine whether there is an emoji flag
     * for the pair.
     *
     * <p>Finally, if the string contains a variation selector, the method only returns true if
     * the fonts contains a glyph specific to that variation.
     *
     * <p>Checking is done on the entire fallback chain, not just the immediate font referenced.
     *
     * @param string the string to test whether there is glyph support
     * @return true if the typeface has a glyph for the string
