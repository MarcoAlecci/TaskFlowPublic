     * Launch a new activity.  You will not receive any information about when
     * the activity exits.
     *
     * <p>Note that if this method is being called from outside of an
     * {@link android.app.Activity} Context, then the Intent must include
     * the {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} launch flag.  This is because,
     * without being started from an existing Activity, there is no existing
     * task in which to place the new activity and thus it needs to be placed
     * in its own separate task.
     *
     * <p>This method throws {@link ActivityNotFoundException}
     * if there was no Activity found to run the given Intent.
     *
     * @param intent The description of the activity to start.
     * @param options Additional options for how the Activity should be started.
     * May be null if there are no options.  See {@link android.app.ActivityOptions}
     * for how to build the Bundle supplied here; there are no supported definitions
     * for building it manually.
