     * Sets whether the bitmap should treat its data as pre-multiplied.
     *
     * <p>Bitmaps are always treated as pre-multiplied by the view system and
     * {@link Canvas} for performance reasons. Storing un-pre-multiplied data in
     * a Bitmap (through {@link #setPixel}, {@link #setPixels}, or {@link
     * BitmapFactory.Options#inPremultiplied BitmapFactory.Options.inPremultiplied})
     * can lead to incorrect blending if drawn by the framework.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method will not affect the behavior of a bitmap without an alpha
     * channel, or if {@link #hasAlpha()} returns false.</p>
     *
     * <p>Calling {@link #createBitmap} or {@link #createScaledBitmap} with a source
     * Bitmap whose colors are not pre-multiplied may result in a RuntimeException,
     * since those functions require drawing the source, which is not supported for
     * un-pre-multiplied Bitmaps.</p>
