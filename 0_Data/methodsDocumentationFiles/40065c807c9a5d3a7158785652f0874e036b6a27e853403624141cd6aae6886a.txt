     * Handle the data delivered via the given file descriptor during a full restore
     * operation.  The agent is given the path to the file's original location as well
     * as its size and metadata.
     * <p>
     * The file descriptor can only be read for {@code size} bytes; attempting to read
     * more data has undefined behavior.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation creates the destination file/directory and populates it
     * with the data from the file descriptor, then sets the file's access mode and
     * modification time to match the restore arguments.
     *
     * @param data A read-only file descriptor from which the agent can read {@code size}
     *     bytes of file data.
     * @param size The number of bytes of file content to be restored to the given
     *     destination.  If the file system object being restored is a directory, {@code size}
     *     will be zero.
     * @param destination The File on disk to be restored with the given data.
     * @param type The kind of file system object being restored.  This will be either
     *     {@link BackupAgent#TYPE_FILE} or {@link BackupAgent#TYPE_DIRECTORY}.
     * @param mode The access mode to be assigned to the destination after its data is
     *     written.  This is in the standard format used by {@code chmod()}.
     * @param mtime The modification time of the file when it was backed up, suitable to
     *     be assigned to the file after its data is written.
     * @throws IOException
