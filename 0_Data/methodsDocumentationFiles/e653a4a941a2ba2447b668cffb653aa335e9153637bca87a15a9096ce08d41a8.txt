     * Start executing an {@link android.app.Instrumentation} class.  The given
     * Instrumentation component will be run by killing its target application
     * (if currently running), starting the target process, instantiating the
     * instrumentation component, and then letting it drive the application.
     *
     * <p>This function is not synchronous -- it returns as soon as the
     * instrumentation has started and while it is running.
     *
     * <p>Instrumentation is normally only allowed to run against a package
     * that is either unsigned or signed with a signature that the
     * the instrumentation package is also signed with (ensuring the target
     * trusts the instrumentation).
     *
     * @param className Name of the Instrumentation component to be run.
     * @param profileFile Optional path to write profiling data as the
     * instrumentation runs, or null for no profiling.
     * @param arguments Additional optional arguments to pass to the
     * instrumentation, or null.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the instrumentation was successfully started,
     * else {@code false} if it could not be found.
