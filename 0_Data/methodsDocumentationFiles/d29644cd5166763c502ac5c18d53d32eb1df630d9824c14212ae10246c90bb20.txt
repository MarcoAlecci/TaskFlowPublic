     * Gets the RF phase detected by the receiver.
     * Range: [0.0, 1.0].
     * This is usually the fractional part of the complete carrier phase measurement.
     *
     * The reference frequency is given by the value of {@link #getCarrierFrequencyInHz()}.
     * The reported carrier-phase includes {@link #getCarrierPhaseUncertainty()}.
     *
     * The value is only available if {@link #hasCarrierPhase()} is true.
