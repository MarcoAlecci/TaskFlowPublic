     * an assist session is started.  If the original show request did not specify
     * {@link #SHOW_WITH_ASSIST}, this method will not be called.
     *
     * <p>This method is called for all activities along with an index and count that indicates
     * which activity the data is for. {@code index} will be between 0 and {@code count}-1 and
     * this method is called once for each activity in no particular order. The {@code count}
     * indicates how many activities to expect assist data for, including the top focused one.
     * The focused activity can be determined by calling {@link AssistState#isFocused()}.
     *
     * <p>To be responsive to assist requests, process assist data as soon as it is received,
     * without waiting for all queued activities to return assist data.
