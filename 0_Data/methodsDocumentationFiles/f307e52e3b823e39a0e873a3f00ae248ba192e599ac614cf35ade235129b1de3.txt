     * Sets the TimeInterpolator for all current {@link #getChildAnimations() child animations}
     * of this AnimatorSet. The default value is null, which means that no interpolator
     * is set on this AnimatorSet. Setting the interpolator to any non-null value
     * will cause that interpolator to be set on the child animations
     * when the set is started.

     * @param interpolator the interpolator to be used by each child animation of this AnimatorSet
