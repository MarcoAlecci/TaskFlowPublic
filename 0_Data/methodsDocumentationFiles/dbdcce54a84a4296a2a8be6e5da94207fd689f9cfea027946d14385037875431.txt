     * This hook is called to launch the search UI.
     *
     * <p>It is typically called from onSearchRequested(), either directly from
     * Activity.onSearchRequested() or from an overridden version in any given
     * Activity.  If your goal is simply to activate search, it is preferred to call
     * onSearchRequested(), which may have been overridden elsewhere in your Activity.  If your goal
     * is to inject specific data such as context data, it is preferred to <i>override</i>
     * onSearchRequested(), so that any callers to it will benefit from the override.
     *
     * <p>Note: when running in a {@link Configuration#UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH}, use of this API is
     * not supported.
     *
     * @param initialQuery Any non-null non-empty string will be inserted as
     * pre-entered text in the search query box.
     * @param selectInitialQuery If true, the initial query will be preselected, which means that
     * any further typing will replace it.  This is useful for cases where an entire pre-formed
     * query is being inserted.  If false, the selection point will be placed at the end of the
     * inserted query.  This is useful when the inserted query is text that the user entered,
     * and the user would expect to be able to keep typing.  <i>This parameter is only meaningful
     * if initialQuery is a non-empty string.</i>
     * @param appSearchData An application can insert application-specific
     * context here, in order to improve quality or specificity of its own
     * searches.  This data will be returned with SEARCH intent(s).  Null if
     * no extra data is required.
     * @param globalSearch If false, this will only launch the search that has been specifically
     * defined by the application (which is usually defined as a local search).  If no default
     * search is defined in the current application or activity, global search will be launched.
     * If true, this will always launch a platform-global (e.g. web-based) search instead.
