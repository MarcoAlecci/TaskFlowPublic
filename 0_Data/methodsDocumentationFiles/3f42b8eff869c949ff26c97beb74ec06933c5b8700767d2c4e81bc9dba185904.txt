     * to reverse its exit Transition. When the exit Transition completes,
     * {@link #finish()} is called. If no entry Transition was used, finish() is called
     * immediately and the Activity exit Transition is run.
     * @see android.app.ActivityOptions#makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity, android.util.Pair[])
