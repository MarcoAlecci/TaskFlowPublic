         * Returns the face's pose. That is, the rotations around either 
         * the X, Y or Z axis (the positions in 3-dimensional Euclidean space).
         * 
         * @param euler the Euler axis to retrieve an angle from 
         *              (<var>EULER_X</var>, <var>EULER_Y</var> or 
         *              <var>EULER_Z</var>)
         * @return the Euler angle of the of the face, for the given axis
