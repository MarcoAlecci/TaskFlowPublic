     * Returns the data passed from the current administrator to the new administrator during an
     * ownership transfer. This is the same {@code bundle} passed in
     * {@link #transferOwnership(ComponentName, ComponentName, PersistableBundle)}. The bundle is
     * persisted until the profile owner or device owner is removed.
     *
     * <p>This is the same <code>bundle</code> received in the
     * {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#onTransferOwnershipComplete(Context, PersistableBundle)}.
     * Use this method to retrieve it after the transfer as long as the new administrator is the
     * active device or profile owner.
     *
     * <p>Returns <code>null</code> if no ownership transfer was started for the calling user.
