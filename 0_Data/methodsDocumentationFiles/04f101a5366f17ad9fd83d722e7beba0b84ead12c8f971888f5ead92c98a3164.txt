     * <p>By default, this method returns a <i>connected</i> socket and verifies the peer's
     * certificate hostname after connecting using the {@link HostnameVerifier} obtained from
     * {@code HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier()}; if this instance was created with
     * {@link #getInsecure(int, SSLSessionCache)}, it returns a socket that is <i>not connected</i>
     * instead.
