     * Compare two {@code Time} objects and return a negative number if {@code
     * a} is less than {@code b}, a positive number if {@code a} is greater than
     * {@code b}, or 0 if they are equal.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method can return an incorrect answer when the date / time fields of
     * either {@code Time} have been set to a local time that contradicts the
     * available timezone information.
     *
     * @param a first {@code Time} instance to compare
     * @param b second {@code Time} instance to compare
     * @throws NullPointerException if either argument is {@code null}
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@link #allDay} is true but {@code
     *             hour}, {@code minute}, and {@code second} are not 0.
     * @return a negative result if {@code a} is earlier, a positive result if
     *         {@code b} is earlier, or 0 if they are equal.
