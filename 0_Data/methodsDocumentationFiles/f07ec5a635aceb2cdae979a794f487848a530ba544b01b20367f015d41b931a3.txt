     * Called to receive data from other applications that the user was or is interacting with,
     * that are currently on the screen in a multi-window display environment, not including the
     * currently focused activity. This could be
     * a free-form window, a picture-in-picture window, or another window in a split-screen display.
     * <p>
     * This method is very similar to
     * {@link #onHandleAssist} except that it is called
     * for additional non-focused activities along with an index and count that indicates
     * which additional activity the data is for. {@code index} will be between 1 and
     * {@code count}-1 and this method is called once for each additional window, in no particular
     * order. The {@code count} indicates how many windows to expect assist data for, including the
     * top focused activity, which continues to be returned via {@link #onHandleAssist}.
     * <p>
     * To be responsive to assist requests, process assist data as soon as it is received,
     * without waiting for all queued activities to return assist data.
     *
     * @param data Arbitrary data supplied by the app through
     * {@link android.app.Activity#onProvideAssistData Activity.onProvideAssistData}.
     * May be null if assist data has been disabled by the user or device policy.
     * @param structure If available, the structure definition of all windows currently
     * displayed by the app.  May be null if assist data has been disabled by the user
     * or device policy; will be an empty stub if the application has disabled assist
     * by marking its window as secure.
     * @param content Additional content data supplied by the app through
     * {@link android.app.Activity#onProvideAssistContent Activity.onProvideAssistContent}.
     * May be null if assist data has been disabled by the user or device policy; will
     * not be automatically filled in with data from the app if the app has marked its
     * window as secure.
     * @param index the index of the additional activity that this data
     *        is for.
     * @param count the total number of additional activities for which the assist data is being
     *        returned, including the focused activity that is returned via
     *        {@link #onHandleAssist}.
     *
     * @deprecated use {@link #onHandleAssist(AssistState)}
