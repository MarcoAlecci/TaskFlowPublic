     * Returns all the addresses on this link.  We often think of a link having a single address,
     * however, particularly with Ipv6 several addresses are typical.  Note that the
     * {@code LinkProperties} actually contains {@link LinkAddress} objects which also include
     * prefix lengths for each address.  This is a simplified utility alternative to
     * {@link LinkProperties#getLinkAddresses}.
     *
     * @return An unmodifiable {@link List} of {@link InetAddress} for this link.
