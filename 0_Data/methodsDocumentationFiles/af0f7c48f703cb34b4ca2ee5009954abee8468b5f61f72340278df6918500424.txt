     * Set whether this Drawable is visible.  This generally does not impact
     * the Drawable's behavior, but is a hint that can be used by some
     * Drawables, for example, to decide whether run animations.
     *
     * @param visible Set to true if visible, false if not.
     * @param restart You can supply true here to force the drawable to behave
     *                as if it has just become visible, even if it had last
     *                been set visible.  Used for example to force animations
     *                to restart.
     *
     * @return boolean Returns true if the new visibility is different than
     *         its previous state.
