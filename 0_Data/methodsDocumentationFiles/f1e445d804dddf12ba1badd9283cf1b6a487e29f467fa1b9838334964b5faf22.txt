     * Returns the value of the setting for background data usage. If false,
     * applications should not use the network if the application is not in the
     * foreground. Developers should respect this setting, and check the value
     * of this before performing any background data operations.
     * <p>
     * All applications that have background services that use the network
     * should listen to {@link #ACTION_BACKGROUND_DATA_SETTING_CHANGED}.
     * <p>
     * @deprecated As of {@link VERSION_CODES#ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH}, availability of
     * background data depends on several combined factors, and this method will
     * always return {@code true}. Instead, when background data is unavailable,
     * {@link #getActiveNetworkInfo()} will now appear disconnected.
     *
     * @return Whether background data usage is allowed.
