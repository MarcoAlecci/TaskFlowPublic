     * Sets the alpha represented by the Outline - the degree to which the
     * producer is guaranteed to be opaque over the Outline's shape.
     * <p>
     * An alpha value of <code>0.0f</code> either represents completely
     * transparent content, or content that isn't guaranteed to fill the shape
     * it publishes.
     * <p>
     * Content producing a fully opaque (alpha = <code>1.0f</code>) outline is
     * assumed by the drawing system to fully cover content beneath it,
     * meaning content beneath may be optimized away.
