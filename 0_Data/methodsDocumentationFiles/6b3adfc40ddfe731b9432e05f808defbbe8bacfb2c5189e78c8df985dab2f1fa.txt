     *  Request audio focus.
     *  Send a request to obtain the audio focus
     *  @param l the listener to be notified of audio focus changes
     *  @param streamType the main audio stream type affected by the focus request
     *  @param durationHint use {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT} to indicate this focus request
     *      is temporary, and focus will be abandonned shortly. Examples of transient requests are
     *      for the playback of driving directions, or notifications sounds.
     *      Use {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK} to indicate also that it's ok for
     *      the previous focus owner to keep playing if it ducks its audio output.
     *      Alternatively use {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_EXCLUSIVE} for a temporary request
     *      that benefits from the system not playing disruptive sounds like notifications, for
     *      usecases such as voice memo recording, or speech recognition.
     *      Use {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN} for a focus request of unknown duration such
     *      as the playback of a song or a video.
     *  @return {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_FAILED} or {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_GRANTED}
     *  @deprecated use {@link #requestAudioFocus(AudioFocusRequest)}
