     * Sets the Dual Mono mode presentation on the output device.
     *
     * The Dual Mono mode is generally applied to stereo audio streams
     * where the left and right channels come from separate sources.
     *
     * For compressed audio, where the decoding is done in hardware,
     * Dual Mono presentation needs to be performed
     * by the hardware output device
     * as the PCM audio is not available to the framework.

     * @return true on success, false on failure if the output device
     *     does not support Dual Mono mode.
