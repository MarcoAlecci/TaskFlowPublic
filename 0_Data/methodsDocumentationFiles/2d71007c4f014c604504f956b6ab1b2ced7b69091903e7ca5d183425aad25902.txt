     * Sets this as the main {@link TvView}.
     *
     * <p>The main {@link TvView} is a {@link TvView} whose corresponding TV input determines the
     * HDMI-CEC active source device. For an HDMI port input, one of source devices that is
     * connected to that HDMI port becomes the active source. For an HDMI-CEC logical device input,
     * the corresponding HDMI-CEC logical device becomes the active source. For any non-HDMI input
     * (including the tuner, composite, S-Video, etc.), the internal device (= TV itself) becomes
     * the active source.
     *
     * <p>First tuned {@link TvView} becomes main automatically, and keeps to be main until either
     * {@link #reset} is called for the main {@link TvView} or {@code setMain()} is called for other
     * {@link TvView}.
