     * Based on saveFlags, can save the current matrix and clip onto a private
     * stack.
     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> if possible, use the
     * parameter-less save(). It is simpler and faster than individually
     * disabling the saving of matrix or clip with this method.
     * <p>
     * Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect,
     * clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to
     * restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that
     * existed before the save() will be reinstated.

     * @param saveFlags flag bits that specify which parts of the Canvas state
     *                  to save/restore
     * @return The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
