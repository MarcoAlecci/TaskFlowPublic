     * Start an activity to resolve a user-resolvable error.
     *
     * <p>If an operation returns {@link #EMBEDDED_SUBSCRIPTION_RESULT_RESOLVABLE_ERROR}, this
     * method may be called to prompt the user to resolve the issue.
     *
     * <p>This method may only be called once for a particular error.
     *
     * @param activity the calling activity (which should be in the foreground).
     * @param requestCode an application-specific request code which will be provided to
     *     {@link Activity#onActivityResult} upon completion. Note that the operation may still be
     *     in progress when the resolution activity completes; it is not fully finished until the
     *     callback intent is triggered.
     * @param resultIntent the Intent provided to the initial callback intent which failed with
     *     {@link #EMBEDDED_SUBSCRIPTION_RESULT_RESOLVABLE_ERROR}.
     * @param callbackIntent a PendingIntent to launch when the operation completes. This is
     *     trigered upon completion of the original operation that required user resolution.
     * @throws android.content.IntentSender.SendIntentException if called more than once.
