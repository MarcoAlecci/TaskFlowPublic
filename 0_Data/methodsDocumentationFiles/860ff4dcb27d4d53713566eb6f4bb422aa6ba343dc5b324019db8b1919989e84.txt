     * Returns the native frame's Object value.
     *
     * If the frame's base-type is not TYPE_OBJECT, this returns a data buffer containing the native
     * data (this is equivalent to calling getData().
     * If the frame is based on an object type, this type is expected to be a subclass of
     * NativeBuffer. The NativeBuffer returned is only valid for as long as the frame is alive. If
     * you need to hold on to the returned value, you must retain it.
