     * Like {@link #newChild}, but allows the caller to asynchronously populate the returned
     * child.  It can transfer the returned {@link ViewStructure} to another thread for it
     * to build its content (and children etc).  Once done, some thread must call
     * {@link #asyncCommit} to tell the containing {@link ViewStructure} that the async
     * population is done.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE: </b>you must pre-allocate space for the child first, by calling either
     * {@link #addChildCount(int)} or {@link #setChildCount(int)}.
     *
     * @return Returns an fresh {@link ViewStructure} ready to be filled in.
