     * Formats a date-time object to an {@code Appendable} using this formatter.
     * <p>
     * This outputs the formatted date-time to the specified destination.
     * {@link Appendable} is a general purpose interface that is implemented by all
     * key character output classes including {@code StringBuffer}, {@code StringBuilder},
     * {@code PrintStream} and {@code Writer}.
     * <p>
     * Although {@code Appendable} methods throw an {@code IOException}, this method does not.
     * Instead, any {@code IOException} is wrapped in a runtime exception.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to format, not null
     * @param appendable  the appendable to format to, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if an error occurs during formatting
