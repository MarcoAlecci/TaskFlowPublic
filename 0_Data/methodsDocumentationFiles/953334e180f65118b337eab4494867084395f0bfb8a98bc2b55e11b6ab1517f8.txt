         * <p>When wearable actions are added using this method, the set of actions that
         * show on a wearable device splits from devices that only show actions added
         * using {@link android.app.Notification.Builder#addAction}. This allows for customization
         * of which actions display on different devices.

         * @param action the action to add to this notification
         * @return this object for method chaining
