     * The service may call this method to provide timing information about the spoken text.
     *
     * <p>Calling this method means that at the given audio frame, the given range of the input is
     * about to be spoken. If this method is called the client will receive a callback on the
     * listener ({@link UtteranceProgressListener#onRangeStart}) at the moment that frame has been
     * reached by the playback head.
     *
     * <p>This information can be used by the client, for example, to highlight ranges of the text
     * while it is spoken.
     *
     * <p>The markerInFrames is a frame index into the audio for this synthesis request, i.e. into
     * the concatenation of the audio bytes sent to audioAvailable for this synthesis request. The
     * definition of a frame depends on the format given by {@link #start}. See {@link AudioFormat}
     * for more information.
     *
     * <p>This method should only be called on the synthesis thread, while in {@link
     * TextToSpeechService#onSynthesizeText}.
     *
     * @param markerInFrames The position in frames in the audio where this range is spoken.
     * @param start The start index of the range in the input text.
     * @param end The end index (exclusive) of the range in the input text.
