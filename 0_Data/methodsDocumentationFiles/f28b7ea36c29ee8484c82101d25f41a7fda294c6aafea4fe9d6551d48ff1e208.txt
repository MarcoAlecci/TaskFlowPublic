     * {@link #TETHER_ERROR_NO_ERROR} or showEntitlementUi argument is false, it just return the
     * cached value. Otherwise, a UI-based entitlement check would be performed. It is not
     * guaranteed that the UI-based entitlement check will complete in any specific time period
     * and may in fact never complete. Any successful entitlement check the platform performs for
     * any reason will update the cached value.

     * @param executor the executor on which callback will be invoked.
     * @param listener an {@link OnTetheringEntitlementResultListener} which will be called to
