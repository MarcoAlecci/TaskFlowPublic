     * Writes a trace message to indicate that a given section of code has
     * begun. Must be followed by a call to {@link #asyncTraceEnd} using the same
     * tag. Unlike {@link #traceBegin(long, String)} and {@link #traceEnd(long)},
     * asynchronous events do not need to be nested. The name and cookie used to
     * begin an event must be used to end it.
     *
     * @param traceTag The trace tag.
     * @param methodName The method name to appear in the trace.
     * @param cookie Unique identifier for distinguishing simultaneous events
     *
     * @hide
