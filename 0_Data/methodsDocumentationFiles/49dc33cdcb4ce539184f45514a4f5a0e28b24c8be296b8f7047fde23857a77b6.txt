     * can be referenced in subsequent capture requests.</p>
     *
     * <p>Surfaces that get removed must not be part of any active repeating or single/burst
     * request or have any pending results. Consider updating any repeating requests first via
     * {@link #setRepeatingRequest} or {@link #setRepeatingBurst} and then wait for the last frame
     * number when the sequence completes {@link CaptureCallback#onCaptureSequenceCompleted}
     * before calling updateOutputConfiguration to remove a previously active Surface.</p>
     *
     * <p>Surfaces that get added must not be part of any other registered
     * {@link OutputConfiguration}.</p>
