         * Invoked when a {@link Call} receives an event from its associated {@link Connection} or
         * {@link Conference}.
         * <p>
         * Where possible, the Call should make an attempt to handle {@link Connection} events which
         * are part of the {@code android.telecom.*} namespace.  The Call should ignore any events
         * it does not wish to handle.  Unexpected events should be handled gracefully, as it is
         * possible that a {@link ConnectionService} has defined its own Connection events which a
         * Call is not aware of.
         * <p>
         * See {@link Connection#sendConnectionEvent(String, Bundle)},
         * {@link Conference#sendConferenceEvent(String, Bundle)}.
         *
         * @param call The {@code Call} receiving the event.
         * @param event The event.
         * @param extras Extras associated with the connection event.
