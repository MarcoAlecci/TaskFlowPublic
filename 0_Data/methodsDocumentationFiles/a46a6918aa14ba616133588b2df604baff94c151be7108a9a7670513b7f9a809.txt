         * Pss of Java Heap bytes in KB due to the application.
         * Notes:
         *  * OTHER_ART is the boot image. Anything private here is blamed on
         *    the application, not the system.
         *  * dalvikPrivateDirty includes private zygote, which means the
         *    application dirtied something allocated by the zygote. We blame
         *    the application for that memory, not the system.
         *  * Does not include OTHER_DALVIK_OTHER, which is considered VM
         *    Overhead and lumped into Private Other.
         *  * We don't include dalvikPrivateClean, because there should be no
         *    such thing as private clean for the Java Heap.
