     * Returns {@code true} if the current device's {@code KeyChain} binds any
     * {@code PrivateKey} of the given {@code algorithm} to the device once
     * imported or generated. This can be used to tell if there is special
     * hardware support that can be used to bind keys to the device in a way
     * that makes it non-exportable.
     *
     * @deprecated Whether the key is bound to the secure hardware is known only
     * once the key has been imported. To find out, use:
     * <pre>{@code
     * PrivateKey key = ...; // private key from KeyChain
     *
     * KeyFactory keyFactory =
     *     KeyFactory.getInstance(key.getAlgorithm(), "AndroidKeyStore");
     * KeyInfo keyInfo = keyFactory.getKeySpec(key, KeyInfo.class);
     * if (keyInfo.isInsideSecureHardware()) {
     *     // The key is bound to the secure hardware of this Android
     * }}</pre>
