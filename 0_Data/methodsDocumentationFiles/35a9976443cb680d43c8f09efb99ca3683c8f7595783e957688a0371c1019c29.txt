     * Sets the height of the TextView to be at least {@code minPixels} tall.
     * <p>
     * This value is used for height calculation if LayoutParams does not force TextView to have an
     * exact height. Setting this value overrides previous minimum height configurations such as
     * {@link #setMinLines(int)} or {@link #setLines(int)}.
     * <p>
     * The value given here is different than {@link #setMinimumHeight(int)}. Between
     * {@code minHeight} and the value set in {@link #setMinimumHeight(int)}, the greater one is
     * used to decide the final height.
     *
     * @param minPixels the minimum height of TextView in terms of pixels
