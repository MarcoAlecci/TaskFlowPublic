     * Override this to intercept key up events before they are processed by the
     * application.  If you return true, the application will not itself
     * process the event.  If you return false, the normal application processing
     * will occur as if the IME had not seen the event at all.
     * 
     * <p>The default implementation intercepts {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_BACK
     * KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK} to hide the current IME UI if it is shown.  In
     * addition, in fullscreen mode only, it will consume DPAD movement
     * events to move the cursor in the extracted text view, not allowing
     * them to perform navigation in the underlying application.
