         * Returns the current span index of this View. If the View is not laid out yet, the return
         * value is <code>undefined</code>.
         * <p>
         * Starting with RecyclerView <b>24.2.0</b>, span indices are always indexed from position 0
         * even if the layout is RTL. In a vertical GridLayoutManager, <b>leftmost</b> span is span
         * 0 if the layout is <b>LTR</b> and <b>rightmost</b> span is span 0 if the layout is
         * <b>RTL</b>. Prior to 24.2.0, it was the opposite which was conflicting with
         * {@link SpanSizeLookup#getSpanIndex(int, int)}.
         * <p>
         * If the View occupies multiple spans, span with the minimum index is returned.
         *
         * @return The span index of the View.
