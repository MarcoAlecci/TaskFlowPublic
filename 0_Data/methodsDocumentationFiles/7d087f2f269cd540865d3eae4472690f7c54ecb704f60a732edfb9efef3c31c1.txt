     * Returns the length of the value's two's complement representation without
     * leading zeros for positive numbers / without leading ones for negative
     * values.
     *
     * <p>The two's complement representation of {@code this} will be at least
     * {@code bitLength() + 1} bits long.
     *
     * <p>The value will fit into an {@code int} if {@code bitLength() < 32} or
     * into a {@code long} if {@code bitLength() < 64}.
     *
     * @return the length of the minimal two's complement representation for
     *     {@code this} without the sign bit.
