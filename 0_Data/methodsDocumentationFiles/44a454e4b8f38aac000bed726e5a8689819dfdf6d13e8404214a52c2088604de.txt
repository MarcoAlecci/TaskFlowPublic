     * Notifies that the accessibility state of this view changed. The change
     * is *not* local to this view and does represent structural changes such
     * as children and parent. For example, the view size changed. The
     * notification is at at most once every
     * {@link ViewConfiguration#getSendRecurringAccessibilityEventsInterval()}
     * to avoid unnecessary load to the system. Also once a view has a pending
     * notification this method is a NOP until the notification has been sent.
