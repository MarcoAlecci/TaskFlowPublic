     * Gets the clock's time Uncertainty (1-Sigma) in nanoseconds.
     *
     * <p>The uncertainty is represented as an absolute (single sided) value.
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasTimeUncertaintyNanos()} is {@code true}.
     *
     * <p>This value is often effectively zero (it is the reference clock by which all other times
     * and time uncertainties are measured), and thus this field may often be 0, or not provided.
