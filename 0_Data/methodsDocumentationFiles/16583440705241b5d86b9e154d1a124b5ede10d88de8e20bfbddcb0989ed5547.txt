     * This method is called by ViewGroup when there is a call to layout() on the container
     * with this LayoutTransition. If the CHANGING transition is enabled and if there is no other
     * transition currently running on the container, then this call runs a CHANGING transition.
     * The transition does not start immediately; it just sets up the mechanism to run if any
     * of the children of the container change their layout parameters (similar to
     * the CHANGE_APPEARING and CHANGE_DISAPPEARING transitions).
     *
     * @param parent The ViewGroup whose layout() method has been called.
