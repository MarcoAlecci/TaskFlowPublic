     * Add a new Intent category to match against.  The semantics of
     * categories is the opposite of actions -- an Intent includes the
     * categories that it requires, all of which must be included in the
     * filter in order to match.  In other words, adding a category to the
     * filter has no impact on matching unless that category is specified in
     * the intent.
     *
     * @param category Name of category to match, such as Intent.CATEGORY_EMBED.
