 Helper function to convert a rotation vector to a normalized quaternion.
     *  Given a rotation vector (presumably from a ROTATION_VECTOR sensor), returns a normalized
     *  quaternion in the array Q.  The quaternion is stored as [w, x, y, z]
     *  @param rv the rotation vector to convert
     *  @param Q an array of floats in which to store the computed quaternion
