     * Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the
     * given condition associated with this synchronizer. Note that
     * because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the
     * estimate serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of
     * waiters.  This method is designed for use in monitoring system
     * state, not for synchronization control.
     *
     * @param condition the condition
     * @return the estimated number of waiting threads
     * @throws IllegalMonitorStateException if exclusive synchronization
     *         is not held
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the given condition is
     *         not associated with this synchronizer
     * @throws NullPointerException if the condition is null
