     * Ask the transport to provide data for the "current" package being restored.  This
     * is the package that was just reported by {@link #nextRestorePackage()} as having
     * {@link RestoreDescription#TYPE_FULL_STREAM} data.
     *
     * The transport writes some data to the socket supplied to this call, and returns
     * the number of bytes written.  The system will then read that many bytes and
     * stream them to the application's agent for restore, then will call this method again
     * to receive the next chunk of the archive.  This sequence will be repeated until the
     * transport returns zero indicating that all of the package's data has been delivered
     * (or returns a negative value indicating some sort of hard error condition at the
     * transport level).
     *
     * <p>After this method returns zero, the system will then call
     * {@link #nextRestorePackage()} to begin the restore process for the next
     * application, and the sequence begins again.
     *
     * <p>The transport should always close this socket when returning from this method.
     * Do not cache this socket across multiple calls or you may leak file descriptors.
     *
     * @param socket The file descriptor that the transport will use for delivering the
     *    streamed archive.  The transport must close this socket in all cases when returning
     *    from this method.
     * @return {@link #NO_MORE_DATA} when no more data for the current package is available.
     *    A positive value indicates the presence of that many bytes to be delivered to the app.
     *    A value of zero indicates that no data was deliverable at this time, but the restore
     *    is still running and the caller should retry.  {@link #TRANSPORT_PACKAGE_REJECTED}
     *    means that the current package's restore operation should be aborted, but that
     *    the transport itself is still in a good state and so a multiple-package restore
     *    sequence can still be continued.  Any other negative return value is treated as a
     *    fatal error condition that aborts all further restore operations on the current dataset.
