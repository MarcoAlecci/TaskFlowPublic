     * If this view doesn't do any drawing on its own, set this flag to
     * allow further optimizations. By default, this flag is not set on
     * View, but could be set on some View subclasses such as ViewGroup.
     *
     * Typically, if you override {@link #onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)}
     * you should clear this flag.

     * @param willNotDraw whether or not this View draw on its own
