         * Sets attributes as inferred from the legacy stream types.
         * Warning: do not use this method in combination with setting any other attributes such as
         * usage, content type, flags or haptic control, as this method will overwrite (the more
         * accurate) information describing the use case previously set in the <code>Builder</code>.
         * In general, avoid using it and prefer setting usage and content type directly
         * with {@link #setUsage(int)} and {@link #setContentType(int)}.
         * <p>Use this method when building an {@link AudioAttributes} instance to initialize some
         * of the attributes by information derived from a legacy stream type.
         * @param streamType one of {@link AudioManager#STREAM_VOICE_CALL},
         *   {@link AudioManager#STREAM_SYSTEM}, {@link AudioManager#STREAM_RING},
         *   {@link AudioManager#STREAM_MUSIC}, {@link AudioManager#STREAM_ALARM},
         *    or {@link AudioManager#STREAM_NOTIFICATION}.
         * @return the same Builder instance.
