     * Set the alpha level for this drawable [0..255]. Note that this drawable
     * also has a color in its paint, which has an alpha as well. These two
     * values are automatically combined during drawing. Thus if the color's
     * alpha is 75% (i.e. 192) and the drawable's alpha is 50% (i.e. 128), then
     * the combined alpha that will be used during drawing will be 37.5% (i.e.
     * 96).
