     * for a periodic sync, this call will remove any future occurrences.
     * <p>
     *     If a periodic sync is specified, the caller must hold the permission
     *     {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS}.

     * It is possible to cancel a sync using a SyncRequest object that is not the same object
     * with which you requested the sync. Do so by building a SyncRequest with the same
     * adapter, frequency, <b>and</b> extras bundle.
     *
     * @param request SyncRequest object containing information about sync to cancel.
