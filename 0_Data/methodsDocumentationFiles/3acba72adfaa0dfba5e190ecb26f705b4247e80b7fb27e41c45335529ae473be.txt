     * Parse the package at the given location. Automatically detects if the
     * package is a monolithic style (single APK file) or cluster style
     * (directory of APKs).
     * <p>
     * This performs sanity checking on cluster style packages, such as
     * requiring identical package name and version codes, a single base APK,
     * and unique split names.
     * <p>
     * Note that this <em>does not</em> perform signature verification; that
     * must be done separately in {@link #collectCertificates(Package, boolean)}.
     *
     * If {@code useCaches} is true, the package parser might return a cached
     * result from a previous parse of the same {@code packageFile} with the same
     * {@code flags}. Note that this method does not check whether {@code packageFile}
     * has changed since the last parse, it's up to callers to do so.
