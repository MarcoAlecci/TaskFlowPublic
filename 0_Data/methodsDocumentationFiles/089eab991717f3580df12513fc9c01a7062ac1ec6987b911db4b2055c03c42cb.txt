         * Sets the vsync time that represents the start point of this frame. Typically this
         * comes from {@link android.view.Choreographer.FrameCallback}. Other compatible time
         * sources include {@link System#nanoTime()}, however if the result is being displayed
         * on-screen then using {@link android.view.Choreographer} is strongly recommended to
         * ensure smooth animations.
         *
         * <p>If the clock source is not from a CLOCK_MONOTONIC source then any animations driven
         * directly by RenderThread will not be synchronized properly with the current frame.
         *
         * @param vsyncTime The vsync timestamp for this frame. The timestamp is in nanoseconds
         *                  and should come from a CLOCK_MONOTONIC source.
