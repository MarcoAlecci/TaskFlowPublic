     * Test whether the passed NetworkCapabilities satisfies the UIDs this capabilities require.
     *
     * This method is called on the NetworkCapabilities embedded in a request with the
     * capabilities of an available network. It checks whether all the UIDs from this listen
     * (representing the UIDs that must have access to the network) are satisfied by the UIDs
     * in the passed nc (representing the UIDs that this network is available to).
     * <p>
     * As a special exception, the UID that created the passed network (as represented by its
     * mOwnerUid field) always satisfies a NetworkRequest requiring it (of LISTEN
     * or REQUEST types alike), even if the network does not apply to it. That is so a VPN app
     * can see its own network when it listens for it.
     * <p>
     * nc is assumed nonnull. Else, NPE.
