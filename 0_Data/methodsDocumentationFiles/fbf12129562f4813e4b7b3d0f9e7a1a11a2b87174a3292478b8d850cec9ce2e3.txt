     * Returns the number of registered callbacks. Note that the number of registered
     * callbacks may differ from the value returned by {@link #beginBroadcast()} since
     * the former returns the number of callbacks registered at the time of the call
     * and the second the number of callback to which the broadcast will be delivered.
     * <p>
     * This function is useful to decide whether to schedule a broadcast if this
     * requires doing some work which otherwise would not be performed.
