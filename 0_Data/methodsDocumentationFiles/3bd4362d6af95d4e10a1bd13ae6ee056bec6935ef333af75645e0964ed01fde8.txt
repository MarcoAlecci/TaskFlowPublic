     * Creates a notification channel that notifications can be posted to.
     *
     * This can also be used to restore a deleted channel and to update an existing channel's
     * name, description, group, and/or importance.
     *
     * <p>The name and description should only be changed if the locale changes
     * or in response to the user renaming this channel. For example, if a user has a channel
     * named 'John Doe' that represents messages from a 'John Doe', and 'John Doe' changes his name
     * to 'John Smith,' the channel can be renamed to match.
     *
     * <p>The importance of an existing channel will only be changed if the new importance is lower
     * than the current value and the user has not altered any settings on this channel.
     *
     * <p>The group an existing channel will only be changed if the channel does not already
     * belong to a group.
     *
     * All other fields are ignored for channels that already exist.
     *
     * @param channel  the channel to create.  Note that the created channel may differ from this
     *                 value. If the provided channel is malformed, a RemoteException will be
     *                 thrown.
