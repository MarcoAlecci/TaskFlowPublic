     * Send the given key event code (as defined by {@link KeyEvent}) to the
     * current input connection is a key down + key up event pair.  The sent
     * events have {@link KeyEvent#FLAG_SOFT_KEYBOARD KeyEvent.FLAG_SOFT_KEYBOARD}
     * set, so that the recipient can identify them as coming from a software
     * input method, and
     * {@link KeyEvent#FLAG_KEEP_TOUCH_MODE KeyEvent.FLAG_KEEP_TOUCH_MODE}, so
     * that they don't impact the current touch mode of the UI.
     *
     * <p>Note that it's discouraged to send such key events in normal operation;
     * this is mainly for use with {@link android.text.InputType#TYPE_NULL} type
     * text fields, or for non-rich input methods. A reasonably capable software
     * input method should use the
     * {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection#commitText} family of methods
     * to send text to an application, rather than sending key events.</p>

     * @param keyEventCode The raw key code to send, as defined by
