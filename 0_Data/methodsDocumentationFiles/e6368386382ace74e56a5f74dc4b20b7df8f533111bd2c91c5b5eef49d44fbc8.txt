     * Gets the state of the meta keys for a specific key event.
     *
     * For input devices that use toggled key modifiers, the `toggled' state
     * is stored into the text buffer. This method retrieves the meta state
     * for this event, accounting for the stored state. If the event has been
     * created by a device that does not support toggled key modifiers, like
     * a virtual device for example, the stored state is ignored.
     *
     * @param text the buffer in which the meta key would have been pressed.
     * @param event the event for which to evaluate the meta state.
     * @return an integer in which each bit set to one represents a pressed
     *         or locked meta key.
