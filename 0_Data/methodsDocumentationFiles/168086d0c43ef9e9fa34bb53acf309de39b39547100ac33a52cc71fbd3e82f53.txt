     * Indicates whether network connectivity is possible. A network is unavailable
     * when a persistent or semi-persistent condition prevents the possibility
     * of connecting to that network. Examples include
     * <ul>
     * <li>The device is out of the coverage area for any network of this type.</li>
     * <li>The device is on a network other than the home network (i.e., roaming), and
     * data roaming has been disabled.</li>
     * <li>The device's radio is turned off, e.g., because airplane mode is enabled.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Since Android L, this always returns {@code true}, because the system only
     * returns info for available networks.
     * @return {@code true} if the network is available, {@code false} otherwise
     * @deprecated Apps should instead use the
     *             {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback} API to
     *             learn about connectivity changes.
     *             {@link ConnectivityManager#registerDefaultNetworkCallback} and
     *             {@link ConnectivityManager#registerNetworkCallback}. These will
     *             give a more accurate picture of the connectivity state of
     *             the device and let apps react more easily and quickly to changes.
