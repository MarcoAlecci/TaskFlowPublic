     * Given a start and stop distance, return in dst the intervening
     * segment(s). If the segment is zero-length, return false, else return
     * true. startD and stopD are pinned to legal values (0..getLength()).
     * If startD >= stopD then return false (and leave dst untouched).
     * Begin the segment with a moveTo if startWithMoveTo is true.
     *
     * <p>On {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT} and earlier
     * releases, the resulting path may not display on a hardware-accelerated
     * Canvas. A simple workaround is to add a single operation to this path,
     * such as <code>dst.rLineTo(0, 0)</code>.</p>
