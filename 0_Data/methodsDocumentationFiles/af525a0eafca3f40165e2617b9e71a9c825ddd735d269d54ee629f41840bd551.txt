     * Register a listener that will be notified whenever a child view is attached to or detached
     * from RecyclerView.
     *
     * <p>This listener will be called when a LayoutManager or the RecyclerView decides
     * that a child view is no longer needed. If an application associates expensive
     * or heavyweight data with item views, this may be a good place to release
     * or free those resources.</p>
