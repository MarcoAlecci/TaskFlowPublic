     * Returns a {@code Collector} which partitions the input elements according
     * to a {@code Predicate}, reduces the values in each partition according to
     * another {@code Collector}, and organizes them into a
     * {@code Map<Boolean, D>} whose values are the result of the downstream
     * reduction.
     *
     * <p>There are no guarantees on the type, mutability,
     * serializability, or thread-safety of the {@code Map} returned.
     *
     * @param <T> the type of the input elements
     * @param <A> the intermediate accumulation type of the downstream collector
     * @param <D> the result type of the downstream reduction
     * @param predicate a predicate used for classifying input elements
     * @param downstream a {@code Collector} implementing the downstream
     *                   reduction
     * @return a {@code Collector} implementing the cascaded partitioning
     *         operation
