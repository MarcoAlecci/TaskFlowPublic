     * Begins a transaction in IMMEDIATE mode. Transactions can be nested. When
     * the outer transaction is ended all of the work done in that transaction
     * and all of the nested transactions will be committed or rolled back. The
     * changes will be rolled back if any transaction is ended without being
     * marked as clean (by calling setTransactionSuccessful). Otherwise they
     * will be committed.
     * <p>
     * Here is the standard idiom for transactions:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   db.beginTransactionNonExclusive();
     *   try {
     *     ...
     *     db.setTransactionSuccessful();
     *   } finally {
     *     db.endTransaction();
     *   }
     * </pre>
