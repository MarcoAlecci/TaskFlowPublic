     * Unfortunately some developers (OpenFeint I am looking at you) have
     * compared the configChanges bit field against absolute values, so if we
     * introduce a new bit they break.  To deal with that, we will make sure
     * the public field will not have a value that breaks them, and let the
     * framework call here to get the real value.
