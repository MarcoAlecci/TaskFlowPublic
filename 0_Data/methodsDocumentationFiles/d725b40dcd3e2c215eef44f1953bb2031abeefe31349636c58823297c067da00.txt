         * <p>Copies the transform of this color space in specified array. The
         * transform is used to convert from RGB to XYZ (with the same white
         * point as this color space). To connect color spaces, you must first
         * {@link ColorSpace#adapt(ColorSpace, float[]) adapt} them to the
         * same white point.</p>
         * <p>It is recommended to use {@link ColorSpace#connect(ColorSpace, ColorSpace)}
         * to convert between color spaces.</p>
