         * Gets a classification score for the value of this field compared to the value of the
         * {@link UserData} entry.
         *
         * <p>The score is based in a comparison of the field value and the user data entry, and it
         * ranges from {@code 0.0F} to {@code 1.0F}:
         * <ul>
         *   <li>{@code 1.0F} represents a full match ({@code 100%}).
         *   <li>{@code 0.0F} represents a full mismatch ({@code 0%}).
         *   <li>Any other value is a partial match.
         * </ul>
         *
         * <p>How the score is calculated depends on the
         * {@link UserData.Builder#setFieldClassificationAlgorithm(String, android.os.Bundle)
         * algorithm} used.
