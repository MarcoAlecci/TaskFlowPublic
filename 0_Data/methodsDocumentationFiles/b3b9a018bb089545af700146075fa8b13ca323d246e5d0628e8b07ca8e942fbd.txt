     * Registers a ConnectivityDiagnosticsCallback with the System.
     *
     * <p>Only apps that offer network connectivity to the user should be registering callbacks.
     * These are the only apps whose callbacks will be invoked by the system. Apps considered to
     * meet these conditions include:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Carrier apps with active subscriptions
     *   <li>Active VPNs
     *   <li>WiFi Suggesters
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Callbacks registered by apps not meeting the above criteria will not be invoked.
     *
     * <p>If a registering app loses its relevant permissions, any callbacks it registered will
     * silently stop receiving callbacks.
     *
     * <p>Each register() call <b>MUST</b> use a ConnectivityDiagnosticsCallback instance that is
     * not currently registered. If a ConnectivityDiagnosticsCallback instance is registered with
     * multiple NetworkRequests, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
     *
     * <p>To avoid performance issues due to apps leaking callbacks, the system will limit the
     * number of outstanding requests to 100 per app (identified by their UID), shared with
     * callbacks in {@link ConnectivityManager}. Registering a callback with this method will count
     * toward this limit. If this limit is exceeded, an exception will be thrown. To avoid hitting
     * this issue and to conserve resources, make sure to unregister the callbacks with
     * {@link #unregisterConnectivityDiagnosticsCallback}.
     *
     * @param request The NetworkRequest that will be used to match with Networks for which
     *     callbacks will be fired
     * @param e The Executor to be used for running the callback method invocations
     * @param callback The ConnectivityDiagnosticsCallback that the caller wants registered with the
     *     System
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the same callback instance is registered with multiple
     *     NetworkRequests
     * @throws RuntimeException if the app already has too many callbacks registered.
