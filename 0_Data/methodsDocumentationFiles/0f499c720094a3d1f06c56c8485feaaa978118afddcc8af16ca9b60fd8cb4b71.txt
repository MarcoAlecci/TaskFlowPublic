         * @param isAuxiliary should true when this subtype is auxiliary, false otherwise.
         * An auxiliary subtype has the following differences with a regular subtype:
         * - An auxiliary subtype cannot be chosen as the default IME in Settings.
         * - The framework will never switch to this subtype through
         *   {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager#switchToLastInputMethod}.
         * Note that the subtype will still be available in the IME switcher.
         * The intent is to allow for IMEs to specify they are meant to be invoked temporarily
         * in a one-shot way, and to return to the previous IME once finished (e.g. voice input).
