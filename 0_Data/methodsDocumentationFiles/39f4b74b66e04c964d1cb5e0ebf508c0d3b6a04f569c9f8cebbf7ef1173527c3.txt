     * Return a list of the tasks that are currently running, with
     * the most recent being first and older ones after in order.  Note that
     * "running" does not mean any of the task's code is currently loaded or
     * activity -- the task may have been frozen by the system, so that it
     * can be restarted in its previous state when next brought to the
     * foreground.
     *
     * <p><b>Note: this method is only intended for debugging and presenting
     * task management user interfaces</b>.  This should never be used for
     * core logic in an application, such as deciding between different
     * behaviors based on the information found here.  Such uses are
     * <em>not</em> supported, and will likely break in the future.  For
     * example, if multiple applications can be actively running at the
     * same time, assumptions made about the meaning of the data here for
     * purposes of control flow will be incorrect.</p>

     * @deprecated As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP}, this method
     * is no longer available to third party
     * applications: the introduction of document-centric recents means
     * it can leak person information to the caller.  For backwards compatibility,
     * it will still return a small subset of its data: at least the caller's
     * own tasks, and possibly some other tasks
     * such as home that are known to not be sensitive.
     *
     * @param maxNum The maximum number of entries to return in the list.  The
     * actual number returned may be smaller, depending on how many tasks the
     * user has started.
     *
     * @return Returns a list of RunningTaskInfo records describing each of
     * the running tasks.
