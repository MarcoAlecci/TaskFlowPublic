     * Visually distinct portion of a window with window-like semantics are considered panes for
     * accessibility purposes. One example is the content view of a fragment that is replaced.
     * In order for accessibility services to understand a pane's window-like behavior, panes
     * should have descriptive titles. Views with pane titles produce {@link AccessibilityEvent}s
     * when they appear, disappear, or change title.
     *
     * @param accessibilityPaneTitle The pane's title. Setting to {@code null} indicates that this
     *                               View is not a pane.
