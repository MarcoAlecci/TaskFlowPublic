     * Causes the Runnable r to be added to the message queue, to be run
     * at a specific time given by <var>uptimeMillis</var>.
     * <b>The time-base is {@link android.os.SystemClock#uptimeMillis}.</b>
     * Time spent in deep sleep will add an additional delay to execution.
     * The runnable will be run on the thread to which this handler is attached.
     *
     * @param r The Runnable that will be executed.
     * @param token An instance which can be used to cancel {@code r} via
     *         {@link #removeCallbacksAndMessages}.
     * @param uptimeMillis The absolute time at which the callback should run,
     *         using the {@link android.os.SystemClock#uptimeMillis} time-base.
     * 
     * @return Returns true if the Runnable was successfully placed in to the 
     *         message queue.  Returns false on failure, usually because the
     *         looper processing the message queue is exiting.  Note that a
     *         result of true does not mean the Runnable will be processed -- if
     *         the looper is quit before the delivery time of the message
     *         occurs then the message will be dropped.
