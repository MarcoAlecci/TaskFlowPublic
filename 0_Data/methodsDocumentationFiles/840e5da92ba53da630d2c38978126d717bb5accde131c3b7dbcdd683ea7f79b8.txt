     * Called when the {@link RouteDiscoveryPreference discovery preference} has changed.
     * <p>
     * Whenever an application registers a {@link MediaRouter2.RouteCallback callback},
     * it also provides a discovery preference to specify features of routes that it is interested
     * in. The media router combines all of these discovery request into a single discovery
     * preference and notifies each provider.
     * </p><p>
     * The provider should examine {@link RouteDiscoveryPreference#getPreferredFeatures()
     * preferred features} in the discovery preference to determine what kind of routes it should
     * try to discover and whether it should perform active or passive scans. In many cases,
     * the provider may be able to save power by not performing any scans when the request doesn't
     * have any matching route features.
     * </p>

     * @param preference the new discovery preference
