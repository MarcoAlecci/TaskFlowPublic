     * Set the matrix such that the specified src points would map to the specified dst points. The
     * "points" are represented as an array of floats, order [x0, y0, x1, y1, ...], where each
     * "point" is 2 float values.
     *
     * @param src The array of src [x,y] pairs (points)
     * @param srcIndex Index of the first pair of src values
     * @param dst The array of dst [x,y] pairs (points)
     * @param dstIndex Index of the first pair of dst values
     * @param pointCount The number of pairs/points to be used. Must be [0..4]
     * @return true if the matrix was set to the specified transformation
