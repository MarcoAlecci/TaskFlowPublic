         * sessions can continue to play during the preparation of this session. This method can be
         * used to speed up the start of the playback. Once the preparation is done, the session
         * will change its playback state to {@link PlaybackState#STATE_PAUSED}. Afterwards,
         * {@link #play} can be called to start playback. If the preparation is not needed,
         * {@link #playFromMediaId} can be directly called without this method.
