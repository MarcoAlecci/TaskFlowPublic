     * Called when assist structure is being retrieved from a view as part of
     * {@link android.app.Activity#onProvideAssistData Activity.onProvideAssistData} to
     * generate additional virtual structure under this view.  The defaullt implementation
     * uses {@link #getAccessibilityNodeProvider()} to try to generate this from the
     * view's virtual accessibility nodes, if any.  You can override this for a more
     * optimal implementation providing this data.
