     * Inset the rectangle by (dx,dy). If dx is positive, then the sides are
     * moved inwards, making the rectangle narrower. If dx is negative, then the
     * sides are moved outwards, making the rectangle wider. The same holds true
     * for dy and the top and bottom.
     *
     * @param dx The amount to add(subtract) from the rectangle's left(right)
     * @param dy The amount to add(subtract) from the rectangle's top(bottom)
