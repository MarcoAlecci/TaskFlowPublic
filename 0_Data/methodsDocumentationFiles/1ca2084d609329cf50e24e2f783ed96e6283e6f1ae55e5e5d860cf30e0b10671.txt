     * <p>Applications must only send the INF payload, and not the start of frame and
     * end of frame indicators. Applications do not need to fragment the payload, it
     * will be automatically fragmented and defragmented by {@link #transceive} if
     * it exceeds FSD/FSC limits.
     *
     * <p>Use {@link #getMaxTransceiveLength} to retrieve the maximum number of bytes
     * that can be sent with {@link #transceive}.
     *
     * <p>This is an I/O operation and will block until complete. It must
     * not be called from the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
     * {@link IOException} if {@link #close} is called from another thread.
     *

     * @param data command bytes to send, must not be null
     * @return response bytes received, will not be null
     * @throws TagLostException if the tag leaves the field
     * @throws IOException if there is an I/O failure, or this operation is canceled
