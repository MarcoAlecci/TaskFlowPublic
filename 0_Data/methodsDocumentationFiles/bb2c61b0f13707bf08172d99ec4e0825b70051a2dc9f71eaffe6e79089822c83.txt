     * Low-level function for instantiating a view by name. This attempts to
     * instantiate a view class of the given <var>name</var> found in this
     * LayoutInflater's ClassLoader. To use an explicit Context in the View
     * constructor, use {@link #createView(Context, String, String, AttributeSet)} instead.
     *
     * <p>
     * There are two things that can happen in an error case: either the
     * exception describing the error will be thrown, or a null will be
     * returned. You must deal with both possibilities -- the former will happen
     * the first time createView() is called for a class of a particular name,
     * the latter every time there-after for that class name.
     *
     * @param name The full name of the class to be instantiated.
     * @param attrs The XML attributes supplied for this instance.
     *
     * @return View The newly instantiated view, or null.
