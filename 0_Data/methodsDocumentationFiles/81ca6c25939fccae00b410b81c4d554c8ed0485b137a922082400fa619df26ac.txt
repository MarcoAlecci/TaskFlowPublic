     * Compares this buffer to another.
     *
     * <p> Two float buffers are compared by comparing their sequences of
     * remaining elements lexicographically, without regard to the starting
     * position of each sequence within its corresponding buffer.

     * Pairs of {@code float} elements are compared as if by invoking
     * {@link Float#compare(float,float)}, except that
     * {@code -0.0} and {@code 0.0} are considered to be equal.
     * {@code Float.NaN} is considered by this method to be equal
     * to itself and greater than all other {@code float} values
     * (including {@code Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY}).
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * <p> A float buffer is not comparable to any other type of object.
     *
     * @return  A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this buffer
     *          is less than, equal to, or greater than the given buffer
