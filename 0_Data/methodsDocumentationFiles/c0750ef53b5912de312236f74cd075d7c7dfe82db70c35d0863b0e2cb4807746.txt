     * Returns a {@link android.util.Pair} list for channel mapping, which indicating how this
     * microphone is used by each channels or a capture stream. For each {@link android.util.Pair},
     * the first value is channel index, the second value is channel mapping type, which could be
     * either {@link #CHANNEL_MAPPING_DIRECT} or {@link #CHANNEL_MAPPING_PROCESSED}.
     * If a channel has contributions from more than one microphone, it is likely the HAL

     * At least one entry when the MicrophoneInfo is returned by AudioRecord.getActiveMicrophones().
