     * Returns the current pressure of this event for the given pointer
     * <em>index</em> (use {@link #getPointerId(int)} to find the pointer
     * identifier for this index).
     * The pressure generally
     * ranges from 0 (no pressure at all) to 1 (normal pressure), however
     * values higher than 1 may be generated depending on the calibration of
     * the input device.
     * @param pointerIndex Raw index of pointer to retrieve.  Value may be from 0
     * (the first pointer that is down) to {@link #getPointerCount()}-1.
