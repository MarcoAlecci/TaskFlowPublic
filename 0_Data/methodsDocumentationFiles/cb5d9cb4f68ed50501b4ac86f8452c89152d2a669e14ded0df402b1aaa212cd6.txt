         * TODO(chiuwinson): This is required because PackageManager#getPackageArchiveInfo
         *   cannot read the targetSdk info from the changeId because it requires the
         *   READ_COMPAT_CHANGE_CONFIG which cannot be obtained automatically without entering the
         *   server process. This should be removed once an alternative is found, or if the API
         *   is removed.
         * @return the targetSdk that this change is gated on (> check), or -1 if disabled
