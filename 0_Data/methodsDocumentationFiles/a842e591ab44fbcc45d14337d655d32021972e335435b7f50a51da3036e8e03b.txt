     * This function checks if the device has implemented Sustained Performance
     * Mode. This needs to be checked only once and is constant for a particular
     * device/release.
     *
     * Sustained Performance Mode is intended to provide a consistent level of
     * performance for prolonged amount of time.
     *
     * Applications should check if the device supports this mode, before using
     * {@link android.view.Window#setSustainedPerformanceMode}.
     *
     * @return Returns True if the device supports it, false otherwise.
