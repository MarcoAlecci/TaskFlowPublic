     * Install a VpnProfile configuration keyed on the calling app's package name.
     *
     * <p>This method returns {@code null} if user consent has already been granted, or an {@link
     * Intent} to a system activity. If an intent is returned, the application should launch the
     * activity using {@link Activity#startActivityForResult} to request user consent. The activity
     * may pop up a dialog to require user action, and the result will come back via its {@link
     * Activity#onActivityResult}. If the result is {@link Activity#RESULT_OK}, the user has
     * consented, and the VPN profile can be started.
     *
     * @param profile the VpnProfile provided by this package. Will override any previous VpnProfile
     *     stored for this package.
     * @return an Intent requesting user consent to start the VPN, or null if consent is not
     *     required based on privileges or previous user consent.
