     * Return the bounds of the current clip (in local coordinates) in the
     * bounds parameter, and return true if it is non-empty. This can be useful
     * in a way similar to quickReject, in that it tells you that drawing
     * outside of these bounds will be clipped out.
     *
     * @param bounds Return the clip bounds here. If it is null, ignore it but
     *               still return true if the current clip is non-empty.
     * @return true if the current clip is non-empty.
