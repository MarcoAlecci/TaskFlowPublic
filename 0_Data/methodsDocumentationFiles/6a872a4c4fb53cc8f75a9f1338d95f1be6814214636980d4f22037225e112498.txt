     * Called by any app to display a support dialog when a feature was disabled by an admin.
     * This returns an intent that can be used with {@link Context#startActivity(Intent)} to
     * display the dialog. It will tell the user that the feature indicated by {@code restriction}
     * was disabled by an admin, and include a link for more information. The default content of
     * the dialog can be changed by the restricting admin via
     * {@link #setShortSupportMessage(ComponentName, CharSequence)}. If the restriction is not
     * set (i.e. the feature is available), then the return value will be {@code null}.
     * @param restriction Indicates for which feature the dialog should be displayed. Can be a
     *            user restriction from {@link UserManager}, e.g.
     *            {@link UserManager#DISALLOW_ADJUST_VOLUME}, or one of the constants
     *            {@link #POLICY_DISABLE_CAMERA} or {@link #POLICY_DISABLE_SCREEN_CAPTURE}.
     * @return Intent An intent to be used to start the dialog-activity if the restriction is
     *            set by an admin, or null if the restriction does not exist or no admin set it.
