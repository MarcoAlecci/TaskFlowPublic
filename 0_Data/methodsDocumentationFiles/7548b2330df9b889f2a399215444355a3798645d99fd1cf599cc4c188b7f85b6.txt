     * <p>Finalize the output configurations that now have their deferred and/or extra Surfaces
     * included.</p>
     *
     * <p>For camera use cases where a preview and other output configurations need to be
     * configured, it can take some time for the preview Surface to be ready. For example, if the
     * preview Surface is obtained from {@link android.view.SurfaceView}, the SurfaceView will only
     * be ready after the UI layout is done, potentially delaying camera startup.</p>
     *
     * <p>To speed up camera startup time, the application can configure the
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession} with the eventual preview size (via
     * {@link OutputConfiguration#OutputConfiguration(Size,Class) a deferred OutputConfiguration}),
     * and defer the preview output configuration until the Surface is ready. After the
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession} is created successfully with this deferred output and other
     * normal outputs, the application can start submitting requests as long as they do not include
     * deferred output Surfaces. Once a deferred Surface is ready, the application can add the
     * Surface to the deferred output configuration with the
     * {@link OutputConfiguration#addSurface} method, and then update the deferred output
     * configuration via this method, before it can submit capture requests with this output
     * target.</p>
     *
     * <p>This function can also be called in case where multiple surfaces share the same
     * OutputConfiguration, and one of the surfaces becomes available after the {@link
     * CameraCaptureSession} is created. In that case, the application must first create the
     * OutputConfiguration with the available Surface, then enable further surface sharing via
     * {@link OutputConfiguration#enableSurfaceSharing}, before creating the CameraCaptureSession.
     * After the CameraCaptureSession is created, and once the extra Surface becomes available, the
     * application must then call {@link OutputConfiguration#addSurface} before finalizing the
     * configuration with this method.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the provided OutputConfigurations are unchanged from session creation, this function
     * call has no effect. This function must only be called once for a particular output
     * configuration. </p>
     *
     * <p>The output Surfaces included by this list of
     * {@link OutputConfiguration OutputConfigurations} can be used as {@link CaptureRequest}
     * targets as soon as this call returns.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method is not supported by
     * {@link CameraCharacteristics#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL_LEGACY LEGACY}-level devices.</p>

     * @throws IllegalArgumentException for invalid output configurations, including ones where the
