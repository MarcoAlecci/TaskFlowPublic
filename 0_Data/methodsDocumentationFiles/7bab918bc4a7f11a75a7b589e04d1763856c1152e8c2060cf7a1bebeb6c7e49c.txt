     * Control whether the shown Dialog is cancelable.  Use this instead of
     * directly calling {@link Dialog#setCancelable(boolean)
     * Dialog.setCancelable(boolean)}, because DialogFragment needs to change
     * its behavior based on this.
     *
     * @param cancelable If true, the dialog is cancelable.  The default
     * is true.
