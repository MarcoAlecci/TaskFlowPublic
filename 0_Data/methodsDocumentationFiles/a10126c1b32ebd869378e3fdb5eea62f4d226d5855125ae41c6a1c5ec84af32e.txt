     * Tells whether or not the given byte array is a legal replacement value
     * for this encoder.
     *
     * <p> A replacement is legal if, and only if, it is a legal sequence of
     * bytes in this encoder's charset; that is, it must be possible to decode
     * the replacement into one or more sixteen-bit Unicode characters.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method is not very efficient; it
     * should generally be overridden to improve performance.  </p>

     * @param  repl  The byte array to be tested

     * @return  <tt>true</tt> if, and only if, the given byte array
     *          is a legal replacement value for this encoder
