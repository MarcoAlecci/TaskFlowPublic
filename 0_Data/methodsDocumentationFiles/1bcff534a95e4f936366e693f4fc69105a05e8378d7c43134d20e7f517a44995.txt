     * Specify the level for the drawable.  This allows a drawable to vary its
     * imagery based on a continuous controller, for example to show progress
     * or volume level.
     *
     * <p>If the new level you are supplying causes the appearance of the
     * Drawable to change, then it is responsible for calling
     * {@link #invalidateSelf} in order to have itself redrawn, <em>and</em>
     * true will be returned from this function.
     *
     * @param level The new level, from 0 (minimum) to 10000 (maximum).
     *
     * @return Returns true if this change in level has caused the appearance
     * of the Drawable to change (hence requiring an invalidate), otherwise
     * returns false.
