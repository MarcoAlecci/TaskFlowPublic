         * Sets whether a test of user presence is required to be performed between the
         * {@code Signature.initSign()} and {@code Signature.sign()} method calls.
         * It requires that the KeyStore implementation have a direct way to validate the user
         * presence for example a KeyStore hardware backed strongbox can use a button press that
         * is observable in hardware. A test for user presence is tangential to authentication. The
         * test can be part of an authentication step as long as this step can be validated by the
         * hardware protecting the key and cannot be spoofed. For example, a physical button press
         * can be used as a test of user presence if the other pins connected to the button are not
         * able to simulate a button press.There must be no way for the primary processor to fake a
         * button press, or that button must not be used as a test of user presence.
