     * Callback invoked when the current emergency number list has changed on the registered
     * subscription.
     * Note, the registration subId comes from {@link TelephonyManager} object which registers
     * PhoneStateListener by {@link TelephonyManager#listen(PhoneStateListener, int)}.
     * If this TelephonyManager object was created with
     * {@link TelephonyManager#createForSubscriptionId(int)}, then the callback applies to the
     * subId. Otherwise, this callback applies to
     * {@link SubscriptionManager#getDefaultSubscriptionId()}.
     *
     * @param emergencyNumberList Map including the key as the active subscription ID
     *                           (Note: if there is no active subscription, the key is
     *                           {@link SubscriptionManager#getDefaultSubscriptionId})
     *                           and the value as the list of {@link EmergencyNumber};
