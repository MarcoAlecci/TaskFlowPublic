     * Set the animated values for this object to this set of Objects.
     * If there is only one value, it is assumed to be the end value of an animation,
     * and an initial value will be derived, if possible, by calling a getter function
     * on the object. Also, if any value is null, the value will be filled in when the animation
     * starts in the same way. This mechanism of automatically getting null values only works
     * if the PropertyValuesHolder object is used in conjunction
     * {@link ObjectAnimator}, and with a getter function
     * derived automatically from <code>propertyName</code>, since otherwise PropertyValuesHolder has
     * no way of determining what the value should be.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Object values are stored as references to the original
     * objects, which means that changes to those objects after this method is called will
     * affect the values on the PropertyValuesHolder. If the objects will be mutated externally
     * after this method is called, callers should pass a copy of those objects instead.
     *
     * @param values One or more values that the animation will animate between.
