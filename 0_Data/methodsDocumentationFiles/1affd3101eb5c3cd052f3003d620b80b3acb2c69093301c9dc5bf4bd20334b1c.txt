         * Adds a layout rule to be interpreted by the RelativeLayout.
         * <p>
         * This method should only be used for verbs that don't refer to a
         * sibling (ex. {@link #ALIGN_RIGHT}) or take a boolean
         * value ({@link #TRUE} for true or 0 for false). To
         * specify a verb that takes a subject, use {@link #addRule(int, int)}.
         * <p>
         * If the rule is relative to the layout direction (ex.
         * {@link #ALIGN_PARENT_START}), then the layout direction must be
         * resolved using {@link #resolveLayoutDirection(int)} before calling
         * {@link #getRule(int)} an absolute rule (ex.
         * {@link #ALIGN_PARENT_LEFT}.
         *
         * @param verb a layout verb, such as {@link #ALIGN_PARENT_LEFT}
         * @see #addRule(int, int)
         * @see #removeRule(int)
         * @see #getRule(int)
