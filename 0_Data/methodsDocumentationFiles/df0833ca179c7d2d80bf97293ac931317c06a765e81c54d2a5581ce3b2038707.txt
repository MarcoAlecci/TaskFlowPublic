     * Postpone the entering activity transition when Activity was started with
     * {@link android.app.ActivityOptions#makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity,
     * android.util.Pair[])}.
     * <p>This method gives the Activity the ability to delay starting the entering and
     * shared element transitions until all data is loaded. Until then, the Activity won't
     * draw into its window, leaving the window transparent. This may also cause the
     * returning animation to be delayed until data is ready. This method should be
     * called in {@link #onCreate(android.os.Bundle)} or in
     * {@link #onActivityReenter(int, android.content.Intent)}.
     * {@link #startPostponedEnterTransition()} must be called to allow the Activity to
     * start the transitions. If the Activity did not use
     * {@link android.app.ActivityOptions#makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity,
     * android.util.Pair[])}, then this method does nothing.</p>
