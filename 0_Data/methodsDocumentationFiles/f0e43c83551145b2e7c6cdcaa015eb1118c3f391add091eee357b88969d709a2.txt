     * Reads into an array of bytes.  This method will block until some input
     * is available. Consider using java.io.DataInputStream.readFully to read
     * exactly 'length' bytes.
     *
     * @param   buf the buffer into which the data is read
     * @param   off the start offset of the data
     * @param   len the maximum number of bytes read
     * @return  the actual number of bytes read, -1 is returned when the end of
     *          the stream is reached.
     * @throws  IOException If an I/O error has occurred.
     * @see java.io.DataInputStream#readFully(byte[],int,int)
