     * Create a waveform vibration.
     *
     * Waveform vibrations are a potentially repeating series of timing and amplitude pairs. For
     * each pair, the value in the amplitude array determines the strength of the vibration and the
     * value in the timing array determines how long it vibrates for. An amplitude of 0 implies no
     * vibration (i.e. off), and any pairs with a timing value of 0 will be ignored.
     * <p>
     * The amplitude array of the generated waveform will be the same size as the given
     * timing array with alternating values of 0 (i.e. off) and {@link #DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE},
     * starting with 0. Therefore the first timing value will be the period to wait before turning
     * the vibrator on, the second value will be how long to vibrate at {@link #DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE}
     * strength, etc.
     * </p><p>
     * To cause the pattern to repeat, pass the index into the timings array at which to start the
     * repetition, or -1 to disable repeating.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param timings The pattern of alternating on-off timings, starting with off. Timing values
     *                of 0 will cause the timing / amplitude pair to be ignored.
     * @param repeat The index into the timings array at which to repeat, or -1 if you you don't
     *               want to repeat.
     *
     * @return The desired effect.
