     * <p>A privileged client can inject a {@link Location} if it has a better estimate of what
     * the recent location is.  This is especially useful when the device boots up and the GPS
     * chipset is in the process of getting the first fix.  If the client has cached the location,
     * it can inject the {@link Location}, so if an app requests for a {@link Location} from {@link
     * #getLastKnownLocation(String)}, the location information is still useful before getting
     * the first fix.
     *
     * @param location newly available {@link Location} object

     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if location is null
