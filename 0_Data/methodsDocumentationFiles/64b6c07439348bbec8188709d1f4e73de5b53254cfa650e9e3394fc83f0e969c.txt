     * Test that two interfaces are equal. This is the Java equivalent to C++
     * interfacesEqual function.
     * This essentially calls .equals on the internal binder objects (via Binder()).
     * - If both interfaces are proxies, asBinder() returns a {@link HwRemoteBinder}
     *   object, and they are compared in {@link HwRemoteBinder#equals}.
     * - If both interfaces are stubs, asBinder() returns the object itself. By default,
     *   auto-generated IFoo.Stub does not override equals(), but an implementation can
     *   optionally override it, and {@code interfacesEqual} will use it here.
