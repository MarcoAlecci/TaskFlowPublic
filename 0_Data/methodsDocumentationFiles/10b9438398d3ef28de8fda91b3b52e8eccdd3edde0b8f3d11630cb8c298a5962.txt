     * Reload all persisted rollback data from device storage.
     * This API is meant to test that rollback state is properly preserved
     * across device reboot, by simulating what happens on reboot without
     * actually rebooting the device.
     *
     * Note rollbacks in the process of enabling will be lost after calling
     * this method since they are not persisted yet. Don't call this method
     * in the middle of the install process.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller does not have appropriate permissions.
