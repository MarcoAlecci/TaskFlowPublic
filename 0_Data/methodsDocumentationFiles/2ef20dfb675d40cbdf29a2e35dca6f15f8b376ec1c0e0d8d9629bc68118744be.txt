     * Create an SmsMessage from a raw PDU. Guess format based on Voice
     * technology first, if it fails use other format.
     * All applications which handle
     * incoming SMS messages by processing the {@code SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION} broadcast
     * intent <b>must</b> now pass the new {@code format} String extra from the intent
     * into the new method {@code createFromPdu(byte[], String)} which takes an
     * extra format parameter. This is required in order to correctly decode the PDU on
     * devices that require support for both 3GPP and 3GPP2 formats at the same time,
     * such as dual-mode GSM/CDMA and CDMA/LTE phones.
     * @deprecated Use {@link #createFromPdu(byte[], String)} instead.
