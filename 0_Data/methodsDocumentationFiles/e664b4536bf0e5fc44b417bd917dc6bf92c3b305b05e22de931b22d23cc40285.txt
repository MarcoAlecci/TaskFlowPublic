         * Specify that to run this job, the device must be charging (or be a
         * non-battery-powered device connected to permanent power, such as Android TV
         * devices). This defaults to {@code false}.
         *
         * <p class="note">For purposes of running jobs, a battery-powered device
         * "charging" is not quite the same as simply being connected to power.  If the
         * device is so busy that the battery is draining despite a power connection, jobs
         * with this constraint will <em>not</em> run.  This can happen during some
         * common use cases such as video chat, particularly if the device is plugged in
         * to USB rather than to wall power.
         *
         * @param requiresCharging Pass {@code true} to require that the device be
         *     charging in order to run the job.
