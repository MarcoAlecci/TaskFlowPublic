     * <p>The callbacks will continue to be called as long as the process is live or
     * {@link #unregisterUsageCallback} is called.
     *
     * @param networkType Type of network to monitor. Either
                  {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_MOBILE} or {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_WIFI}.
     * @param subscriberId If applicable, the subscriber id of the network interface.
     *                     <p>Starting with API level 29, the {@code subscriberId} is guarded by
     *                     additional restrictions. Calling apps that do not meet the new
     *                     requirements to access the {@code subscriberId} can provide a {@code
     *                     null} value when registering for the mobile network type to receive
     *                     notifications for all mobile networks. For additional details see {@link
     *                     TelephonyManager#getSubscriberId()}.
     * @param thresholdBytes Threshold in bytes to be notified on.
     * @param callback The {@link UsageCallback} that the system will call when data usage
     *            has exceeded the specified threshold.
     * @param handler to dispatch callback events through, otherwise if {@code null} it uses
     *            the calling thread.
