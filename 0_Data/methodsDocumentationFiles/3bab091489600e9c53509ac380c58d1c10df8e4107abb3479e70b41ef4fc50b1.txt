     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZonedDateTime} strictly validating the
     * combination of local date-time, offset and zone ID.
     * <p>
     * This creates a zoned date-time ensuring that the offset is valid for the
     * local date-time according to the rules of the specified zone.
     * If the offset is invalid, an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @param localDateTime  the local date-time, not null
     * @param offset  the zone offset, not null
     * @param zone  the time-zone, not null
     * @return the zoned date-time, not null
