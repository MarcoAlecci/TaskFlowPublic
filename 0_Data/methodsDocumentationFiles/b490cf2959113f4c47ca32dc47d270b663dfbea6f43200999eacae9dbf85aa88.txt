     * Called by a device owner to bind to a service from a secondary managed user or vice versa.
     * See {@link #getBindDeviceAdminTargetUsers} for the pre-requirements of a
     * device owner to bind to services of another managed user.
     * <p>
     * The service must be protected by {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN}.
     * Note that the {@link Context} used to obtain this
     * {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance via {@link Context#getSystemService(Class)} will be used
     * to bind to the {@link android.app.Service}.
     * <p>
     * Note: This method used to be available for communication between device owner and profile
     * owner. However, since Android 11, this combination is not possible. This method is now
     * only useful for communication between device owner and managed secondary users.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param serviceIntent Identifies the service to connect to.  The Intent must specify either an
     *        explicit component name or a package name to match an
     *        {@link IntentFilter} published by a service.
     * @param conn Receives information as the service is started and stopped in main thread. This
     *        must be a valid {@link ServiceConnection} object; it must not be {@code null}.
     * @param flags Operation options for the binding operation. See
     *        {@link Context#bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)}.
     * @param targetUser Which user to bind to. Must be one of the users returned by
     *        {@link #getBindDeviceAdminTargetUsers}, otherwise a {@link SecurityException} will
     *        be thrown.
     * @return If you have successfully bound to the service, {@code true} is returned;
     *         {@code false} is returned if the connection is not made and you will not
     *         receive the service object.
