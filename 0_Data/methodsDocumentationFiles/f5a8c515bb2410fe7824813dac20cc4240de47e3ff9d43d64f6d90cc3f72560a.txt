     * Returns the rotation of the screen from its "natural" orientation.
     * The returned value may be {@link Surface#ROTATION_0 Surface.ROTATION_0}
     * (no rotation), {@link Surface#ROTATION_90 Surface.ROTATION_90},
     * {@link Surface#ROTATION_180 Surface.ROTATION_180}, or
     * {@link Surface#ROTATION_270 Surface.ROTATION_270}.  For
     * example, if a device has a naturally tall screen, and the user has
     * turned it on its side to go into a landscape orientation, the value
     * returned here may be either {@link Surface#ROTATION_90 Surface.ROTATION_90}
     * or {@link Surface#ROTATION_270 Surface.ROTATION_270} depending on
     * the direction it was turned.  The angle is the rotation of the drawn
     * graphics on the screen, which is the opposite direction of the physical
     * rotation of the device.  For example, if the device is rotated 90
     * degrees counter-clockwise, to compensate rendering will be rotated by
     * 90 degrees clockwise and thus the returned value here will be
     * {@link Surface#ROTATION_90 Surface.ROTATION_90}.
