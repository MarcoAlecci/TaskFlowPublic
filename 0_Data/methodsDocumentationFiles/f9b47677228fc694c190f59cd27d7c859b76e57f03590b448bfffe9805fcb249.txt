     * As of API level 23, the {@link #getHighResolutionOutputSizes} method can be used on devices
     * that support the
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_BURST_CAPTURE BURST_CAPTURE}
     * capability to get a list of high-resolution output sizes that cannot operate at the preferred
     * 20fps rate. This means that for some supported formats, this method will return an empty
     * list, if all the supported resolutions operate at below 20fps.  For devices that do not
     * support the BURST_CAPTURE capability, all output resolutions are listed through this method.
