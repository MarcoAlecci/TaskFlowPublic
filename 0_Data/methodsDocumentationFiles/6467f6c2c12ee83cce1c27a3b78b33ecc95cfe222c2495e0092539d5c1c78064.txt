         * Sets the current session as the main session. The main session is a session whose
         * corresponding TV input determines the HDMI-CEC active source device.

         * <p>TV input service that manages HDMI-CEC logical device should implement {@link
         * #onSetMain} to (1) select the corresponding HDMI logical device as the source device
         * when {@code isMain} is {@code true}, and to (2) select the internal device (= TV itself)
         * as the source device when {@code isMain} is {@code false} and the session is still main.
         * Also, if a surface is passed to a non-main session and active source is changed to
         * initiate the surface, the active source should be returned to the main session.
         *
         * <p>{@link TvView} guarantees that, when tuning involves a session transition, {@code
         * onSetMain(true)} for new session is called first, {@code onSetMain(false)} for old
         * session is called afterwards. This allows {@code onSetMain(false)} to be no-op when TV
         * input service knows that the next main session corresponds to another HDMI logical
         * device. Practically, this implies that one TV input service should handle all HDMI port
         * and HDMI-CEC logical devices for smooth active source transition.

         * @param isMain If true, session should become main.
