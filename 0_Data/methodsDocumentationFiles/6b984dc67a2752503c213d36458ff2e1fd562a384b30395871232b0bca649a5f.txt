     * Non-static convenience version of disableSystemWide() for situations in which only a
     * single PropertyInvalidatedCache is keyed on a particular property value.
     *
     * When multiple caches share a single property value, using an instance method on one of
     * the cache objects to invalidate all of the cache objects becomes confusing and you should
     * just use the static version of this function.
