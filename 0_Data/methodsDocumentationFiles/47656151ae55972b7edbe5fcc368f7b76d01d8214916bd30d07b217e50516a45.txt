     * In Activity Transitions, onSharedElementEnd is called immediately before
     * capturing the end of the shared element state on enter and reenter transitions and
     * immediately before capturing the start of the shared element state for exit and return
     * transitions.
     * <p>
     * In Fragment Transitions, onSharedElementEnd is called immediately before capturing the
     * end state of all shared element transitions.
     * <p>
     * This call can be used to adjust the transition end state by modifying the shared
     * element Views. Note that no layout step will be executed between onSharedElementEnd
     * and the transition state capture.
     * <p>
     * Any changes made in {@link #onSharedElementStart(List, List, List)} that are not updated
     * during layout should be corrected in onSharedElementEnd. For example, rotation or scale
     * will not be affected by layout and if changed in
     * {@link #onSharedElementStart(List, List, List)}, it will also have to be reset in
     * onSharedElementEnd again to correct the end state.
     *
     * @param sharedElementNames The names of the shared elements that were accepted into
     *                           the View hierarchy.
     * @param sharedElements The shared elements that are part of the View hierarchy.
     * @param sharedElementSnapshots The Views containing snap shots of the shared element
     *                               from the launching Window. These elements will not
     *                               be part of the scene, but will be positioned relative
     *                               to the Window decor View. This list will be null for
     *                               Fragment Transitions.
