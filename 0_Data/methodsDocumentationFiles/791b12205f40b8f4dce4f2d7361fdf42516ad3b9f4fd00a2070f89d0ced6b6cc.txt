     * Get estimate of the relative precision of the alignment of the
     * ElapsedRealtimeNanos timestamp, with the reported measurements in
     * nanoseconds (68% confidence).
     *
     * This means that we have 68% confidence that the true timestamp of the
     * event is within ElapsedReatimeNanos +/- uncertainty.
     *
     * Example :
     *   - getElapsedRealtimeNanos() returns 10000000
     *   - getElapsedRealtimeUncertaintyNanos() returns 1000000 (equivalent to 1millisecond)
     *   This means that the event most likely happened between 9000000 and 11000000.
     *
     * @return uncertainty of elapsed real-time of fix, in nanoseconds.
