     * <p>This method should be called by clients wishing to apply insets corresponding to areas
     * obscured by window decorations or overlays. This can include the status and navigation bars,
     * action bars, input methods and more. New inset categories may be added in the future.
     * The method returns the insets provided minus any that were applied by this view or its
     * children.</p>
     *
     * <p>Clients wishing to provide custom behavior should override the
     * {@link #onApplyWindowInsets(WindowInsets)} method or alternatively provide a
     * {@link OnApplyWindowInsetsListener} via the
     * {@link #setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener) setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener}
     * method.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method replaces the older {@link #fitSystemWindows(Rect) fitSystemWindows} method.
