     * Places a new outgoing call to the provided address using the system telecom service with
     * the specified extras.
     *
     * This method is equivalent to placing an outgoing call using {@link Intent#ACTION_CALL},
     * except that the outgoing call will always be sent via the system telecom service. If
     * method-caller is either the user selected default dialer app or preloaded system dialer
     * app, then emergency calls will also be allowed.
     *
     * Placing a call via a managed {@link ConnectionService} requires permission:
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#CALL_PHONE}
     *
     * Usage example:
     * <pre>
     * Uri uri = Uri.fromParts("tel", "12345", null);
     * Bundle extras = new Bundle();
     * extras.putBoolean(TelecomManager.EXTRA_START_CALL_WITH_SPEAKERPHONE, true);
     * telecomManager.placeCall(uri, extras);
     * </pre>
     *
     * The following keys are supported in the supplied extras.
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@link #EXTRA_OUTGOING_CALL_EXTRAS}</li>
     *   <li>{@link #EXTRA_PHONE_ACCOUNT_HANDLE}</li>
     *   <li>{@link #EXTRA_START_CALL_WITH_SPEAKERPHONE}</li>
     *   <li>{@link #EXTRA_START_CALL_WITH_VIDEO_STATE}</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * An app which implements the self-managed {@link ConnectionService} API uses
     * {@link #placeCall(Uri, Bundle)} to inform Telecom of a new outgoing call.  A self-managed
     * {@link ConnectionService} must include {@link #EXTRA_PHONE_ACCOUNT_HANDLE} to specify its
     * associated {@link android.telecom.PhoneAccountHandle}.
     *
     * Self-managed {@link ConnectionService}s require permission
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#MANAGE_OWN_CALLS}.
     *
     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If this method is used to place an emergency call, it
     * is not guaranteed that the call will be placed on the {@link PhoneAccount} provided in
     * the {@link #EXTRA_PHONE_ACCOUNT_HANDLE} extra (if specified) and may be placed on another
     * {@link PhoneAccount} with the {@link PhoneAccount#CAPABILITY_PLACE_EMERGENCY_CALLS}
     * capability, depending on external factors, such as network conditions and Modem/SIM status.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param address The address to make the call to.
     * @param extras Bundle of extras to use with the call.
