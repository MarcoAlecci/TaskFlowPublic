         * This method gives a LayoutManager an opportunity to intercept the initial focus search
         * before the default behavior of {@link FocusFinder} is used. If this method returns
         * null FocusFinder will attempt to find a focusable child view. If it fails
         * then {@link #onFocusSearchFailed(View, int, RecyclerView.Recycler, RecyclerView.State)}
         * will be called to give the LayoutManager an opportunity to add new views for items
         * that did not have attached views representing them. The LayoutManager should not add
         * or remove views from this method.
         *
         * @param focused The currently focused view
         * @param direction One of {@link View#FOCUS_UP}, {@link View#FOCUS_DOWN},
         *                  {@link View#FOCUS_LEFT}, {@link View#FOCUS_RIGHT},
         *                  {@link View#FOCUS_BACKWARD}, {@link View#FOCUS_FORWARD}
         * @return A descendant view to focus or null to fall back to default behavior.
         *         The default implementation returns null.
