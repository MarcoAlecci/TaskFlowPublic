     * Start counting the number and aggregate size of memory allocations.
     *
     * <p>The {@link #startAllocCounting() start} method resets the counts and enables counting.
     * The {@link #stopAllocCounting() stop} method disables the counting so that the analysis
     * code doesn't cause additional allocations.  The various <code>get</code> methods return
     * the specified value. And the various <code>reset</code> methods reset the specified
     * count.</p>
     *
     * <p>Counts are kept for the system as a whole (global) and for each thread.
     * The per-thread counts for threads other than the current thread
     * are not cleared by the "reset" or "start" calls.</p>
     *
     * @deprecated Accurate counting is a burden on the runtime and may be removed.
