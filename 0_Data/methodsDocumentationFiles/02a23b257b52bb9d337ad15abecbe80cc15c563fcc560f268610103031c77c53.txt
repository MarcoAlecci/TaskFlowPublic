         * Sets whether the key will remain authorized only until the device is removed from the
         * user's body up to the limit of the authentication validity period (see
         * {@link #setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds} and
         * {@link #setUserAuthenticationRequired}). Once the device has been removed from the
         * user's body, the key will be considered unauthorized and the user will need to
         * re-authenticate to use it. For keys without an authentication validity period this
         * parameter has no effect.
         *
         * <p>Similarly, on devices that do not have an on-body sensor, this parameter will have no
         * effect; the device will always be considered to be "on-body" and the key will therefore
         * remain authorized until the validity period ends.
         *
         * @param remainsValid if {@code true}, and if the device supports on-body detection, key
         * will be invalidated when the device is removed from the user's body or when the
         * authentication validity expires, whichever occurs first.
