     * Returns object size in 64-bit integer.

     * Though MtpObjectInfo#getCompressedSize returns the object size in 32-bit unsigned integer,
     * this method returns the object size in 64-bit integer from the object property. Thus it can
     * fetch 4GB+ object size correctly. If the device does not support objectSize property, it
     * throws IOException.
