     * Return the FragmentManager for interacting with fragments associated
     * with this fragment's activity.  Note that this will be non-null slightly
     * before {@link #getActivity()}, during the time from when the fragment is
     * placed in a {@link FragmentTransaction} until it is committed and
     * attached to its activity.
     *
     * <p>If this Fragment is a child of another Fragment, the FragmentManager
     * returned here will be the parent's {@link #getChildFragmentManager()}.
