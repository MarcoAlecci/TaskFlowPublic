     * Adds the given transport type to this {@code NetworkCapability} instance.
     * Multiple transports may be applied.  Note that when searching
     * for a network to satisfy a request, any listed in the request will satisfy the request.
     * For example {@code TRANSPORT_WIFI} and {@code TRANSPORT_ETHERNET} added to a
     * {@code NetworkCapabilities} would cause either a Wi-Fi network or an Ethernet network
     * to be selected.  This is logically different than
     * {@code NetworkCapabilities.NET_CAPABILITY_*} listed above.
     *
     * @param transportType the transport type to be added.
     * @return This NetworkCapabilities instance, to facilitate chaining.
