     * Returns whether the shared/external storage media at the given path is
     * emulated.
     * <p>
     * The contents of emulated storage devices are backed by a private user
     * data partition, which means there is little benefit to apps storing data
     * here instead of the private directories returned by
     * {@link Context#getFilesDir()}, etc.
     * <p>
     * This returns true when emulated storage is backed by either internal
     * storage or an adopted storage device.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the path is not a valid storage
     *             device.
