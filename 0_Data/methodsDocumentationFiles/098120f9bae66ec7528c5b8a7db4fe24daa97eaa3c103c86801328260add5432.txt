     * Called when the application has reported a new selection region of
     * the text.  This is called whether or not the input method has requested
     * extracted text updates, although if so it will not receive this call
     * if the extracted text has changed as well.
     *
     * <p>Be careful about changing the text in reaction to this call with
     * methods such as setComposingText, commitText or
     * deleteSurroundingText. If the cursor moves as a result, this method
     * will be called again, which may result in an infinite loop.
     * 
     * <p>The default implementation takes care of updating the cursor in
     * the extract text, if it is being shown.
