     * Sets the strength of the virtualizer effect. If the implementation does not support per mille
     * accuracy for setting the strength, it is allowed to round the given strength to the nearest
     * supported value. You can use the {@link #getRoundedStrength()} method to query the
     * (possibly rounded) value that was actually set.
     * @param strength strength of the effect. The valid range for strength strength is [0, 1000],
     * where 0 per mille designates the mildest effect and 1000 per mille designates the strongest.
     * @throws IllegalStateException
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException
