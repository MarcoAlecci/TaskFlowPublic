         * Creates a measure specification based on the supplied size and mode.
         *
         * The mode must always be one of the following:
         * <ul>
         *  <li>{@link android.view.View.MeasureSpec#UNSPECIFIED}</li>
         *  <li>{@link android.view.View.MeasureSpec#EXACTLY}</li>
         *  <li>{@link android.view.View.MeasureSpec#AT_MOST}</li>
         * </ul>
         *
         * <p><strong>Note:</strong> On API level 17 and lower, makeMeasureSpec's
         * implementation was such that the order of arguments did not matter
         * and overflow in either value could impact the resulting MeasureSpec.
         * {@link android.widget.RelativeLayout} was affected by this bug.
         * Apps targeting API levels greater than 17 will get the fixed, more strict
         * behavior.</p>
         *
         * @param size the size of the measure specification
         * @param mode the mode of the measure specification
         * @return the measure specification based on size and mode
