     * Callback invoked when a observed cell info has changed or new cells have been added
     * or removed on the registered subscription.
     * Note, the registration subId s from {@link TelephonyManager} object which registers
     * PhoneStateListener by {@link TelephonyManager#listen(PhoneStateListener, int)}.
     * If this TelephonyManager object was created with
     * {@link TelephonyManager#createForSubscriptionId(int)}, then the callback applies to the
     * subId. Otherwise, this callback applies to
     * {@link SubscriptionManager#getDefaultSubscriptionId()}.
     *
     * @param cellInfo is the list of currently visible cells.
