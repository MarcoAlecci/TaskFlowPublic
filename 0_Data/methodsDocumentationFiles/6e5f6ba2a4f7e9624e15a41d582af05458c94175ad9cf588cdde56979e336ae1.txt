             * Detect attempts to invoke a method on a {@link Context} that is not suited for such
             * operation.
             * <p>An example of this is trying to obtain an instance of visual service (e.g.
             * {@link android.view.WindowManager}) from a non-visual {@link Context}. This is not
             * allowed, since a non-visual {@link Context} is not adjusted to any visual area, and
             * therefore can report incorrect metrics or resources.
             * @see Context#getDisplay()
             * @see Context#getSystemService(String)
             * @hide
