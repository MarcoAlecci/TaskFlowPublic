     * Indicates that the list of currently available SAIs has been updated. The app may use this
     * information to filter the list of group calls when displaying available group calls to
     * the user by matching the SAIs with a list of group calls separately negotiated with the
     * carrier. The app may also report the aggregate list of SAIs to the group call application
     * server so that a network entity can determine when, and where to activate the broadcast of
     * particular group calls.
     * @param currentSais The available SAIs on the current cell.
     * @param availableSais A list of lists of available SAIS in neighboring cells, where each list
     *                      contains the available SAIs in an individual cell.
