     * Register a callback to be invoked when an item has been clicked and the
     * caller prefers to receive a ListView-style position instead of a group
     * and/or child position. In most cases, the caller should use
     * {@link #setOnGroupClickListener} and/or {@link #setOnChildClickListener}.
