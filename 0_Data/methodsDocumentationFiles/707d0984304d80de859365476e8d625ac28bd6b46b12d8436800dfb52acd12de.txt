     * Report the completion of executing a {@link JobWorkItem} previously returned by
     * {@link #dequeueWork()}.  This tells the system you are done with the
     * work associated with that item, so it will not be returned again.  Note that if this
     * is the last work in the queue, completing it here will <em>not</em> finish the overall
     * job -- for that to happen, you still need to call {@link #dequeueWork()}
     * again.
     *
     * <p>If you are enqueueing work into a job, you must call this method for each piece
     * of work you process.  Do <em>not</em> call
     * {@link JobService#jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)}
     * or else you can lose work in your queue.</p>
     *
     * @param work The work you have completed processing, as previously returned by
     * {@link #dequeueWork()}
