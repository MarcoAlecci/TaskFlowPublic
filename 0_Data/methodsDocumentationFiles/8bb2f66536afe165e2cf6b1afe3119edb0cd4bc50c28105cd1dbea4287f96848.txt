     * Return a {@code Connection} which represents a failed connection attempt. The returned
     * {@code Connection} will have a {@link android.telecom.DisconnectCause} and as specified,
     * and a {@link #getState()} of {@link #STATE_DISCONNECTED}.
     * <p>
     * The returned {@code Connection} can be assumed to {@link #destroy()} itself when appropriate,
     * so users of this method need not maintain a reference to its return value to destroy it.
     *
     * @param disconnectCause The disconnect cause, ({@see android.telecomm.DisconnectCause}).
     * @return A {@code Connection} which indicates failure.
