     *
     * A waterfall display has curved areas along the edges of the screen. Apps should be careful
     * when showing UI and handling touch input in those insets because the curve may impair
     * legibility and can frequently lead to unintended touch inputs.
     *
     * @return the insets for the curved areas of a waterfall display in pixels or {@code
     * Insets.NONE} if there are no curved areas or they don't overlap with the window.
