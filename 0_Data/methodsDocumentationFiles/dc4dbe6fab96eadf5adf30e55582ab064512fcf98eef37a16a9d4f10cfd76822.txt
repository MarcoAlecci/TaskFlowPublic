     * Constructs a stream that reads bytes from the given channel.
     *
     * <p> The stream will not be buffered, and it will not support the {@link
     * InputStream#mark mark} or {@link InputStream#reset reset} methods.  The
     * stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads.  Closing
     * the stream will in turn cause the channel to be closed.  </p>
     *
     * @param  ch
     *         The channel from which bytes will be read
     *
     * @return  A new input stream
