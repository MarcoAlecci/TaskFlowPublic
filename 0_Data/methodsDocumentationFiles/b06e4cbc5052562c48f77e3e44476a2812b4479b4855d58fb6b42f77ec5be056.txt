     * Returns the ViewGroupOverlay for this view group, creating it if it does
     * not yet exist. In addition to {@link ViewOverlay}'s support for drawables,
     * {@link ViewGroupOverlay} allows views to be added to the overlay. These
     * views, like overlay drawables, are visual-only; they do not receive input
     * events and should not be used as anything other than a temporary
     * representation of a view in a parent container, such as might be used
     * by an animation effect.
     *
     * <p>Note: Overlays do not currently work correctly with {@link
     * SurfaceView} or {@link TextureView}; contents in overlays for these
     * types of views may not display correctly.</p>

     * @return The ViewGroupOverlay object for this view.
