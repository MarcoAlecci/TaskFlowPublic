     * Gets the Automatic Gain Control level in dB.

     * <p> AGC acts as a variable gain amplifier adjusting the power of the incoming signal. The AGC
     * level may be used to indicate potential interference. When AGC is at a nominal level, this
     * value must be set as 0. Higher gain (and/or lower input power) shall be output as a positive
     * number. Hence in cases of strong jamming, in the band of this signal, this value will go more
     * negative.
     *
     * <p> Note: Different hardware designs (e.g. antenna, pre-amplification, or other RF HW
     * components) may also affect the typical output of of this value on any given hardware design
     * in an open sky test - the important aspect of this output is that changes in this value are
     * indicative of changes on input signal power in the frequency band for this measurement.
     *
     * <p> The value is only available if {@link #hasAutomaticGainControlLevelDb()} is {@code true}
