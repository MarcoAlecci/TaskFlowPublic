     * Returns this {@code BigInteger} as a float. If {@code this} is too big to
     * be represented as a float, then {@code Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY} or
     * {@code Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY} is returned. Note that not all integers
     * in the range {@code [-Float.MAX_VALUE, Float.MAX_VALUE]} can be exactly
     * represented as a float.
