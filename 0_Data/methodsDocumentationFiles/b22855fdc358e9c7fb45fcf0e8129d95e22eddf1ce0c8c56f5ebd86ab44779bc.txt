     * Equivalent to calling {@link ViewGroup#addView(View)} after inflating the
     * given {@link RemoteViews}. This allows users to build "nested"
     * {@link RemoteViews}. In cases where consumers of {@link RemoteViews} may
     * recycle layouts, use {@link #removeAllViews(int)} to clear any existing
     * children.
     *
     * @param viewId The id of the parent {@link ViewGroup} to add child into.
     * @param nestedView {@link RemoteViews} that describes the child.
