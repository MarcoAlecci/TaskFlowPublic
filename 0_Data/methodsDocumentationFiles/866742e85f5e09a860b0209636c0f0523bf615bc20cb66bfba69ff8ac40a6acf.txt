     * For jobs with {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setOverrideDeadline(long)} set, this
     * provides an easy way to tell whether the job is being executed due to the deadline
     * expiring. Note: If the job is running because its deadline expired, it implies that its
     * constraints will not be met.
