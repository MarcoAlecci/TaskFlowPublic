     * Sets the color of the ambient shadow that is drawn when the RenderNode has a positive Z or
     * elevation value and is drawn inside of a {@link Canvas#enableZ()} section.
     * <p>
     * By default the shadow color is black. Generally, this color will be opaque so the intensity
     * of the shadow is consistent between different RenderNodes with different colors.
     * <p>
     * The opacity of the final ambient shadow is a function of the shadow caster height, the
     * alpha channel of the outlineAmbientShadowColor (typically opaque), and the
     * {@link android.R.attr#ambientShadowAlpha} theme attribute.
     *
     * @param color The color this RenderNode will cast for its elevation shadow.
     * @return True if the value changed, false if the new value was the same as the previous value.
