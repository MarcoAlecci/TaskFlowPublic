     *
     * When the prompt is no longer being presented, one of the methods in
     * {@link ConfirmationCallback} is called on the supplied callback object.
     *
     * Confirmation prompts may not be available when accessibility services are running so this
     * may fail with a {@link ConfirmationNotAvailableException} exception even if
     * {@link #isSupported} returns {@code true}.
     *
     * @param executor the executor identifying the thread that will receive the callback.
     * @param callback the callback to use when the prompt is done showing.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the prompt text is too long or malfomed.
     * @throws ConfirmationAlreadyPresentingException if another prompt is being presented.
     * @throws ConfirmationNotAvailableException if confirmation prompts are not supported.
