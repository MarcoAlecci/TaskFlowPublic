     * Handle a key event before it is processed by any input method
     * associated with the view hierarchy.  This can be used to intercept
     * key events in special situations before the IME consumes them; a
     * typical example would be handling the BACK key to update the application's
     * UI instead of allowing the IME to see it and close itself.
     *
     * @param keyCode The value in event.getKeyCode().
     * @param event Description of the key event.
     * @return If you handled the event, return true. If you want to allow the
     *         event to be handled by the next receiver, return false.
