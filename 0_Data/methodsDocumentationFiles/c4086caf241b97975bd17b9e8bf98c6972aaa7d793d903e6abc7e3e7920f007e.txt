     * @implSpec
     * This implementation iterates over <tt>entrySet()</tt> searching
     * for an entry with the specified value.  If such an entry is found,
     * <tt>true</tt> is returned.  If the iteration terminates without
     * finding such an entry, <tt>false</tt> is returned.  Note that this
     * implementation requires linear time in the size of the map.
