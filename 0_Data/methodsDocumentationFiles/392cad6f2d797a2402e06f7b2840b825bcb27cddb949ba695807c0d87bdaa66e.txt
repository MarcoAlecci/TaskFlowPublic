     * Calling this method triggers telephony services to fetch the current carrier configuration.
     * <p>
     * Normally this does not need to be called because the platform reloads config on its own.
     * This should be called by a carrier service app if it wants to update config at an arbitrary
     * moment.
     * </p>
     * <p>Requires that the calling app has carrier privileges.
     * <p>
     * This method returns before the reload has completed, and
     * {@link android.service.carrier.CarrierService#onLoadConfig} will be called from an
     * arbitrary thread.
