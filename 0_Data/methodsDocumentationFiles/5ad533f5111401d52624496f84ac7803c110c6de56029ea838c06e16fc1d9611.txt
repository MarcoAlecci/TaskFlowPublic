     * This method determines which menu items get to be 'action items' that will appear
     * in an action bar and which items should be 'overflow items' in a secondary menu.
     * The rules are as follows:
     *
     * <p>Items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu.
     * There is a limit of mMaxActionItems as a total count, optionally including the overflow
     * menu button itself. This is a soft limit; if an item shares a group ID with an item
     * previously included as an action item, the new item will stay with its group and become
     * an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit. This is done to
     * limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar. Only a few
     * unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space, and groups are treated
     * as a single concept.
     *
     * <p>There is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space: mActionWidthLimit. This
     * limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space, but no further
     * items may be added. If an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining
     * measured width, the entire group will be demoted to overflow. This is done to ensure room
     * for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general UI clutter.
     *
     * <p>The space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items.
     * Once items begin to overflow, all future items become overflow items as well. This is
     * to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app's intended design.
