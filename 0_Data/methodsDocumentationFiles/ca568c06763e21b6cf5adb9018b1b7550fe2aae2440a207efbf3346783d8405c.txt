     * Set a network-independent global HTTP proxy. This is not normally what you want for typical
     * HTTP proxies - they are generally network dependent. However if you're doing something
     * unusual like general internal filtering this may be useful. On a private network where the
     * proxy is not accessible, you may break HTTP using this.
     * <p>
     * This method requires the caller to be the device owner.
     * <p>
     * This proxy is only a recommendation and it is possible that some apps will ignore it.
     *
     * @see ProxyInfo
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param proxyInfo The a {@link ProxyInfo} object defining the new global HTTP proxy. A
     *            {@code null} value will clear the global HTTP proxy.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not the device owner.
