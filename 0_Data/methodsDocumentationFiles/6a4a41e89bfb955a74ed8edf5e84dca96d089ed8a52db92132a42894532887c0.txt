     * If the audio track was flushed as a result of {@link #flush}, it will be restarted.
     * @param audioData the buffer that holds the data to play. This buffer will be returned
     *     to the client via registered callback.
     * @param bufferId an integer used to identify audioData. It will be returned to
     *     the client along with audioData. This helps applications to keep track of audioData,
     *     e.g., it can be used to store the output buffer index used by the audio codec.
     * @param presentationTimeUs the presentation timestamp in microseconds for the first frame
     *     in the buffer.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if audio track is not set or internal configureation
