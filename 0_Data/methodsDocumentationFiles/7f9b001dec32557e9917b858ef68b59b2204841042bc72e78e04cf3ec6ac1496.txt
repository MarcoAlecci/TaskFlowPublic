     * {@code release()} frees all the buffers and puts the SurfaceTexture into the
     * 'abandoned' state. Once put in this state the SurfaceTexture can never
     * leave it. When in the 'abandoned' state, all methods of the
     * {@code IGraphicBufferProducer} interface will fail with the {@code NO_INIT}
     * error.
     * <p>
     * Note that while calling this method causes all the buffers to be freed
     * from the perspective of the the SurfaceTexture, if there are additional
     * references on the buffers (e.g. if a buffer is referenced by a client or
     * by OpenGL ES as a texture) then those buffer will remain allocated.
     * <p>
     * Always call this method when you are done with SurfaceTexture. Failing
     * to do so may delay resource deallocation for a significant amount of
     * time.
