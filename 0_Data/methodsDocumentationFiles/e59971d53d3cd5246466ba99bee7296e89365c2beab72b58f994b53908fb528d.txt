     * <p>Some color formats may be overridden by the producer sending buffers to
     * this ImageReader's Surface if the default color format allows. ImageReader
     * guarantees that all {@link Image Images} acquired from ImageReader
     * (for example, with {@link #acquireNextImage}) will have a "compatible"
     * format to what was specified in {@link #newInstance}.
     * As of now, each format is only compatible to itself.
     * The actual format of the images can be found using {@link Image#getFormat}.</p>
