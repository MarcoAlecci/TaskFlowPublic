     * Forgets a saved password.  This erases the local copy of the password;
     * it does not change the user's account password on the server.
     * Has the same effect as setPassword(account, null) but requires fewer
     * permissions, and may be used by applications or management interfaces
     * to "sign out" from an account.
     *
     * <p>This method only successfully clear the account's password when the
     * caller has the same signature as the authenticator that owns the
     * specified account. Otherwise, this method will silently fail.
     *
     * <p>It is safe to call this method from the main thread.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If targeting your app to work on API level 22 and before,
     * MANAGE_ACCOUNTS permission is needed for those platforms. See docs for
     * this function in API level 22.
