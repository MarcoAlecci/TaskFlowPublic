         * Sets whether or not {@link #syncAndDraw()} should block until the frame has been
         * presented. If this is true and {@link #syncAndDraw()} does not return
         * {@link #SYNC_FRAME_DROPPED} or an error then when {@link #syncAndDraw()} has returned
         * the frame has been submitted to the {@link Surface}. The default and typically
         * recommended value is false, as blocking for present will prevent pipelining from
         * happening, reducing overall throughput. This is useful for situations such as
         * {@link SurfaceHolder.Callback2#surfaceRedrawNeeded(SurfaceHolder)} where it is desired
         * to block until a frame has been presented to ensure first-frame consistency with
         * other Surfaces.
         *
         * @param shouldWait If true the next call to {@link #syncAndDraw()} will block until
         *                   completion.
         * @return this instance
