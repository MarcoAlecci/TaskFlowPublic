         * Sets whether this key should be invalidated on biometric enrollment.  This
         * applies only to keys which require user authentication (see {@link
         * #setUserAuthenticationRequired(boolean)}) and if no positive validity duration has been
         * set (see {@link #setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(int)}, meaning the key is
         * valid for biometric authentication only.
         *
         * <p>By default, {@code invalidateKey} is {@code true}, so keys that are valid for
         * biometric authentication only are <em>irreversibly invalidated</em> when a new
         * biometric is enrolled, or when all existing biometrics are deleted.  That may be
         * changed by calling this method with {@code invalidateKey} set to {@code false}.
         *
         * <p>Invalidating keys on enrollment of a new biometric or unenrollment of all biometrics
         * improves security by ensuring that an unauthorized person who obtains the password can't
         * gain the use of biometric-authenticated keys by enrolling their own biometric.  However,
         * invalidating keys makes key-dependent operations impossible, requiring some fallback
         * procedure to authenticate the user and set up a new key.
