     * Gets the environment bearing uncertainty in degrees. It represents the standard deviation of
     * the physical structure in the circle of position uncertainty. The uncertainty can take values
     * between 0 and 180 degrees. The {@link #hasEnvironmentBearing} becomes false as the
     * uncertainty value passes a predefined threshold depending on the physical structure around
     * the user.
     *
     * {@link #hasEnvironmentBearing} should be called to check the environment bearing is available
     * before calling this method. The value is undefined if {@link #hasEnvironmentBearing} returns
     * false.
