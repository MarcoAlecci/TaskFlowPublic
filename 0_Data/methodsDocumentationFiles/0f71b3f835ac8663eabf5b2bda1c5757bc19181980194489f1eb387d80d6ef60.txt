     * Returns the ViewTreeObserver for this view's hierarchy. The view tree
     * observer can be used to get notifications when global events, like
     * layout, happen.
     *
     * The returned ViewTreeObserver observer is not guaranteed to remain
     * valid for the lifetime of this View. If the caller of this method keeps
     * a long-lived reference to ViewTreeObserver, it should always check for
     * the return value of {@link ViewTreeObserver#isAlive()}.
