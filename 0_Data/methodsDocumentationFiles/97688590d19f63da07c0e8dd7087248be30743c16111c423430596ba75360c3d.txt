     * Notify registered observers that a row was updated.
     * <p>
     * To observe events sent through this call, use
     * {@link #registerContentObserver(Uri, boolean, ContentObserver)}.
     * <p>
     * If syncToNetwork is true, this will attempt to schedule a local sync
     * using the sync adapter that's registered for the authority of the
     * provided uri. No account will be passed to the sync adapter, so all
     * matching accounts will be synchronized.
     * <p>
     * Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O}, all content
     * notifications must be backed by a valid {@link ContentProvider}.
     *
     * @param uri The uri of the content that was changed.
     * @param observer The observer that originated the change, may be
     *            <code>null</null>. The observer that originated the change
     *            will only receive the notification if it has requested to
     *            receive self-change notifications by implementing
     *            {@link ContentObserver#deliverSelfNotifications()} to return
     *            true.
     * @param syncToNetwork If true, same as {@link #NOTIFY_SYNC_TO_NETWORK}.
     * @see #requestSync(android.accounts.Account, String, android.os.Bundle)
     * @deprecated callers should consider migrating to
     *             {@link #notifyChange(Uri, ContentObserver, int)}, as it
     *             offers support for many more options than just
     *             {@link #NOTIFY_SYNC_TO_NETWORK}.
