     * Dispatch a gesture to the touch screen. Any gestures currently in progress, whether from
     * the user, this service, or another service, will be cancelled.
     * <p>
     * The gesture will be dispatched as if it were performed directly on the screen by a user, so
     * the events may be affected by features such as magnification and explore by touch.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> In order to dispatch gestures, your service
     * must declare the capability by setting the
     * {@link android.R.styleable#AccessibilityService_canPerformGestures}
     * property in its meta-data. For more information, see
     * {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA}.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param gesture The gesture to dispatch
     * @param callback The object to call back when the status of the gesture is known. If
     * {@code null}, no status is reported.
     * @param handler The handler on which to call back the {@code callback} object. If
     * {@code null}, the object is called back on the service's main thread.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the gesture is dispatched, {@code false} if not.
