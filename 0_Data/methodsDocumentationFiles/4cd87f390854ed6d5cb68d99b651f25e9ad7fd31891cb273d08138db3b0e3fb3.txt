     * This method adds a view to this container at the specified index purely for the
     * purposes of allowing that view to draw even though it is not a normal child of
     * the container. That is, the view does not participate in layout, focus, accessibility,
     * input, or other normal view operations; it is purely an item to be drawn during the normal
     * rendering operation of this container. The index that it is added at is the order
     * in which it will be drawn, with respect to the other views in the container.
     * For example, a transient view added at index 0 will be drawn before all other views
     * in the container because it will be drawn first (including before any real view
     * at index 0). There can be more than one transient view at any particular index;
     * these views will be drawn in the order in which they were added to the list of
     * transient views. The index of transient views can also be greater than the number
     * of normal views in the container; that just means that they will be drawn after all
     * other views are drawn.
     *
     * <p>Note that since transient views do not participate in layout, they must be sized
     * manually or, more typically, they should just use the size that they had before they
     * were removed from their container.</p>
     *
     * <p>Transient views are useful for handling animations of views that have been removed
     * from the container, but which should be animated out after the removal. Adding these
     * views as transient views allows them to participate in drawing without side-effecting
     * the layout of the container.</p>
     *
     * <p>Transient views must always be explicitly {@link #removeTransientView(View) removed}
     * from the container when they are no longer needed. For example, a transient view
     * which is added in order to fade it out in its old location should be removed
     * once the animation is complete.</p>
     *
     * @param view The view to be added. The view must not have a parent.
     * @param index The index at which this view should be drawn, must be >= 0.
     * This value is relative to the {@link #getChildAt(int) index} values in the normal
     * child list of this container, where any transient view at a particular index will
     * be drawn before any normal child at that same index.
