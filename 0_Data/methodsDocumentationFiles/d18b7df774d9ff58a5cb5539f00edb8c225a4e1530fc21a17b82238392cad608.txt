     * Gets the leap second associated with the clock's time.
     *
     * <p>The sign of the value is defined by the following equation:
     * <pre>
     *     UtcTimeNanos = TimeNanos - (FullBiasNanos + BiasNanos) - LeapSecond * 1,000,000,000</pre>
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasLeapSecond()} is {@code true}.
