     * Returns any packages in a given set of packages that cannot be suspended via a call to {@link
     * #setPackagesSuspended(String[], boolean, PersistableBundle, PersistableBundle,
     * SuspendDialogInfo) setPackagesSuspended}. The platform prevents suspending certain critical
     * packages to keep the device in a functioning state, e.g. the default dialer and launcher.
     * Apps need to hold {@link Manifest.permission#SUSPEND_APPS SUSPEND_APPS} to call this API.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that this set of critical packages can change with time, so even though a package name
     * was not returned by this call, it does not guarantee that a subsequent call to
     * {@link #setPackagesSuspended(String[], boolean, PersistableBundle, PersistableBundle,
     * SuspendDialogInfo) setPackagesSuspended} for that package will succeed, especially if
     * significant time elapsed between the two calls.
     *
     * @param packageNames The packages to check.
     * @return A list of packages that can not be currently suspended by the system.
     * @hide
