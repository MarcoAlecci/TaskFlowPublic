     * Like {@link #disableCarrierAppsUntilPrivileged(String, TelephonyManager, int, Context)},
     * but assumes that no carrier apps have carrier privileges.
     *
     * This prevents a potential race condition on first boot - since the app's default state is
     * enabled, we will initially disable it when the telephony stack is first initialized as it has
     * not yet read the carrier privilege rules. However, since telephony is initialized later on
     * late in boot, the app being disabled may have already been started in response to certain
     * broadcasts. The app will continue to run (briefly) after being disabled, before the Package
     * Manager can kill it, and this can lead to crashes as the app is in an unexpected state.
