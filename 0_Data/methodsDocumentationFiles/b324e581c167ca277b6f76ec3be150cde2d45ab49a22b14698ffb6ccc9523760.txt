     * Set a network-independent global http proxy.  This is not normally what you want
     * for typical HTTP proxies - they are general network dependent.  However if you're
     * doing something unusual like general internal filtering this may be useful.  On
     * a private network where the proxy is not accessible, you may break HTTP using this.
     *
     * @param p A {@link ProxyInfo} object defining the new global
     *        HTTP proxy.  A {@code null} value will clear the global HTTP proxy.
