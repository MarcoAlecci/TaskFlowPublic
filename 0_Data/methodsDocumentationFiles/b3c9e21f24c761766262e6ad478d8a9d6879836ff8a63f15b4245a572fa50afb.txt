     * Gets the last known location from the given provider, or null if there is no last known
     * location. The returned location may be quite old in some circumstances, so the age of the
     * location should always be checked.
     *
     * <p>This will never activate sensors to compute a new location, and will only ever return a
     * cached location.
     *
     * <p>See also {@link #getCurrentLocation(String, CancellationSignal, Executor, Consumer)} which
     * will always attempt to return a current location, but will potentially use additional power
     * in the course of the attempt as compared to this method.
     *
     * @param provider a provider listed by {@link #getAllProviders()}
     * @return the last known location for the given provider, or null if not available
     * @throws SecurityException if no suitable permission is present
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if provider is null or doesn't exist
