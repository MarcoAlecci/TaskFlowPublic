     * Appends a subsequence of the character sequence {@code csq} to the
     * target. This method works the same way as {@code
     * PrintWriter.print(csq.subsequence(start, end).toString())}. If {@code
     * csq} is {@code null}, then the specified subsequence of the string "null"
     * will be written to the target.
     *
     * @param csq
     *            the character sequence appended to the target.
     * @param start
     *            the index of the first char in the character sequence appended
     *            to the target.
     * @param end
     *            the index of the character following the last character of the
     *            subsequence appended to the target.
     * @return this writer.
     * @throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
     *             if {@code start > end}, {@code start < 0}, {@code end < 0} or
     *             either {@code start} or {@code end} are greater or equal than
     *             the length of {@code csq}.
