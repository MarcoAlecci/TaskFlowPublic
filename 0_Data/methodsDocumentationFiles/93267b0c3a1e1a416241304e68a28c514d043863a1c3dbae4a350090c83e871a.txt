     * Updates the current state of dynamic power savings and disable threshold. This is
     * a signal to the system which an app can update to serve as an indicator that
     * the user will be in a battery critical situation before being able to plug in.
     * Only apps with the {@link android.Manifest.permission#POWER_SAVER} permission may do this.
     * This is a device global state, not a per user setting.
     *
     * <p>When enabled, the system may enact various measures for reducing power consumption in
     * order to help ensure that the user will make it to their next charging point. The most
     * visible of these will be the automatic enabling of battery saver if the user has set
     * their battery saver mode to "automatic". Note
     * that this is NOT simply an on/off switch for features, but rather a hint for the
     * system to consider enacting these power saving features, some of which have additional
     * logic around when to activate based on this signal.
     *
     * <p>The provided threshold is the percentage the system should consider itself safe at given
     * the current state of the device. The value is an integer representing a battery level.
     *
     * <p>The threshold is meant to set an explicit stopping point for dynamic power savings
     * functionality so that the dynamic power savings itself remains a signal rather than becoming
     * an on/off switch for a subset of features.

     * @param powerSaveHint A signal indicating to the system if it believes the
     * dynamic power savings behaviors should be activated.
     * @param disableThreshold When the suggesting app believes it would be safe to disable dynamic
     * power savings behaviors.
     * @return True if the update was allowed and succeeded.
