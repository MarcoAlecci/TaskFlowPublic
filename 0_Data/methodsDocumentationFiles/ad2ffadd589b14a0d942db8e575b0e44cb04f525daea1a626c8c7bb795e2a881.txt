     * the current count is 0, the acquired method is called on the given
     * handler.
     *
     * Note that the same {@code token} can only be acquired once. If this
     * {@code token} has already been acquired, no action is taken. The first
     * subsequent call to {@link #release} will release this {@code token}
     * immediately.
     *
