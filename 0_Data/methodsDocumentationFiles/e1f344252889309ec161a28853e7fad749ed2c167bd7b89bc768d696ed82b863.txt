     * Register a callback to be notified about torch mode status.
     *
     * <p>Registering the same callback again will replace the handler with the
     * new one provided.</p>
     *
     * <p>The first time a callback is registered, it is immediately called
     * with the torch mode status of all currently known camera devices with a flash unit.</p>
     *
     * <p>Since this callback will be registered with the camera service, remember to unregister it
     * once it is no longer needed; otherwise the callback will continue to receive events
     * indefinitely and it may prevent other resources from being released. Specifically, the
     * callbacks will be invoked independently of the general activity lifecycle and independently
     * of the state of individual CameraManager instances.</p>
     *
     * @param callback The new callback to send torch mode status to
     * @param handler The handler on which the callback should be invoked, or {@code null} to use
     *             the current thread's {@link android.os.Looper looper}.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the handler is {@code null} but the current thread has
     *             no looper.
