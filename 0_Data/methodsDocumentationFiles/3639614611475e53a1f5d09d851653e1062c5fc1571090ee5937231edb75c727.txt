         * This is called when the start position for time shifting has changed.
         *
         * <p>The start position for time shifting indicates the earliest possible time the user can
         * seek to. Initially this is equivalent to the time when the underlying TV input starts
         * recording. Later it may be adjusted because there is insufficient space or the duration
         * of recording is limited. The application must not allow the user to seek to a position
         * earlier than the start position.
         *
         * <p>For playback of a recorded program initiated by {@link #timeShiftPlay(String, Uri)},
         * the start position is the time when playback starts. It does not change.
         *
         * @param inputId The ID of the TV input bound to this view.
         * @param timeMs The start position for time shifting, in milliseconds since the epoch.
