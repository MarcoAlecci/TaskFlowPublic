     * Begins a transaction in EXCLUSIVE mode.
     * <p>
     * Transactions can be nested.
     * When the outer transaction is ended all of
     * the work done in that transaction and all of the nested transactions will be committed or
     * rolled back. The changes will be rolled back if any transaction is ended without being
     * marked as clean (by calling setTransactionSuccessful). Otherwise they will be committed.
     * </p>
     * <p>Here is the standard idiom for transactions:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   db.beginTransactionWithListener(listener);
     *   try {
     *     ...
     *     db.setTransactionSuccessful();
     *   } finally {
     *     db.endTransaction();
     *   }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param transactionListener listener that should be notified when the transaction begins,
     * commits, or is rolled back, either explicitly or by a call to
     * {@link #yieldIfContendedSafely}.
