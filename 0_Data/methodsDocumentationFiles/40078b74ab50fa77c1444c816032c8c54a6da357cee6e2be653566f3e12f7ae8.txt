     * Copy an array into a 1D region of this Allocation.  This method does not
     * guarantee that the Allocation is compatible with the input buffer.
     *
     * <p> The size of the region is: count * {@link #getElement}.{@link
     * Element#getBytesSize}.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation does not have Vec3 Elements, then the size of the
     * array in bytes must be at least the size of the region.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation has Vec3 Elements and {@link #setAutoPadding AutoPadding}
     * is disabled, then the size of the array in bytes must be at least the size
     * of the region. The padding bytes for the cells must be part of the array.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation has Vec3 Elements and {@link #setAutoPadding AutoPadding}
     * is enabled, then the size of the array in bytes must be at least 3/4 the size
     * of the region. The padding bytes for the cells must not be part of the array.
     *
     * @param off The offset of the first element to be copied.
     * @param count The number of elements to be copied.
     * @param d the source array
