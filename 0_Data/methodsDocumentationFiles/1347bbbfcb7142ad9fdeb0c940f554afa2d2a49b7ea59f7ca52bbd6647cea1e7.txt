         * An alternative to surfaceRedrawNeeded where it is not required to block
         * until the redraw is complete. You should initiate the redraw, and return,
         * later invoking drawingFinished when your redraw is complete.
         *
         * This can be useful to avoid blocking your main application thread on rendering.
         *
         * As of O, if this is implemented {@link #surfaceRedrawNeeded} will not be called.
         * However it is still recommended to implement {@link #surfaceRedrawNeeded} for
         * compatibility with older versions of the platform.
         *
         * @param holder The SurfaceHolder which needs redrawing.
         * @param drawingFinished A runnable to signal completion. This may be invoked
         * from any thread.
