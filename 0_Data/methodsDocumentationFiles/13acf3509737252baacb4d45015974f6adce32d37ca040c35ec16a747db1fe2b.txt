     * Called when a context menu for the {@code view} is about to be shown.
     * Unlike {@link #onCreateOptionsMenu}, this will be called every
     * time the context menu is about to be shown and should be populated for
     * the view (or item inside the view for {@link AdapterView} subclasses,
     * this can be found in the {@code menuInfo})).
     * <p>
     * Use {@link #onContextItemSelected(android.view.MenuItem)} to know when an
     * item has been selected.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation calls up to
     * {@link Activity#onCreateContextMenu Activity.onCreateContextMenu}, though
     * you can not call this implementation if you don't want that behavior.
     * <p>
     * It is not safe to hold onto the context menu after this method returns.
