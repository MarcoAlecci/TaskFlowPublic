         * Called by the RecyclerView before the layout begins. Item animator should record
         * necessary information about the View before it is potentially rebound, moved or removed.
         * <p>
         * The data returned from this method will be passed to the related <code>animate**</code>
         * methods.
         * <p>
         * Note that this method may be called after pre-layout phase if LayoutManager adds new
         * Views to the layout in pre-layout pass.
         * <p>
         * The default implementation returns an {@link ItemHolderInfo} which holds the bounds of
         * the View and the adapter change flags.
         *
         * @param state       The current State of RecyclerView which includes some useful data
         *                    about the layout that will be calculated.
         * @param viewHolder  The ViewHolder whose information should be recorded.
         * @param changeFlags Additional information about what changes happened in the Adapter
         *                    about the Item represented by this ViewHolder. For instance, if
         *                    item is deleted from the adapter, {@link #FLAG_REMOVED} will be set.
         * @param payloads    The payload list that was previously passed to
         *                    {@link Adapter#notifyItemChanged(int, Object)} or
         *                    {@link Adapter#notifyItemRangeChanged(int, int, Object)}.
         *
         * @return An ItemHolderInfo instance that preserves necessary information about the
         * ViewHolder. This object will be passed back to related <code>animate**</code> methods
         * after layout is complete.
