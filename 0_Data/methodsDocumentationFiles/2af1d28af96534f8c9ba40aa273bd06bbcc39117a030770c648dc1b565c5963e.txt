     * Returns the approximate initial bearing in degrees East of true
     * North when traveling along the shortest path between this
     * location and the given location.  The shortest path is defined
     * using the WGS84 ellipsoid.  Locations that are (nearly)
     * antipodal may produce meaningless results.
