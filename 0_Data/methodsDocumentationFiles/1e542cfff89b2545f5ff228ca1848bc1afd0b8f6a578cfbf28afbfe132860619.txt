         * Indicates whether the surface must be considered opaque,
         * even if its pixel format is set to translucent. This can be useful if an
         * application needs full RGBA 8888 support for instance but will
         * still draw every pixel opaque.
         * <p>
         * This flag only determines whether opacity will be sampled from the alpha channel.
         * Plane-alpha from calls to setAlpha() can still result in blended composition
         * regardless of the opaque setting.
         *
         * Combined effects are (assuming a buffer format with an alpha channel):
         * <ul>
         * <li>OPAQUE + alpha(1.0) == opaque composition
         * <li>OPAQUE + alpha(0.x) == blended composition
         * <li>OPAQUE + alpha(0.0) == no composition
         * <li>!OPAQUE + alpha(1.0) == blended composition
         * <li>!OPAQUE + alpha(0.x) == blended composition
         * <li>!OPAQUE + alpha(0.0) == no composition
         * </ul>
         * If the underlying buffer lacks an alpha channel, it is as if setOpaque(true)
         * were set automatically.
         * @param opaque Whether the Surface is OPAQUE.
