     * Make an Intent for the main activity of an application, without
     * specifying a specific activity to run but giving a selector to find
     * the activity.  This results in a final Intent that is structured
     * the same as when the application is launched from
     * Home.  For anything else that wants to launch an application in the
     * same way, it is important that they use an Intent structured the same
     * way, and can use this function to ensure this is the case.
     *
     * <p>The returned Intent has {@link #ACTION_MAIN} as its action, and includes the
     * category {@link #CATEGORY_LAUNCHER}.  This does <em>not</em> have
     * {@link #FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} set, though typically you will want
     * to do that through {@link #addFlags(int)} on the returned Intent.
     *
     * @param selectorAction The action name of the Intent's selector.
     * @param selectorCategory The name of a category to add to the Intent's
     * selector.
     * @return Returns a newly created Intent that can be used to launch the
     * activity as a main application entry.
