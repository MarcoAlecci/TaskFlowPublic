     * Creates a Bitmap of the given view, using the Matrix matrix to transform to the local
     * coordinates. <code>matrix</code> will be modified during the bitmap creation.
     *
     * <p>If the bitmap is large, it will be scaled uniformly down to at most 1MB size.</p>
     * @param view The view to create a bitmap for.
     * @param matrix The matrix converting the view local coordinates to the coordinates that
     *               the bitmap will be displayed in. <code>matrix</code> will be modified before
     *               returning.
     * @param bounds The bounds of the bitmap in the destination coordinate system (where the
     *               view should be presented. Typically, this is matrix.mapRect(viewBounds);
     * @param sceneRoot A ViewGroup that is attached to the window to temporarily contain the view
     *                  if it isn't attached to the window.
     * @return A bitmap of the given view or null if bounds has no width or height.
