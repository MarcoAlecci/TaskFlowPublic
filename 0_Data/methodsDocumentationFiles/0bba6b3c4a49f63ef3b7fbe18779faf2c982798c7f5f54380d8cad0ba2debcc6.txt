     * Request unbuffered dispatch of the given stream of MotionEvents to this View.
     *
     * Until this View receives a corresponding {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_UP}, ask that the input
     * system not batch {@link MotionEvent}s but instead deliver them as soon as they're
     * available. This method should only be called for touch events.
     *
     * <p class="note">This API is not intended for most applications. Buffered dispatch
     * provides many of benefits, and just requesting unbuffered dispatch on most MotionEvent
     * streams will not improve your input latency. Side effects include: increased latency,
     * jittery scrolls and inability to take advantage of system resampling. Talk to your input
     * professional to see if {@link #requestUnbufferedDispatch(MotionEvent)} is right for
     * you.</p>
     *
     * To receive unbuffered events for arbitrary input device source classes, use
     * {@link #requestUnbufferedDispatch(int)},
