     * Returns the pointer icon for the motion event, or null if it doesn't specify the icon.
     * The default implementation does not care the location or event types, but some subclasses
     * may use it (such as WebViews).
     * @param event The MotionEvent from a mouse
     * @param pointerIndex The index of the pointer for which to retrieve the {@link PointerIcon}.
     *                     This will be between 0 and {@link MotionEvent#getPointerCount()}.
     * @see PointerIcon
