     * Adds the Class of a target view that this Transition is interested in
     * animating. By default, there are no targetTypes, and a Transition will
     * listen for changes on every view in the hierarchy below the sceneRoot
     * of the Scene being transitioned into. Setting targetTypes constrains
     * the Transition to only listen for, and act on, views with these classes.
     * Views with different classes will be ignored.
     *
     * <p>Note that any View that can be cast to targetType will be included, so
     * if targetType is <code>View.class</code>, all Views will be included.</p>
