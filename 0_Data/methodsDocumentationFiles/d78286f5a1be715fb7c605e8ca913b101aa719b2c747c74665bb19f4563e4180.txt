     * Determine if a package is hidden. This function can be called by a device owner, profile
     * owner, or by a delegate given the {@link #DELEGATION_PACKAGE_ACCESS} scope via
     * {@link #setDelegatedScopes}.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance, returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)}, where the caller must be the profile owner
     * of an organization-owned managed profile and the package must be a system package. If called
     * on the parent instance, this will determine whether the package is hidden or unhidden in the
     * personal profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or
     *            {@code null} if the caller is a package access delegate.
     * @param packageName The name of the package to retrieve the hidden status of.
     * @return boolean {@code true} if the package is hidden, {@code false} otherwise.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device or profile owner or if called on
     *            the parent profile and the {@code admin} is not a profile owner of an
     *            organization-owned managed profile.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if called on the parent profile and the package provided
     *            is not a system package.
