         * Add a network route to the VPN interface. Both IPv4 and IPv6
         * routes are supported.
         *
         * Adding a route implicitly allows traffic from that address family
         * (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6) to be routed over the VPN. @see #allowFamily
         *
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the route is invalid.
