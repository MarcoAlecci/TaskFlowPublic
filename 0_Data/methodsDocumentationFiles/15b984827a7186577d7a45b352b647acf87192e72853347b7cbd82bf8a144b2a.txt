         * Sets the size (in bits) of the key to be generated. For instance, for RSA keys this sets
         * the modulus size, for EC keys this selects a curve with a matching field size, and for
         * symmetric keys this sets the size of the bitstring which is their key material.
         *
         * <p>The default key size is specific to each key algorithm. If key size is not set
         * via this method, it should be looked up from the algorithm-specific parameters (if any)
         * provided via
         * {@link #setAlgorithmParameterSpec(AlgorithmParameterSpec) setAlgorithmParameterSpec}.
