     * Exit the keyguard securely.  The use case for this api is that, after
     * disabling the keyguard, your app, which was granted permission to
     * disable the keyguard and show a limited amount of information deemed
     * safe without the user getting past the keyguard, needs to navigate to
     * something that is not safe to view without getting past the keyguard.
     *
     * This will, if the keyguard is secure, bring up the unlock screen of
     * the keyguard.
     *
     * @param callback Lets you know whether the operation was successful and
     *   it is safe to launch anything that would normally be considered safe
     *   once the user has gotten past the keyguard.

     * @deprecated Use {@link LayoutParams#FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD}
     *   and/or {@link LayoutParams#FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED}
     *   instead; this allows you to seamlessly hide the keyguard as your application
     *   moves in and out of the foreground and does not require that any special
     *   permissions be requested.
