     * This only makes sense for action modes that support dynamic positioning on the screen.
     * If this method is called again before the hide duration expires, the later hide call will
     * cancel the former and then take effect.
     * NOTE that there is an internal limit to how long the mode can be hidden for. It's typically
     * about a few seconds.
