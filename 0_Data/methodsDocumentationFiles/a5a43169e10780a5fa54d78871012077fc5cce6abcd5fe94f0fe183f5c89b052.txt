     * <p>Start editing the pixels in the surface.  The returned Canvas can be used
     * to draw into the surface's bitmap.  A null is returned if the surface has
     * not been created or otherwise cannot be edited. You will usually need
     * to implement
     * {@link SurfaceTextureListener#onSurfaceTextureAvailable(android.graphics.SurfaceTexture, int, int)}
     * to find out when the Surface is available for use.</p>
     *
     * <p>The content of the Surface is never preserved between unlockCanvas()
     * and lockCanvas(), for this reason, every pixel within the Surface area
     * must be written. The only exception to this rule is when a dirty
     * rectangle is specified, in which case, non-dirty pixels will be
     * preserved.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method can only be used if the underlying surface is not already
     * owned by another producer. For instance, if the TextureView is being used
     * to render the camera's preview you cannot invoke this method.</p>

     * @return A Canvas used to draw into the surface, or null if the surface cannot be locked for
