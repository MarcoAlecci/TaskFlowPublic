     * Compute the interesting insets into your UI.  The default implementation
     * uses the top of the candidates frame for the visible insets, and the
     * top of the input frame for the content insets.  The default touchable
     * insets are {@link Insets#TOUCHABLE_INSETS_VISIBLE}.
     * 
     * <p>Note that this method is not called when
     * {@link #isExtractViewShown} returns true, since
     * in that case the application is left as-is behind the input method and
     * not impacted by anything in its UI.
     * 
     * @param outInsets Fill in with the current UI insets.
