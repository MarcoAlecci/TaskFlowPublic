     * Examine the given template and normalize if it refers to a "merged"
     * mobile subscriber. We pick the "lowest" merged subscriber as the primary
     * for key purposes, and expand the template to match all other merged
     * subscribers.
     * <p>
     * For example, given an incoming template matching B, and the currently
     * active merge set [A,B], we'd return a new template that primarily matches
     * A, but also matches B.
     * TODO: remove and use {@link #normalize(NetworkTemplate, List)}.
