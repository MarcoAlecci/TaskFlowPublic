     * The child class of the service can call this method to initiate a new Autofill flow. If all
     * conditions are met, it will make a request to the client app process to explicitly cancel
     * the current autofill session and create a new session. For example, an augmented autofill
     * service may notice some events which make it think a good time to provide updated
     * augmented autofill suggestions.
     *
     * <p> The request would be respected only if the previous augmented autofill request was
     * made for the same {@code activityComponent} and {@code autofillId}, and the field is
     * currently on focus.
     *
     * <p> The request would cancel the current session and start a new autofill flow.
     * It doesn't guarantee that the {@link AutofillManager} will proceed with the request.
     *
     * @param activityComponent the client component for which the autofill is requested for
     * @param autofillId        the client field id for which the autofill is requested for
     * @return true if the request makes the {@link AutofillManager} start a new Autofill flow,
     * false otherwise.
