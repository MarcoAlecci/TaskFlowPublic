     * <p>Two sizes are equal if and only if both their widths and heights are the same.</p>
     *
     * <p>For this purpose, the width/height float values are considered to be the same if and only
     * if the method {@link Float#floatToIntBits(float)} returns the identical {@code int} value
     * when applied to each.</p>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the objects were equal, {@code false} otherwise
