     * Indicates whether this View is currently in edit mode. A View is usually
     * in edit mode when displayed within a developer tool. For instance, if
     * this View is being drawn by a visual user interface builder, this method
     * should return true.
     *
     * Subclasses should check the return value of this method to provide
     * different behaviors if their normal behavior might interfere with the
     * host environment. For instance: the class spawns a thread in its
     * constructor, the drawing code relies on device-specific features, etc.
     *
     * This method is usually checked in the drawing code of custom widgets.
     *
     * @return True if this View is in edit mode, false otherwise.
