     * Removes an account directly. Normally used by authenticators, not
     * directly by applications. Does not delete the account from the server.
     * The authenticator may have its own policies preventing account deletion,
     * in which case the account will not be deleted.
     * <p>
     * It is safe to call this method from the main thread.
     * <p>This method requires the caller to have a signature match with the
     * authenticator that manages the specified account.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If targeting your app to work on API level 22 and before,
     * AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS permission and same UID as account's authenticator
     * is needed for those platforms. See docs for this function in API level 22.
     *
     * @param account The {@link Account} to delete.
     * @return True if the account was successfully deleted, false if the
     *         account did not exist, the account is null, or another error
     *         occurs.
