         * Set the estimated size of network traffic that will be performed by
         * this job, in bytes.
         * <p>
         * Apps are encouraged to provide values that are as accurate as
         * possible, but when the exact size isn't available, an
         * order-of-magnitude estimate can be provided instead. Here are some
         * specific examples:
         * <ul>
         * <li>A job that is backing up a photo knows the exact size of that
         * photo, so it should provide that size as the estimate.
         * <li>A job that refreshes top news stories wouldn't know an exact
         * size, but if the size is expected to be consistently around 100KB, it
         * can provide that order-of-magnitude value as the estimate.
         * <li>A job that synchronizes email could end up using an extreme range
         * of data, from under 1KB when nothing has changed, to dozens of MB
         * when there are new emails with attachments. Jobs that cannot provide
         * reasonable estimates should use the sentinel value
         * {@link JobInfo#NETWORK_BYTES_UNKNOWN}.
         * </ul>
         * Note that the system may choose to delay jobs with large network
         * usage estimates when the device has a poor network connection, in
         * order to save battery.
         * <p>
         * The values provided here only reflect the traffic that will be
         * performed by the base job; if you're using {@link JobWorkItem} then
         * you also need to define the network traffic used by each work item
         * when constructing them.
