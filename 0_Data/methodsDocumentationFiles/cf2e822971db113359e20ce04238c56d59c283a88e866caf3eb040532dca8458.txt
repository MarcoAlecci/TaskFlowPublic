     * Perform the operation associated with this PendingIntent, allowing the
     * caller to specify information about the Intent to use and be notified
     * when the send has completed.
     *
     * <p>For the intent parameter, a PendingIntent
     * often has restrictions on which fields can be supplied here, based on
     * how the PendingIntent was retrieved in {@link #getActivity},
     * {@link #getBroadcast}, or {@link #getService}.
     *
     * @param context The Context of the caller.  This may be null if
     * <var>intent</var> is also null.
     * @param code Result code to supply back to the PendingIntent's target.
     * @param intent Additional Intent data.  See {@link Intent#fillIn
     * Intent.fillIn()} for information on how this is applied to the
     * original Intent.  Use null to not modify the original Intent.
     * If flag {@link #FLAG_IMMUTABLE} was set when this pending intent was
     * created, this argument will be ignored.
     * @param onFinished The object to call back on when the send has
     * completed, or null for no callback.
     * @param handler Handler identifying the thread on which the callback
     * should happen.  If null, the callback will happen from the thread
     * pool of the process.
     * @param requiredPermission Name of permission that a recipient of the PendingIntent
     * is required to hold.  This is only valid for broadcast intents, and
     * corresponds to the permission argument in
     * {@link Context#sendBroadcast(Intent, String) Context.sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)}.
     * If null, no permission is required.
     * @param options Additional options the caller would like to provide to modify the sending
     * behavior.  May be built from an {@link ActivityOptions} to apply to an activity start.
