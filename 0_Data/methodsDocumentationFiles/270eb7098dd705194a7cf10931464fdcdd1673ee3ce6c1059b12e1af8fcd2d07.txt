     * This method prepares (initialises) the Secure Element for communication
     * before the Session object is returned (e.g. powers the Secure Element by
     * ICC ON if its not already on). There might be multiple sessions opened at
     * the same time on the same reader. The system ensures the interleaving of
     * APDUs between the respective sessions.
