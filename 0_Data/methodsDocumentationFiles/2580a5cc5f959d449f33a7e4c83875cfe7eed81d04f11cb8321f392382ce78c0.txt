     * A specific carrier ID returns the fine-grained carrier ID of the current subscription.
     * It can represent the fact that a carrier may be in effect an aggregation of other carriers
     * (ie in an MVNO type scenario) where each of these specific carriers which are used to make
     * up the actual carrier service may have different carrier configurations.
     * A specific carrier ID could also be used, for example, in a scenario where a carrier requires
     * different carrier configuration for different service offering such as a prepaid plan.
