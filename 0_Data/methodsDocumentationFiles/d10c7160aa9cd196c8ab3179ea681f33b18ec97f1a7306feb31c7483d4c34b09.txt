     * that a sighted user can interact with, as opposed to all windows.
     * For example, if there is a modal dialog shown and the user cannot touch
     * anything behind it, then only the modal window will be reported
     * (assuming it is the top one). For convenience the returned windows
     * are ordered in a descending layer order, which is the windows that
     * are higher in the Z-order are reported first.

     * <strong>Note:</strong> In order to access the windows you have to opt-in
     * to retrieve the interactive windows by setting the
     * {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#FLAG_RETRIEVE_INTERACTIVE_WINDOWS} flag.
