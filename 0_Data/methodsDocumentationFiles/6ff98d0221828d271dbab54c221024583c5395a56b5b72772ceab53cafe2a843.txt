     * Gets the text of this node.
     * <p>
     *   <strong>Note:</strong> If the text contains {@link ClickableSpan}s or {@link URLSpan}s,
     *   these spans will have been replaced with ones whose {@link ClickableSpan#onClick(View)}
     *   can be called from an {@link AccessibilityService}. When called from a service, the
     *   {@link View} argument is ignored and the corresponding span will be found on the view that
     *   this {@code AccessibilityNodeInfo} represents and called with that view as its argument.
     *   <p>
     *   This treatment of {@link ClickableSpan}s means that the text returned from this method may
     *   different slightly one passed to {@link #setText(CharSequence)}, although they will be
     *   equivalent according to {@link TextUtils#equals(CharSequence, CharSequence)}. The
     *   {@link ClickableSpan#onClick(View)} of any spans, however, will generally not work outside
     *   of an accessibility service.

     * @return The text.
