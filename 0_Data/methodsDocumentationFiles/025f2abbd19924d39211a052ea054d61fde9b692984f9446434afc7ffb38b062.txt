     * Called by a profile owner or device owner to set a default activity that the system selects
     * to handle intents that match the given {@link IntentFilter}. This activity will remain the
     * default intent handler even if the set of potential event handlers for the intent filter
     * changes and if the intent preferences are reset.
     * <p>
     * Note that the caller should still declare the activity in the manifest, the API just sets
     * the activity to be the default one to handle the given intent filter.
     * <p>
     * The default disambiguation mechanism takes over if the activity is not installed (anymore).
     * When the activity is (re)installed, it is automatically reset as default intent handler for
     * the filter.
     * <p>
     * The calling device admin must be a profile owner or device owner. If it is not, a security
     * exception will be thrown.
     *
     * <p>NOTE: Performs disk I/O and shouldn't be called on the main thread.
     *
