     * Blend between two CIE-LAB colors using the given ratio.
     *
     * <p>A blend ratio of 0.0 will result in {@code lab1}, 0.5 will give an even blend,
     * 1.0 will result in {@code lab2}.</p>
     *
     * @param lab1      3-element array which holds the first LAB color
     * @param lab2      3-element array which holds the second LAB color
     * @param ratio     the blend ratio of {@code lab1} to {@code lab2}
     * @param outResult 3-element array which holds the resulting LAB components
