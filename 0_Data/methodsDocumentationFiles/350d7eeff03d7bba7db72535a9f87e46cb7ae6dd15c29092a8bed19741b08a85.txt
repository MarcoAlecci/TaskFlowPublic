     * Return the ViewHolder for the item in the given position of the data set. Unlike
     * {@link #findViewHolderForLayoutPosition(int)} this method takes into account any pending
     * adapter changes that may not be reflected to the layout yet. On the other hand, if
     * {@link Adapter#notifyDataSetChanged()} has been called but the new layout has not been
     * calculated yet, this method will return <code>null</code> since the new positions of views
     * are unknown until the layout is calculated.
     * <p>
     * This method checks only the children of RecyclerView. If the item at the given
     * <code>position</code> is not laid out, it <em>will not</em> create a new one.
     * <p>
     * When the ItemAnimator is running a change animation, there might be 2 ViewHolders
     * representing the same Item. In this case, the updated ViewHolder will be returned.
     *
     * @param position The position of the item in the data set of the adapter
     * @return The ViewHolder at <code>position</code> or null if there is no such item
