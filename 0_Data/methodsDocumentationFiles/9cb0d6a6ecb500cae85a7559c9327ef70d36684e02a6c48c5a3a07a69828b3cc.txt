     * <p>Sets the distance along the Z axis (orthogonal to the X/Y plane on which
     * RenderNodes are drawn) from the camera to this RenderNode. The camera's distance
     * affects 3D transformations, for instance rotations around the X and Y
     * axis. If the rotationX or rotationY properties are changed and this view is
     * large (more than half the size of the screen), it is recommended to always
     * use a camera distance that's greater than the height (X axis rotation) or
     * the width (Y axis rotation) of this view.</p>
     *
     * <p>The distance of the camera from the drawing plane can have an affect on the
     * perspective distortion of the RenderNode when it is rotated around the x or y axis.
     * For example, a large distance will result in a large viewing angle, and there
     * will not be much perspective distortion of the view as it rotates. A short
     * distance may cause much more perspective distortion upon rotation, and can
     * also result in some drawing artifacts if the rotated view ends up partially
     * behind the camera (which is why the recommendation is to use a distance at
     * least as far as the size of the view, if the view is to be rotated.)</p>
     *
     * <p>The distance is expressed in pixels and must always be positive</p>
