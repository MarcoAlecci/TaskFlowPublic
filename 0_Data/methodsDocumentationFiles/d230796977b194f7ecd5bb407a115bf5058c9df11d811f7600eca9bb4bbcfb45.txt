     * Schedules the playback of a clip.
     * This will automatically update the mute flags in sync with the JET Clip Marker (controller 
     * 103). The parameter clipID must be in the range of 0-63. After the call to triggerClip, when
     * JET next encounters a controller event 103 with bits 0-5 of the value equal to clipID and 
     * bit 6 set to 1, it will automatically unmute the track containing the controller event.
     * When JET encounters the complementary controller event 103 with bits 0-5 of the value equal
     * to clipID and bit 6 set to 0, it will mute the track again.
     * @param clipId the identifier of the clip to trigger.
     * @return true if the clip was successfully triggered, false otherwise.
