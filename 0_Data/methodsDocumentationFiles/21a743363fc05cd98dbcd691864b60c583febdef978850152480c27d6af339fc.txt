     * Request or lock audio focus.
     * This method is to be used by system components that have registered an
     * {@link android.media.audiopolicy.AudioPolicy} to request audio focus, but also to "lock" it
     * so focus granting is temporarily disabled.
     * @param afr see the description of the same parameter in
     *     {@link #requestAudioFocus(AudioFocusRequest)}
     * @param ap a registered {@link android.media.audiopolicy.AudioPolicy} instance when locking
     *     focus, or null.
     * @return {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_FAILED}, {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_GRANTED}
     *     or {@link #AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_DELAYED}.
     * @throws NullPointerException if the AudioFocusRequest is null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException when trying to lock focus without an AudioPolicy
