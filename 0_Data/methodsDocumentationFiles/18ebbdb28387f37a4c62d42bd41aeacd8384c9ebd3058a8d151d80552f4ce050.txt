     * Higher-level method for sending both the down and up key events for a
     * particular character key code.  Equivalent to creating both KeyEvent
     * objects by hand and calling {@link #sendKeySync}.  The event appears
     * as if it came from keyboard 0, the built in one.
     * 
     * @param keyCode The key code of the character to send.
