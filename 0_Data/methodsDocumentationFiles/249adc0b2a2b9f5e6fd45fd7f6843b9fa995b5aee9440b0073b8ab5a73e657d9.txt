         * Sets the value of a field, using a custom {@link RemoteViews presentation} to
         * visualize it.
         *
         * <p><b>Note:</b> On Android {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} and
         * higher, datasets that require authentication can be also be filtered by passing a
         * {@link AutofillValue#forText(CharSequence) text value} as the  {@code value} parameter.
         *
         * <p>Theme does not work with RemoteViews layout. Avoid hardcoded text color
         * or background color: Autofill on different platforms may have different themes.

         * @param id id returned by {@link
         *         android.app.assist.AssistStructure.ViewNode#getAutofillId()}.
         * @param value the value to be autofilled. Pass {@code null} if you do not have the value
         *        but the target view is a logical part of the dataset. For example, if
         *        the dataset needs authentication and you have no access to the value.
         * @param presentation the presentation used to visualize this field.
         *
