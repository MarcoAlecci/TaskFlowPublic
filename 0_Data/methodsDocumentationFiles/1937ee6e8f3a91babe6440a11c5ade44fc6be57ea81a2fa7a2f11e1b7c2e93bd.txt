     * <p> If this socket has an associated channel then the resulting output
     * stream delegates all of its operations to the channel.  If the channel
     * is in non-blocking mode then the output stream's {@code write}
     * operations will throw an {@link
     * java.nio.channels.IllegalBlockingModeException}.
     *
     * <p> Closing the returned {@link java.io.OutputStream OutputStream}
     * will close the associated socket.
     *
     * @return     an output stream for writing bytes to this socket.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs when creating the
     *               output stream or if the socket is not connected.
