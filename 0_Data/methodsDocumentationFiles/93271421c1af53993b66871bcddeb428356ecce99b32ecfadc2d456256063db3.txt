     * Called when the view previously created by {@link #onCreateView} has
     * been detached from the fragment.  The next time the fragment needs
     * to be displayed, a new view will be created.  This is called
     * after {@link #onStop()} and before {@link #onDestroy()}.  It is called
     * <em>regardless</em> of whether {@link #onCreateView} returned a
     * non-null view.  Internally it is called after the view's state has
     * been saved but before it has been removed from its parent.
