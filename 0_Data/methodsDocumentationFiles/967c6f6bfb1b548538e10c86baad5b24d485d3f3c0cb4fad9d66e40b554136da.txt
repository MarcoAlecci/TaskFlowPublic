     * Request a network to satisfy a set of {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities}.
     *
     * This method behaves identically to {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)}
     * but runs all the callbacks on the passed Handler.
     *
     * <p>This method has the same permission requirements as
     * {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)}, is subject to the same limitations,
     * and throws the same exceptions in the same conditions.
     *
     * @param request {@link NetworkRequest} describing this request.
     * @param networkCallback The {@link NetworkCallback} to be utilized for this request. Note
     *                        the callback must not be shared - it uniquely specifies this request.
     * @param handler {@link Handler} to specify the thread upon which the callback will be invoked.
