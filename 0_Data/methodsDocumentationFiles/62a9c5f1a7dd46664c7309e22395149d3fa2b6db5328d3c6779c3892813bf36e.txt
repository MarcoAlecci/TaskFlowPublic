     * (Usually optional) Set the data for the intent along with an explicit
     * MIME data type.  This method should very rarely be used -- it allows you
     * to override the MIME type that would ordinarily be inferred from the
     * data with your own type given here.
     *
     * <p><em>Note: MIME type and Uri scheme matching in the
     * Android framework is case-sensitive, unlike the formal RFC definitions.
     * As a result, you should always write these elements with lower case letters,
     * or use {@link #normalizeMimeType} or {@link android.net.Uri#normalizeScheme} or
     * {@link #setDataAndTypeAndNormalize}
     * to ensure that they are converted to lower case.</em>
     *
     * @param data The Uri of the data this intent is now targeting.
     * @param type The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.
     *
     * @return Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls
     * into a single statement.
