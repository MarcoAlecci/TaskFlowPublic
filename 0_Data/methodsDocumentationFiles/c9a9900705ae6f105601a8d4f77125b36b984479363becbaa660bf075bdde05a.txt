     * Transposes a 4 x 4 matrix.
     * <p>
     * mTrans and m must not overlap.
     *
     * @param mTrans the array that holds the output transposed matrix
     * @param mTransOffset an offset into mTrans where the transposed matrix is
     *        stored.
     * @param m the input array
     * @param mOffset an offset into m where the input matrix is stored.
