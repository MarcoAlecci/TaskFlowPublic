     * Check whether the app with the given pid/uid can read phone state, or has carrier
     * privileges on any active subscription.
     *
     * <p>If the app does not have carrier privilege, this method will return {@code false} instead
     * of throwing a SecurityException. Therefore, the callers cannot tell the difference
     * between M+ apps which declare the runtime permission but do not have it, and pre-M apps
     * which declare the static permission but had access revoked via AppOps. Apps in the former
     * category expect SecurityExceptions; apps in the latter don't. So this method is suitable for
     * use only if the behavior in both scenarios is meant to be identical.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the app can read phone state or has carrier privilege;
     *         {@code false} otherwise.
