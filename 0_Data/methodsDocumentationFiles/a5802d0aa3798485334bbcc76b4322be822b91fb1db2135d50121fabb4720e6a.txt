     * Get the estimated vertical accuracy of this location, in meters.
     *
     * <p>We define vertical accuracy at 68% confidence.  Specifically, as 1-side of the
     * 2-sided range above and below the estimated altitude reported by {@link #getAltitude()},
     * within which there is a 68% probability of finding the true altitude.
     *
     * <p>In the case where the underlying distribution is assumed Gaussian normal, this would be
     * considered 1 standard deviation.
     *
     * <p>For example, if {@link #getAltitude()} returns 150, and
     * {@link #getVerticalAccuracyMeters()} returns 20 then there is a 68% probability
     * of the true altitude being between 130 and 170 meters.
     *
     * <p>If this location does not have a vertical accuracy, then 0.0 is returned.
