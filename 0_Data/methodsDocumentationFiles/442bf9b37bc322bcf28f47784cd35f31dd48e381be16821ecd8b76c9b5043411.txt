     * Add a finisher-runnable to wait for {@link #queue asynchronously processed work}.
     *
     * Used by SharedPreferences$Editor#startCommit().
     *
     * Note that this doesn't actually start it running.  This is just a scratch set for callers
     * doing async work to keep updated with what's in-flight. In the common case, caller code
     * (e.g. SharedPreferences) will pretty quickly call remove() after an add(). The only time
     * these Runnables are run is from {@link #waitToFinish}.
     *
     * @param finisher The runnable to add as finisher
