     * Called by a device owner, or alternatively a profile owner from Android 8.0 (API level 26) or
     * higher, to set whether auto time is required. If auto time is required, no user will be able
     * set the date and time and network date and time will be used.
     * <p>
     * Note: if auto time is required the user can still manually set the time zone.

     * The calling device admin must be a device owner, or alternatively a profile owner from
     * Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher. If it is not, a security exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * Staring from Android 11, this API switches to use
     * {@link UserManager#DISALLOW_CONFIG_DATE_TIME} to enforce the auto time settings. Calling
     * this API to enforce auto time will result in
     * {@link UserManager#DISALLOW_CONFIG_DATE_TIME} being set, while calling this API to lift
     * the requirement will result in {@link UserManager#DISALLOW_CONFIG_DATE_TIME} being cleared.
     * From Android 11, this API can also no longer be called on a managed profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param required Whether auto time is set required or not.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device owner, not a profile owner or
     * if this API is called on a managed profile.
     * @deprecated From {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R}. Use {@link #setAutoTimeEnabled}
     * to turn auto time on or off and use {@link UserManager#DISALLOW_CONFIG_DATE_TIME}
     * to prevent the user from changing this setting.
