     * When smooth scrollbar is enabled, the position and size of the scrollbar thumb is computed
     * based on the number of visible pixels in the visible items. This however assumes that all
     * list items have similar or equal widths or heights (depending on list orientation).
     * If you use a list in which items have different dimensions, the scrollbar will change
     * appearance as the user scrolls through the list. To avoid this issue,  you need to disable
     * this property.
     *
     * When smooth scrollbar is disabled, the position and size of the scrollbar thumb is based
     * solely on the number of items in the adapter and the position of the visible items inside
     * the adapter. This provides a stable scrollbar as the user navigates through a list of items
     * with varying widths / heights.
     *
     * @param enabled Whether or not to enable smooth scrollbar.
