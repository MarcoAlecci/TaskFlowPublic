     * Given an IContentProvider, try to coerce it back to the real
     * ContentProvider object if it is running in the local process.  This can
     * be used if you know you are running in the same process as a provider,
     * and want to get direct access to its implementation details.  Most
     * clients should not nor have a reason to use it.
     *
     * @param abstractInterface The ContentProvider interface that is to be
     *              coerced.
     * @return If the IContentProvider is non-{@code null} and local, returns its actual
     * ContentProvider instance.  Otherwise returns {@code null}.
