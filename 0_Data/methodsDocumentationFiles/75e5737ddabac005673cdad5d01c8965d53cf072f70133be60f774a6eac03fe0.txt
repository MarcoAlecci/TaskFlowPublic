     * This is called when a child activity of this one calls its
     * {@link #navigateUpTo} method.  The default implementation simply calls
     * navigateUpTo(upIntent) on this activity (the parent).
     *
     * @param child The activity making the call.
     * @param upIntent An intent representing the target destination for up navigation
     *
     * @return true if up navigation successfully reached the activity indicated by upIntent and
     *         upIntent was delivered to it. false if an instance of the indicated activity could
     *         not be found and this activity was simply finished normally.
     * @deprecated Use {@link #navigateUpTo(Intent)} instead.
