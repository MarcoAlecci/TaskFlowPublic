     * <p>Marshalers are looked up in the order they were registered; earlier registered
     * marshal queriers get priority.</p>
     *
     * @param typeToken The compile-time type reference for {@code T}
     * @param nativeType The native type, e.g. {@link CameraMetadataNative#TYPE_BYTE TYPE_BYTE}
     * @return marshaler a non-{@code null} marshaler that supports marshaling the type combo
