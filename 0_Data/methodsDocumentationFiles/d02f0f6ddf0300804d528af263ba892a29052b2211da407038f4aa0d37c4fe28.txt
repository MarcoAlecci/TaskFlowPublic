         * Sends the type and ID of a selected track. This is used to inform the application that a
         * specific track is selected. The TV input service must call this method as soon as a track
         * is selected either by default or in response to a call to {@link #onSelectTrack}. The
         * selected track ID for a given type is maintained in the framework until the next call to
         * this method even after the entire track list is updated (but is reset when the session is
         * tuned to a new channel), so care must be taken not to result in an obsolete track ID.
         *
         * @param type The type of the selected track. The type can be
         *            {@link TvTrackInfo#TYPE_AUDIO}, {@link TvTrackInfo#TYPE_VIDEO} or
         *            {@link TvTrackInfo#TYPE_SUBTITLE}.
         * @param trackId The ID of the selected track.
         * @see #onSelectTrack
