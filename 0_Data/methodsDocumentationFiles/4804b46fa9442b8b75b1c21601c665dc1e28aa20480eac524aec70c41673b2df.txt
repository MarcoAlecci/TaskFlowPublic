     * Returns a stream of code point values from this sequence.  Any surrogate
     * pairs encountered in the sequence are combined as if by {@linkplain
     * Character#toCodePoint Character.toCodePoint} and the result is passed
     * to the stream. Any other code units, including ordinary BMP characters,
     * unpaired surrogates, and undefined code units, are zero-extended to
     * {@code int} values which are then passed to the stream.
     *
     * <p>If the sequence is mutated while the stream is being read, the result
     * is undefined.
