     * A convenience method to set the owner's read permission for this abstract
     * pathname.
     *
     * <p>An invocation of this method of the form <tt>file.setReadable(arg)</tt>
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
     *
     * <pre>
     *     file.setReadable(arg, true) </pre>
     *
     * @param  readable
     *          If <code>true</code>, sets the access permission to allow read
     *          operations; if <code>false</code> to disallow read operations
     *
     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the operation succeeded.  The
     *          operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
     *          change the access permissions of this abstract pathname.  If
     *          <code>readable</code> is <code>false</code> and the underlying
     *          file system does not implement a read permission, then the
     *          operation will fail.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies write access to the file
