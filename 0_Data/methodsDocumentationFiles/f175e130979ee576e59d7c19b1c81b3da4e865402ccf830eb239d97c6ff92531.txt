     * Compares this buffer to another.
     *
     * <p> Two double buffers are compared by comparing their sequences of
     * remaining elements lexicographically, without regard to the starting
     * position of each sequence within its corresponding buffer.

     * Pairs of {@code double} elements are compared as if by invoking
     * {@link Double#compare(double,double)}, except that
     * {@code -0.0} and {@code 0.0} are considered to be equal.
     * {@code Double.NaN} is considered by this method to be equal
     * to itself and greater than all other {@code double} values
     * (including {@code Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY}).

     *
     * <p> A double buffer is not comparable to any other type of object.
     *
     * @return  A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this buffer
     *          is less than, equal to, or greater than the given buffer
