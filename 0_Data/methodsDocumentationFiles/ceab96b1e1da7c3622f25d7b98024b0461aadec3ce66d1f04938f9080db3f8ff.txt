     * Start a new process.
     * 
     * <p>If processes are enabled, a new process is created and the
     * static main() function of a <var>processClass</var> is executed there.
     * The process will continue running after this function returns.
     * 
     * <p>If processes are not enabled, a new thread in the caller's
     * process is created and main() of <var>processClass</var> called there.
     * 
     * <p>The niceName parameter, if not an empty string, is a custom name to
     * give to the process instead of using processClass.  This allows you to
     * make easily identifyable processes even if you are using the same base
     * <var>processClass</var> to start them.
     * 
     * When invokeWith is not null, the process will be started as a fresh app
     * and not a zygote fork. Note that this is only allowed for uid 0 or when
     * runtimeFlags contains DEBUG_ENABLE_DEBUGGER.
     *
     * @param processClass The class to use as the process's main entry
     *                     point.
     * @param niceName A more readable name to use for the process.
     * @param uid The user-id under which the process will run.
     * @param gid The group-id under which the process will run.
     * @param gids Additional group-ids associated with the process.
     * @param runtimeFlags Additional flags for the runtime.
     * @param targetSdkVersion The target SDK version for the app.
     * @param seInfo null-ok SELinux information for the new process.
     * @param abi non-null the ABI this app should be started with.
     * @param instructionSet null-ok the instruction set to use.
     * @param appDataDir null-ok the data directory of the app.
     * @param invokeWith null-ok the command to invoke with.
     * @param packageName null-ok the name of the package this process belongs to.
     * @param zygotePolicyFlags Flags used to determine how to launch the application
     * @param isTopApp whether the process starts for high priority application.
     * @param disabledCompatChanges null-ok list of disabled compat changes for the process being
     *                             started.
     * @param pkgDataInfoMap Map from related package names to private data directory
     *                       volume UUID and inode number.
     * @param whitelistedDataInfoMap Map from whitelisted package names to private data directory
     *                       volume UUID and inode number.
     * @param bindMountAppsData whether zygote needs to mount CE and DE data.
     * @param bindMountAppStorageDirs whether zygote needs to mount Android/obb and Android/data.
     * @param zygoteArgs Additional arguments to supply to the zygote process.
     * @return An object that describes the result of the attempt to start the process.
     * @throws RuntimeException on fatal start failure
