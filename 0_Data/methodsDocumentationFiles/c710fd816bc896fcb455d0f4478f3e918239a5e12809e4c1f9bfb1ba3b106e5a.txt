     * <p>A finite number is defined to be both representable (that is, not NaN) and
     * not infinite (that is neither positive or negative infinity).</p>

     * @param value a floating point value
     * @param valueName the name of the argument to use if the check fails
     *
     * @return the validated floating point value
