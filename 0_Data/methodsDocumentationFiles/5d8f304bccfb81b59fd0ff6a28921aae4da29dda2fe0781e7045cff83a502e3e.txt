     * Allows this receiver to select the alias for a private key and certificate pair for
     * authentication.  If this method returns null, the default {@link android.app.Activity} will
     * be shown that lets the user pick a private key and certificate pair.
     * If this method returns {@link KeyChain#KEY_ALIAS_SELECTION_DENIED},
     * the default {@link android.app.Activity} will not be shown and the user will not be allowed
     * to pick anything. And the app, that called {@link KeyChain#choosePrivateKeyAlias}, will
     * receive {@code null} back.
     *
     * <p> This callback is only applicable if the delegated app has
     * {@link DevicePolicyManager#DELEGATION_CERT_SELECTION} capability. Additionally, it must
     * declare an intent filter for {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#ACTION_CHOOSE_PRIVATE_KEY_ALIAS}
     * in the receiver's manifest in order to receive this callback. The default implementation
     * simply throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
