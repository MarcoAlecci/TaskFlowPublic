     * after a reboot. Use {@link java.util.TimeZone#setDefault} if you just want to change the
     * time zone within your app, and even then prefer to pass an explicit
     * {@link java.util.TimeZone} to APIs that require it rather than changing the time zone for
     * all threads.

     * <p> On android M and above, it is an error to pass in a non-Olson timezone to this
     * function. Note that this is a bad idea on all Android releases because POSIX and
     * the {@code TimeZone} class have opposite interpretations of {@code '+'} and {@code '-'}
     * in the same non-Olson ID.

     * @param timeZone one of the Olson ids from the list returned by
     *     {@link java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs}
