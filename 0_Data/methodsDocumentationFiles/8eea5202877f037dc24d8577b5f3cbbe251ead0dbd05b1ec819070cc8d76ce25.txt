     * Obtains an instance of {@code LocalDateTime} using seconds from the
     * epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
     * <p>
     * This allows the {@link ChronoField#INSTANT_SECONDS epoch-second} field
     * to be converted to a local date-time. This is primarily intended for
     * low-level conversions rather than general application usage.
     *
     * @param epochSecond  the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

     * @param offset  the zone offset, not null
     * @return the local date-time, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported range,
