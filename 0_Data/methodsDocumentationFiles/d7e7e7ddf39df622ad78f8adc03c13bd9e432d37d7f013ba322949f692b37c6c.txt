     * Open and return the requested document.
     * <p>
     * Your provider should return a reliable {@link ParcelFileDescriptor} to
     * detect when the remote caller has finished reading or writing the
     * document.
     * <p>
     * Mode "r" should always be supported. Provider should throw
     * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} if the passing mode is not supported.
     * You may return a pipe or socket pair if the mode is exclusively "r" or
     * "w", but complex modes like "rw" imply a normal file on disk that
     * supports seeking.
     * <p>
     * If you block while downloading content, you should periodically check
     * {@link CancellationSignal#isCanceled()} to abort abandoned open requests.
     *
     * @param documentId the document to return.
     * @param mode the mode to open with, such as 'r', 'w', or 'rw'.
     * @param signal used by the caller to signal if the request should be
     *            cancelled. May be null.
     * @throws AuthenticationRequiredException If authentication is required from
     *            the user (such as login credentials), but it is not guaranteed
     *            that the client will handle this properly.
