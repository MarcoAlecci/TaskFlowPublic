     * Called by a profile owner or device owner to grant access to privileged APIs to another app.
     * Granted APIs are determined by {@code scopes}, which is a list of the {@code DELEGATION_*}
     * constants.
     * <p>
     * A broadcast with the {@link #ACTION_APPLICATION_DELEGATION_SCOPES_CHANGED} action will be
     * sent to the {@code delegatePackage} with its new scopes in an {@code ArrayList<String>} extra
     * under the {@link #EXTRA_DELEGATION_SCOPES} key. The broadcast is sent with the
     * {@link Intent#FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY} flag.
     * <p>
     * Delegated scopes are a per-user state. The delegated access is persistent until it is later
     * cleared by calling this method with an empty {@code scopes} list or uninstalling the
     * {@code delegatePackage}.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param delegatePackage The package name of the app which will be given access.
     * @param scopes The groups of privileged APIs whose access should be granted to
     *            {@code delegatedPackage}.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device or a profile owner.
