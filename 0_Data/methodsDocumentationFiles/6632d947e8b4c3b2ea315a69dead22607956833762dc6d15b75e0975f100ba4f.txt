     * Determine if any of the provided authenticators can be used. In other words, determine if
     * {@link BiometricPrompt} can be expected to be shown (hardware available, templates enrolled,
     * user-enabled).
     *
     * For biometric authenticators, determine if the device can currently authenticate with at
     * least the requested strength. For example, invoking this API with
     * {@link Authenticators#BIOMETRIC_WEAK} on a device that currently only has
     * {@link Authenticators#BIOMETRIC_STRONG} enrolled will return {@link #BIOMETRIC_SUCCESS}.
     *
     * Invoking this API with {@link Authenticators#DEVICE_CREDENTIAL} can be used to determine
     * if the user has a PIN/Pattern/Password set up.
     *
     * @param authenticators bit field consisting of constants defined in {@link Authenticators}.
     *                       If multiple authenticators are queried, a logical OR will be applied.
     *                       For example, if {@link Authenticators#DEVICE_CREDENTIAL} |
     *                       {@link Authenticators#BIOMETRIC_STRONG} is queried and only
     *                       {@link Authenticators#DEVICE_CREDENTIAL} is set up, this API will
     *                       return {@link #BIOMETRIC_SUCCESS}
     *
     * @return {@link #BIOMETRIC_ERROR_NONE_ENROLLED} if the user does not have any of the
     *     requested authenticators enrolled, or {@link #BIOMETRIC_ERROR_HW_UNAVAILABLE} if none are
     *     currently supported/enabled. Returns {@link #BIOMETRIC_SUCCESS} if one of the requested
     *     authenticators can currently be used (enrolled and available).
