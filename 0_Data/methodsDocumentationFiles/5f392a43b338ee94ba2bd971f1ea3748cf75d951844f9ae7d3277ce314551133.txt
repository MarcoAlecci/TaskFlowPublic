     * Specifies an action to take place when the next animation runs. If there is a
     * {@link #setStartDelay(long) startDelay} set on this ViewPropertyAnimator, then the
     * action will run after that startDelay expires, when the actual animation begins.
     * This method, along with {@link #withEndAction(Runnable)}, is intended to help facilitate
     * choreographing ViewPropertyAnimator animations with other animations or actions
     * in the application.
     *
     * @param runnable The action to run when the next animation starts.
     * @return This object, allowing calls to methods in this class to be chained.
