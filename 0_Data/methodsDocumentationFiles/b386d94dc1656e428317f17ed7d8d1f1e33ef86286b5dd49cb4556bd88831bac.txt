     * This method retrieves a still image by its index. It should only be called
     * after {@link #setDataSource}.
     *
     * After the bitmap is returned, you can query the actual parameters that were
     * used to create the bitmap from the {@code BitmapParams} argument, for instance
     * to query the bitmap config used for the bitmap with {@link BitmapParams#getActualConfig}.
     *
     * @param imageIndex 0-based index of the image.
     * @param params BitmapParams that controls the returned bitmap config (such as pixel formats).
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the container doesn't contain still images.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the requested image does not exist.
     *
     * @return the requested still image, or null if the image cannot be retrieved.
