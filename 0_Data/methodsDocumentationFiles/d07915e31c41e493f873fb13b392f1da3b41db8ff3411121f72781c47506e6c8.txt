     * Generic method for setting vendor-specific parameter values.
     * The framework does not interpret the parameters, they are passed
     * in an opaque manner between a vendor application and HAL.
     *
     * Framework does not make any assumptions on the keys or values, other than
     * ones stated in VendorKeyValue documentation (a requirement of key
     * prefixes).
     * See VendorKeyValue at hardware/interfaces/broadcastradio/2.0/types.hal.
     *
     * For each pair in the result map, the key will be one of the keys
     * contained in the input (possibly with wildcards expanded), and the value
     * will be a vendor-specific result status (such as "OK" or an error code).
     * The implementation may choose to return an empty map, or only return
     * a status for a subset of the provided inputs, at its discretion.
     *
     * Application and HAL must not use keys with unknown prefix. In particular,
     * it must not place a key-value pair in results vector for unknown key from
     * parameters vector - instead, an unknown key should simply be ignored.
     * In other words, results vector may contain a subset of parameter keys
     * (however, the framework doesn't enforce a strict subset - the only
     * formal requirement is vendor domain prefix for keys).
     *
     * @param parameters Vendor-specific key-value pairs.
     * @return Operation completion status for parameters being set.
