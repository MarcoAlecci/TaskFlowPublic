         * This method is called when the camera device has started capturing
         * the output image for the request, at the beginning of image exposure, or
         * when the camera device has started processing an input image for a reprocess
         * request.
         *
         * <p>For a regular capture request, this callback is invoked right as
         * the capture of a frame begins, so it is the most appropriate time
         * for playing a shutter sound, or triggering UI indicators of capture.</p>
         *
         * <p>The request that is being used for this capture is provided, along
         * with the actual timestamp for the start of exposure. For a reprocess
         * request, this timestamp will be the input image's start of exposure
         * which matches {@link CaptureResult#SENSOR_TIMESTAMP the result timestamp field}
         * of the {@link TotalCaptureResult} that was used to
         * {@link CameraDevice#createReprocessCaptureRequest create the reprocess request}.
         * This timestamp matches the timestamps that will be
         * included in {@link CaptureResult#SENSOR_TIMESTAMP the result timestamp field},
         * and in the buffers sent to each output Surface. These buffer
         * timestamps are accessible through, for example,
         * {@link android.media.Image#getTimestamp() Image.getTimestamp()} or
         * {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture#getTimestamp()}.
         * The frame number included is equal to the frame number that will be included in
         * {@link CaptureResult#getFrameNumber}.</p>
         *
         * <p>For the simplest way to play a shutter sound camera shutter or a
         * video recording start/stop sound, see the
         * {@link android.media.MediaActionSound} class.</p>
         *
         * <p>The default implementation of this method does nothing.</p>

         * @param session the session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
         * @param request the request for the capture that just begun
         * @param timestamp the timestamp at start of capture for a regular request, or
         *                  the timestamp at the input image's start of capture for a
         *                  reprocess request, in nanoseconds.
