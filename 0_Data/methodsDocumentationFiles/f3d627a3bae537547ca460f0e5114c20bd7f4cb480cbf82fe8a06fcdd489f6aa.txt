     * Initiate disconnection from a profile
     *
     * <p> This API will return false in scenarios like the profile on the
     * Bluetooth device is not in connected state etc. When this API returns,
     * true, it is guaranteed that the connection state change
     * intent will be broadcasted with the state. Users can get the
     * disconnection state of the profile from this intent.
     *
     * <p> If the disconnection is initiated by a remote device, the state
     * will transition from {@link #STATE_CONNECTED} to
     * {@link #STATE_DISCONNECTED}. If the disconnect is initiated by the
     * host (local) device the state will transition from
     * {@link #STATE_CONNECTED} to state {@link #STATE_DISCONNECTING} to
     * state {@link #STATE_DISCONNECTED}. The transition to
     * {@link #STATE_DISCONNECTING} can be used to distinguish between the
     * two scenarios.
