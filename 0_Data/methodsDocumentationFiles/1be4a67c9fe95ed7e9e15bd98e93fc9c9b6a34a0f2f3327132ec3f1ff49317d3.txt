     * Create a new blob identifier.
     *
     * <p> For two objects of {@link BlobHandle} to be considered equal, the following arguments
     * must be equal:
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@code digest}
     * <li> {@code label}
     * <li> {@code expiryTimeMillis}
     * <li> {@code tag}
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param digest the SHA-256 hash of the blob this is representing.
     * @param label a label indicating what the blob is, that can be surfaced to the user.
     *              The length of the label cannot be more than 100 characters. It is recommended
     *              to keep this brief. This may be truncated and ellipsized if it is too long
     *              to be displayed to the user.
     * @param expiryTimeMillis the time in secs after which the blob should be invalidated and not
     *                         allowed to be accessed by any other app,
     *                         in {@link System#currentTimeMillis()} timebase or {@code 0} to
     *                         indicate that there is no expiry time associated with this blob.
     * @param tag an opaque {@link String} associated with the blob. The length of the tag
     *            cannot be more than 128 characters.
     *
     * @return a new instance of {@link BlobHandle} object.
