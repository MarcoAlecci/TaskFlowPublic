     * Selects the class loader which will be used by the platform to instantiate app components.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation of this method returns the {@code cl} parameter unchanged.
     * Applications can override this method to set up a custom class loader or a custom class
     * loader hierarchy and return it to the platform.
     * <p>
     * The method is a hook invoked before any application components are instantiated or the
     * application Context is initialized. It is intended to allow the application's classes to
     * be loaded from a different source than the base/split APK(s).
     * <p>
     * The default class loader {@code cl} is created by the platform and used to load the
     * application's base or split APK(s). Its parent is typically the boot class loader, unless
     * running under instrumentation. Its classname is configurable using the
     * {@link android.R.attr#classLoader} manifest attribute.
     *
     * @param cl        The default class loader created by the platform.
     * @param aInfo     Information about the application being loaded.
