         * transmission temporarily.

         * <p>This generally means that while the TCP connections are still live temporarily
         * network data fails to transfer. To give a specific example, this is used on cellular
         * networks to mask temporary outages when driving through a tunnel, etc. In general this
         * means read operations on sockets on this network will block once the buffers are
         * drained, and write operations will block once the buffers are full.
         *
         * <p>Do NOT call {@link #getNetworkCapabilities(Network)} or
         * {@link #getLinkProperties(Network)} or other synchronous ConnectivityManager methods in
         * this callback as this is prone to race conditions (there is no guarantee the objects
         * returned by these methods will be current).
