     * Create a persistent input surface that can be used with codecs that normally have an input
     * surface, such as video encoders. A persistent input can be reused by subsequent
     * {@link MediaCodec} or {@link MediaRecorder} instances, but can only be used by at
     * most one codec or recorder instance concurrently.
     * <p>
     * The application is responsible for calling release() on the Surface when done.
     *
     * @return an input surface that can be used with {@link #setInputSurface}.
