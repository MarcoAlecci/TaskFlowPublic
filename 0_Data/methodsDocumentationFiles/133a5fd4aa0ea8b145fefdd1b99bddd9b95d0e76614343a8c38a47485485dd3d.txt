     * Note that the return value of this method only speaks of success
     * up to the point of sending this to the Context Hub.  It is not
     * an assurance that the Context Hub successfully sent this message
     * on to the nanoapp.  If assurance is desired, a protocol should be
     * established between your code and the nanoapp, with the nanoapp
     * sending a confirmation message (which will be reported via
     * Callback.onMessageReceipt).
