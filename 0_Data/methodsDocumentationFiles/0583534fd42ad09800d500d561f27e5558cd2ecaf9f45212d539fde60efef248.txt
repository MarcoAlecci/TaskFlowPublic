     * Select the default key handling for this activity.  This controls what
     * will happen to key events that are not otherwise handled.  The default
     * mode ({@link #DEFAULT_KEYS_DISABLE}) will simply drop them on the
     * floor. Other modes allow you to launch the dialer
     * ({@link #DEFAULT_KEYS_DIALER}), execute a shortcut in your options
     * menu without requiring the menu key be held down
     * ({@link #DEFAULT_KEYS_SHORTCUT}), or launch a search ({@link #DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_LOCAL}
     * and {@link #DEFAULT_KEYS_SEARCH_GLOBAL}).
     *
     * <p>Note that the mode selected here does not impact the default
     * handling of system keys, such as the "back" and "menu" keys, and your
     * activity and its views always get a first chance to receive and handle
     * all application keys.
     *
     * @param mode The desired default key mode constant.
