         * Calculates the bounding box of the View while taking into account its matrix changes
         * (translation, scale etc) with respect to the RecyclerView.
         * <p>
         * If {@code includeDecorInsets} is {@code true}, they are applied first before applying
         * the View's matrix so that the decor offsets also go through the same transformation.
         *
         * @param child The ItemView whose bounding box should be calculated.
         * @param includeDecorInsets True if the decor insets should be included in the bounding box
         * @param out The rectangle into which the output will be written.
