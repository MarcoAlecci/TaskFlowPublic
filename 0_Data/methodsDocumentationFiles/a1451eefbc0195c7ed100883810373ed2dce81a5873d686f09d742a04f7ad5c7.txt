     * Compare this package's specification version with a
     * desired version. It returns true if
     * this packages specification version number is greater than or equal
     * to the desired version number. <p>
     *
     * Version numbers are compared by sequentially comparing corresponding
     * components of the desired and specification strings.
     * Each component is converted as a decimal integer and the values
     * compared.
     * If the specification value is greater than the desired
     * value true is returned. If the value is less false is returned.
     * If the values are equal the period is skipped and the next pair of
     * components is compared.
     *
     * @param desired the version string of the desired version.
     * @return true if this package's version number is greater
     *          than or equal to the desired version number
