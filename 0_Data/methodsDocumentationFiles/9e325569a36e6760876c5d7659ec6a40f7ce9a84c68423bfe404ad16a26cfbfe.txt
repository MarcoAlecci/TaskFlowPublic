     * <p>Returns a subset of {@link #getAvailableCaptureRequestKeys} keys that can
     * be overridden for physical devices backing a logical multi-camera.</p>
     *
     * <p>This is a subset of android.request.availableRequestKeys which contains a list
     * of keys that can be overridden using {@link CaptureRequest.Builder#setPhysicalCameraKey }.
     * The respective value of such request key can be obtained by calling
     * {@link CaptureRequest.Builder#getPhysicalCameraKey }. Capture requests that contain
     * individual physical device requests must be built via
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createCaptureRequest(int, Set)}.</p>
     *
     * <p>The list returned is not modifiable, so any attempts to modify it will throw
     * a {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Each key is only listed once in the list. The order of the keys is undefined.</p>
     *
     * @return List of keys that can be overridden in individual physical device requests.
     * In case the camera device doesn't support such keys the list can be null.
