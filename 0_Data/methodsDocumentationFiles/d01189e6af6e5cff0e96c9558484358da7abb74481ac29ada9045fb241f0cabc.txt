     * Called when an error has occurred during processing. This can be called
     * at any point in the synthesis process. Note that there might be calls
     * to {@link #onStart(String)} for specified utteranceId but there will never
     * be a call to both {@link #onDone(String)} and {@link #onError(String,int)} for
     * the same utterance. The default implementation calls {@link #onError(String)}.
     *
     * @param utteranceId The utterance ID of the utterance.
     * @param errorCode one of the ERROR_* codes from {@link TextToSpeech}
