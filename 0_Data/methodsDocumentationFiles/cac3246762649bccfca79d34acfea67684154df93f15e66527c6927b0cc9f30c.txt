     *
     * <p>As of Android 3.0, devices may not have a permanent menu key available.
     * Apps should use the action bar to present menu options to users.
     * However, there are some apps where the action bar is inappropriate
     * or undesirable. This method may be used to detect if a menu key is present.
     * If not, applications should provide another on-screen affordance to access
     * functionality.
     *
     * @return true if a permanent menu key is present, false otherwise.
