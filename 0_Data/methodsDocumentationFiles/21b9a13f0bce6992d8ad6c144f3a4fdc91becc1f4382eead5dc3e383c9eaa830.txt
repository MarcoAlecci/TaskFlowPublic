     * When using collections (eg. {@link ListView}, {@link StackView} etc.) in widgets, it is very
     * costly to set PendingIntents on the individual items, and is hence not recommended. Instead
     * a single PendingIntent template can be set on the collection, see {@link
     * RemoteViews#setPendingIntentTemplate(int, PendingIntent)}, and the individual on-click
     * action of a given item can be distinguished by setting a fillInIntent on that item. The
     * fillInIntent is then combined with the PendingIntent template in order to determine the final
     * intent which will be executed when the item is clicked. This works as follows: any fields
     * which are left blank in the PendingIntent template, but are provided by the fillInIntent
     * will be overwritten, and the resulting PendingIntent will be used. The rest
     * of the PendingIntent template will then be filled in with the associated fields that are
     * set in fillInIntent. See {@link Intent#fillIn(Intent, int)} for more details.
     *
     * @param viewId The id of the view on which to set the fillInIntent
     * @param fillInIntent The intent which will be combined with the parent's PendingIntent
     *        in order to determine the on-click behavior of the view specified by viewId
