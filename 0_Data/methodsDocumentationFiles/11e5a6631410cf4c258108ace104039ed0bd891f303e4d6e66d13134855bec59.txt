     * <p>Change the width and height measure specs that are given to the
     * window manager by the popup.  By default these are 0, meaning that
     * the current width or height is requested as an explicit size from
     * the window manager.  You can supply
     * {@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#WRAP_CONTENT} or
     * {@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#MATCH_PARENT} to have that measure
     * spec supplied instead, replacing the absolute width and height that
     * has been set in the popup.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the popup is showing, calling this method will take effect only
     * the next time the popup is shown.</p>
     *
     * @param widthSpec an explicit width measure spec mode, either
     * {@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#WRAP_CONTENT},
     * {@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#MATCH_PARENT}, or 0 to use the absolute
     * width.
     * @param heightSpec an explicit height measure spec mode, either
     * {@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#WRAP_CONTENT},
     * {@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#MATCH_PARENT}, or 0 to use the absolute
     * height.
