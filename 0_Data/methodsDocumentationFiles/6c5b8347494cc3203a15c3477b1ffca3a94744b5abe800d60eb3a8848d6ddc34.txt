     * Plays the ValueAnimator in reverse. If the animation is already running,
     * it will stop itself and play backwards from the point reached when reverse was called.
     * If the animation is not currently running, then it will start from the end and
     * play backwards. This behavior is only set for the current animation; future playing
     * of the animation will use the default behavior of playing forward.
