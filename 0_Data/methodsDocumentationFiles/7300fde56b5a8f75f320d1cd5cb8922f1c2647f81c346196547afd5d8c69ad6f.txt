     * Returns whether the device is being used as a managed kiosk. These requirements are as
     * follows:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>The device is in Lock Task (therefore there is also a Device Owner app on the
     *     device)</li>
     *     <li>The Lock Task feature {@link DevicePolicyManager#LOCK_TASK_FEATURE_SYSTEM_INFO} is
     *     not enabled, so the system info in the status bar is not visible</li>
     *     <li>The device does not have a secure lock screen (e.g. it has no lock screen or has
     *     swipe-to-unlock)</li>
     *     <li>The device is not in the middle of an ephemeral user session</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Publicly-accessible dedicated devices don't have the same privacy model as
     * personally-used devices. In particular, user consent popups don't make sense as a barrier to
     * accessing persistent data on these devices since the user giving consent and the user whose
     * data is on the device are unlikely to be the same. These consent popups prevent the true
     * remote management of these devices.
     *
     * <p>This condition is not sufficient to cover APIs that would access data that only lives for
     * the duration of the user's session, since the user has an expectation of privacy in these
     * conditions that more closely resembles use of a personal device. In those cases, see {@link
     * #isUnattendedManagedKiosk()}.
