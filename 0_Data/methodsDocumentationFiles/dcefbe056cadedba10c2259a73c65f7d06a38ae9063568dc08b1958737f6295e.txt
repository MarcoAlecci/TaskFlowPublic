     * <p>Starting this <code>AnimatorSet</code> will, in turn, start the animations for which
     * it is responsible. The details of when exactly those animations are started depends on
     * the dependency relationships that have been set up between the animations.
     *
     * <b>Note:</b> Manipulating AnimatorSet's lifecycle in the child animators' listener callbacks
     * will lead to undefined behaviors. Also, AnimatorSet will ignore any seeking in the child
     * animators once {@link #start()} is called.
