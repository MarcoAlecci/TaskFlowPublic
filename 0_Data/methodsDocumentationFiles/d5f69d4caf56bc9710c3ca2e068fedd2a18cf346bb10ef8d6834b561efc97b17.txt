     * @deprecated   This method was designed to suspend the Thread but it was
     *   inherently deadlock-prone.  If the target thread holds a lock on the
     *   monitor protecting a critical system resource when it is suspended, no
     *   thread can access this resource until the target thread is resumed. If
     *   the thread that would resume the target thread attempts to lock this
     *   monitor prior to calling <code>resume</code>, deadlock results.  Such
     *   deadlocks typically manifest themselves as "frozen" processes.

     *   are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?</a>.
