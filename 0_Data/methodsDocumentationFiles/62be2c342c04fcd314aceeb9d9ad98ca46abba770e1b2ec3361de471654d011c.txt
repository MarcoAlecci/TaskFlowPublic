     * Returns a zoned date-time from this date at the earliest valid time according
     * to the rules in the time-zone.
     * <p>
     * Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
     * is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may not be midnight.
     * <p>
     * In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
     * In the case of an overlap, there are two valid offsets, and the earlier one is used,
     * corresponding to the first occurrence of midnight on the date.
     * In the case of a gap, the zoned date-time will represent the instant just after the gap.
     * <p>
     * If the zone ID is a {@link ZoneOffset}, then the result always has a time of midnight.
     * <p>
     * To convert to a specific time in a given time-zone call {@link #atTime(LocalTime)}
     * followed by {@link LocalDateTime#atZone(ZoneId)}.
     *
     * @param zone  the zone ID to use, not null
     * @return the zoned date-time formed from this date and the earliest valid time for the zone, not null
