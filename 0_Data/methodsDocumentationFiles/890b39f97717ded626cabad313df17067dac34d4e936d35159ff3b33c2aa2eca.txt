     * Override this to handle requests to open a file blob.
     * The default implementation always throws {@link FileNotFoundException}.
     * This method can be called from multiple threads, as described in
     * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     *
     * <p>This method returns a ParcelFileDescriptor, which is returned directly
     * to the caller.  This way large data (such as images and documents) can be
     * returned without copying the content.
     *
     * <p>The returned ParcelFileDescriptor is owned by the caller, so it is
     * their responsibility to close it when done.  That is, the implementation
     * of this method should create a new ParcelFileDescriptor for each call.
     * <p>
     * If opened with the exclusive "r" or "w" modes, the returned
     * ParcelFileDescriptor can be a pipe or socket pair to enable streaming
     * of data. Opening with the "rw" or "rwt" modes implies a file on disk that
     * supports seeking.
     * <p>
     * If you need to detect when the returned ParcelFileDescriptor has been
     * closed, or if the remote process has crashed or encountered some other
     * error, you can use {@link ParcelFileDescriptor#open(File, int,
     * android.os.Handler, android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor.OnCloseListener)},
     * {@link ParcelFileDescriptor#createReliablePipe()}, or
     * {@link ParcelFileDescriptor#createReliableSocketPair()}.
     *
     * <p class="note">For use in Intents, you will want to implement {@link #getType}
     * to return the appropriate MIME type for the data returned here with
     * the same URI.  This will allow intent resolution to automatically determine the data MIME
     * type and select the appropriate matching targets as part of its operation.</p>
     *
     * <p class="note">For better interoperability with other applications, it is recommended
     * that for any URIs that can be opened, you also support queries on them
     * containing at least the columns specified by {@link android.provider.OpenableColumns}.
     * You may also want to support other common columns if you have additional meta-data
     * to supply, such as {@link android.provider.MediaStore.MediaColumns#DATE_ADDED}
     * in {@link android.provider.MediaStore.MediaColumns}.</p>
     *
     * @param uri The URI whose file is to be opened.
     * @param mode Access mode for the file. May be "r" for read-only access,
     *            "w" for write-only access, "rw" for read and write access, or
     *            "rwt" for read and write access that truncates any existing
     *            file.
     * @param signal A signal to cancel the operation in progress, or
     *            {@code null} if none. For example, if you are downloading a
     *            file from the network to service a "rw" mode request, you
     *            should periodically call
     *            {@link CancellationSignal#throwIfCanceled()} to check whether
     *            the client has canceled the request and abort the download.
     *
     * @return Returns a new ParcelFileDescriptor which you can use to access
     * the file.
     *
     * @throws FileNotFoundException Throws FileNotFoundException if there is
     * no file associated with the given URI or the mode is invalid.
     * @throws SecurityException Throws SecurityException if the caller does
     * not have permission to access the file.
