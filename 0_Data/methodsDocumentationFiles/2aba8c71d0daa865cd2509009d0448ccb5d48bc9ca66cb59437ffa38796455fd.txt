         *
         * <p>A session is closed when a new session is created by the parent camera device,
         * or when the parent camera device is closed (either by the user closing the device,
         * or due to a camera device disconnection or fatal error).</p>
         *
         * <p>Once a session is closed, all methods on it will throw an IllegalStateException, and
         * any repeating requests or bursts are stopped (as if {@link #stopRepeating()} was called).
         * However, any in-progress capture requests submitted to the session will be completed
         * as normal.</p>

         * @param session the session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
