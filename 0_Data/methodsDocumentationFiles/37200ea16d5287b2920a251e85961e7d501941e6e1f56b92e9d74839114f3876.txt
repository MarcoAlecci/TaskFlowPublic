     * Called when the fullscreen-mode extracting editor info has changed,
     * to determine whether the extracting (extract text and candidates) portion
     * of the UI should be shown.  The standard implementation hides or shows
     * the extract area depending on whether it makes sense for the
     * current editor.  In particular, a {@link InputType#TYPE_NULL}
     * input type or {@link EditorInfo#IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI} flag will
     * turn off the extract area since there is no text to be shown.
