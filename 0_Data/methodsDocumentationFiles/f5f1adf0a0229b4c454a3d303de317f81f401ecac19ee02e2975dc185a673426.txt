     * Starts the face detection. This should be called after preview is started.
     * The camera will notify {@link FaceDetectionListener} of the detected
     * faces in the preview frame. The detected faces may be the same as the
     * previous ones. Applications should call {@link #stopFaceDetection} to
     * stop the face detection. This method is supported if {@link
     * Parameters#getMaxNumDetectedFaces()} returns a number larger than 0.
     * If the face detection has started, apps should not call this again.
     *
     * <p>When the face detection is running, {@link Parameters#setWhiteBalance(String)},
     * {@link Parameters#setFocusAreas(List)}, and {@link Parameters#setMeteringAreas(List)}
     * have no effect. The camera uses the detected faces to do auto-white balance,
     * auto exposure, and autofocus.
     *
     * <p>If the apps call {@link #autoFocus(AutoFocusCallback)}, the camera
     * will stop sending face callbacks. The last face callback indicates the
     * areas used to do autofocus. After focus completes, face detection will
     * resume sending face callbacks. If the apps call {@link
     * #cancelAutoFocus()}, the face callbacks will also resume.</p>
     *
     * <p>After calling {@link #takePicture(Camera.ShutterCallback, Camera.PictureCallback,
     * Camera.PictureCallback)} or {@link #stopPreview()}, and then resuming
     * preview with {@link #startPreview()}, the apps should call this method
     * again to resume face detection.</p>
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the face detection is unsupported.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the method fails or the face detection is
     *         already running.
