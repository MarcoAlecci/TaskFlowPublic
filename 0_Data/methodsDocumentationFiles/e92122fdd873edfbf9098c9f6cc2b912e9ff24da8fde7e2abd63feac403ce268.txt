     * Specifies an action to take place when the next animation ends. The action is only
     * run if the animation ends normally; if the ViewPropertyAnimator is canceled during
     * that animation, the runnable will not run.
     * This method, along with {@link #withStartAction(Runnable)}, is intended to help facilitate
     * choreographing ViewPropertyAnimator animations with other animations or actions
     * in the application.
     *
     * <p>For example, the following code animates a view to x=200 and then back to 0:</p>
     * <pre>
     *     Runnable endAction = new Runnable() {
     *         public void run() {
     *             view.animate().x(0);
     *         }
     *     };
     *     view.animate().x(200).withEndAction(endAction);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param runnable The action to run when the next animation ends.
     * @return This object, allowing calls to methods in this class to be chained.
