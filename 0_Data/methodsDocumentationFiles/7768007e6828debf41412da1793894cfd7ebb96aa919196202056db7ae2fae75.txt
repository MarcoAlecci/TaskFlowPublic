     * Resets the middleware's knowledge of previously-downloaded files in this download request.
     *
     * Normally, the middleware keeps track of the hashes of downloaded files and won't re-download
     * files whose server-reported hash matches one of the already-downloaded files. This means
     * that if the file is accidentally deleted by the user or by the app, the middleware will
     * not try to download it again.
     * This method will reset the middleware's cache of hashes for the provided
     * {@link DownloadRequest}, so that previously downloaded content will be downloaded again
     * when available.
     * This will not interrupt in-progress downloads.
     *
     * This is distinct from cancelling and re-issuing the download request -- if you cancel and
     * re-issue, the middleware will not clear its cache of download state information.
     *
     * If the middleware is not aware of the specified download request, an
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown.
     *
     * @param downloadRequest The request to re-download files for.
