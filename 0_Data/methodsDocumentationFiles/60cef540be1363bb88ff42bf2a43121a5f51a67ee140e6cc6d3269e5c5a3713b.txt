     * RecyclerView can perform several optimizations if it can know in advance that RecyclerView's
     * size is not affected by the adapter contents. RecyclerView can still change its size based
     * on other factors (e.g. its parent's size) but this size calculation cannot depend on the
     * size of its children or contents of its adapter (except the number of items in the adapter).
     * <p>
     * If your use of RecyclerView falls into this category, set this to {@code true}. It will allow
     * RecyclerView to avoid invalidating the whole layout when its adapter contents change.
     *
     * @param hasFixedSize true if adapter changes cannot affect the size of the RecyclerView.
