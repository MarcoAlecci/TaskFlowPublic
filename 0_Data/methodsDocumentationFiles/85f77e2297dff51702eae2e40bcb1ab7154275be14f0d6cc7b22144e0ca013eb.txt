     * Gets the list of all recently committed rollbacks.
     * This is for the purposes of preventing re-install of a bad version of a
     * package and monitoring the status of a staged rollback.
     * <p>
     * Returns an empty list if there are no recently committed rollbacks.
     * <p>
     * To avoid having to keep around complete rollback history forever on a
     * device, the returned list of rollbacks is only guaranteed to include
     * rollbacks that are still relevant. A rollback is no longer considered
     * relevant if the package is subsequently uninstalled or upgraded
     * (without the possibility of rollback) to a higher version code than was
     * rolled back from.
     *
     * @return the recently committed rollbacks
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller does not have appropriate permissions.
