     * Draw a series of points. Each point is centered at the coordinate specified by pts[], and its
     * diameter is specified by the paint's stroke width (as transformed by the canvas' CTM), with
     * special treatment for a stroke width of 0, which always draws exactly 1 pixel (or at most 4
     * if antialiasing is enabled). The shape of the point is controlled by the paint's Cap type.
     * The shape is a square, unless the cap type is Round, in which case the shape is a circle.
     *
     * @param pts Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...]
     * @param offset Number of values to skip before starting to draw.
     * @param count The number of values to process, after skipping offset of them. Since one point
     *            uses two values, the number of "points" that are drawn is really (count >> 1).
     * @param paint The paint used to draw the points
