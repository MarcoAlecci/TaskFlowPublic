     * Turn off the local Bluetooth adapter&mdash;do not use without explicit
     * user action to turn off Bluetooth.
     * <p>This gracefully shuts down all Bluetooth connections, stops Bluetooth
     * system services, and powers down the underlying Bluetooth hardware.
     * <p class="caution"><strong>Bluetooth should never be disabled without
     * direct user consent</strong>. The {@link #disable()} method is
     * provided only for applications that include a user interface for changing
     * system settings, such as a "power manager" app.</p>
     * <p>This is an asynchronous call: it will return immediately, and
     * clients should listen for {@link #ACTION_STATE_CHANGED}
     * to be notified of subsequent adapter state changes. If this call returns
     * true, then the adapter state will immediately transition from {@link
     * #STATE_ON} to {@link #STATE_TURNING_OFF}, and some time
     * later transition to either {@link #STATE_OFF} or {@link
     * #STATE_ON}. If this call returns false then there was an
     * immediate problem that will prevent the adapter from being turned off -
     * such as the adapter already being turned off.
     *
     * @return true to indicate adapter shutdown has begun, or false on immediate error
