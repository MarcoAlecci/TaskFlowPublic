     * Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order.
     *
     * @implNote The sorting algorithm is a parallel sort-merge that breaks the
     * array into sub-arrays that are themselves sorted and then merged. When
     * the sub-array length reaches a minimum granularity, the sub-array is
     * sorted using the appropriate {@link Arrays#sort(long[]) Arrays.sort}
     * method. If the length of the specified array is less than the minimum
     * granularity, then it is sorted using the appropriate {@link
     * Arrays#sort(long[]) Arrays.sort} method. The algorithm requires a
     * working space no greater than the size of the original array. The
     * {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool() ForkJoin common pool} is used to
     * execute any parallel tasks.
