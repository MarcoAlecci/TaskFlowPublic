     * Returns the next cursor position in the run.  This avoids placing the cursor between
     * surrogates, between characters that form conjuncts, between base characters and combining
     * marks, or within a reordering cluster.
     *
     * <p>The context is the shaping context for cursor movement, generally the bounds of the metric
     * span enclosing the cursor in the direction of movement.
     * <code>contextStart</code>, <code>contextEnd</code> and <code>offset</code> are relative to
     * the start of the string.</p>
     *
     * <p>If cursorOpt is CURSOR_AT and the offset is not a valid cursor position,
     * this returns -1.  Otherwise this will never return a value before contextStart or after
     * contextEnd.</p>
     *
     * @param contextStart the start index of the context
     * @param contextEnd the (non-inclusive) end index of the context
     * @param dir 1 if the run is RTL, otherwise 0
     * @param offset the cursor position to move from
     * @param cursorOpt how to move the cursor, one of CURSOR_AFTER,
     * CURSOR_AT_OR_AFTER, CURSOR_BEFORE,
     * CURSOR_AT_OR_BEFORE, or CURSOR_AT
     * @param p the Paint object that is requesting this information
     * @return the offset of the next position, or -1
