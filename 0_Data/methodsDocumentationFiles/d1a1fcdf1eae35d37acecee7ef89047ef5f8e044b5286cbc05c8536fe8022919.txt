     * When a view has focus and the user navigates away from it, the next view is searched for
     * starting from the rectangle filled in by this method.
     *
     * By default, the rectangle is the {@link #getDrawingRect(android.graphics.Rect)})
     * of the view.  However, if your view maintains some idea of internal selection,
     * such as a cursor, or a selected row or column, you should override this method and
     * fill in a more specific rectangle.
     *
     * @param r The rectangle to fill in, in this view's coordinates.
