     * Computes the Altitude in meters from the atmospheric pressure and the
     * pressure at sea level.
     * <p>
     * Typically the atmospheric pressure is read from a
     * {@link Sensor#TYPE_PRESSURE} sensor. The pressure at sea level must be
     * known, usually it can be retrieved from airport databases in the
     * vicinity. If unknown, you can use {@link #PRESSURE_STANDARD_ATMOSPHERE}
     * as an approximation, but absolute altitudes won't be accurate.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To calculate altitude differences, you must calculate the difference
     * between the altitudes at both points. If you don't know the altitude
     * as sea level, you can use {@link #PRESSURE_STANDARD_ATMOSPHERE} instead,
     * which will give good results considering the range of pressure typically
     * involved.
