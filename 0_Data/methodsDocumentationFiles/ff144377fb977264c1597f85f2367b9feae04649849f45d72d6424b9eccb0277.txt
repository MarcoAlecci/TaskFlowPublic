     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to set restrictions on the parent
     * profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param timeMs The new desired maximum time to lock in milliseconds. A value of 0 means there
     *            is no restriction.

     *             {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_FORCE_LOCK}
