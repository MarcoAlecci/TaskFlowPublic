     * Adds a TextWatcher to the list of those whose methods are called
     * whenever this TextView's text changes.
     * <p>
     * In 1.0, the {@link TextWatcher#afterTextChanged} method was erroneously
     * not called after {@link #setText} calls.  Now, doing {@link #setText}
     * if there are any text changed listeners forces the buffer type to
     * Editable if it would not otherwise be and does call this method.
