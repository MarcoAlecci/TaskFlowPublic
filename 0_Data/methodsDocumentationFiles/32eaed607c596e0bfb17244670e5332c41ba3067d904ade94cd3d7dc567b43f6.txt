     * Compute the interesting insets into your UI.  The default implementation
     * sets {@link Insets#contentInsets outInsets.contentInsets.top} to the height
     * of the window, meaning it should not adjust content underneath.  The default touchable
     * insets are {@link Insets#TOUCHABLE_INSETS_FRAME}, meaning it consumes all touch
     * events within its window frame.
     *
     * @param outInsets Fill in with the current UI insets.
