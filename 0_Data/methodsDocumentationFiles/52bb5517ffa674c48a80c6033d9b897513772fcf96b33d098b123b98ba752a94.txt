     * Sets a specified timeout value, in milliseconds, to be used
     * when opening a communications link to the resource referenced
     * by this URLConnection.  If the timeout expires before the
     * connection can be established, a
     * java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of zero is
     * interpreted as an infinite timeout.

     * <p> Some non-standard implementation of this method may ignore
     * the specified timeout. To see the connect timeout set, please
     * call getConnectTimeout().
     *
     * <p><strong>Warning</strong>: If the hostname resolves to multiple IP
     * addresses, Android's default implementation of {@link HttpURLConnection}
     * will try each in
     * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3484.txt">RFC 3484</a> order. If
     * connecting to each of these addresses fails, multiple timeouts will
     * elapse before the connect attempt throws an exception. Host names
     * that support both IPv6 and IPv4 always have at least 2 IP addresses.
     *
     * @param timeout an {@code int} that specifies the connect
     *               timeout value in milliseconds
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the timeout parameter is negative
