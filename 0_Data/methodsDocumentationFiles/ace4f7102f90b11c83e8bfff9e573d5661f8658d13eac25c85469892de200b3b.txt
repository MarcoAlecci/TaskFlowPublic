     * <p>Specifies the density for this Canvas' backing bitmap.  This modifies
     * the target density of the canvas itself, as well as the density of its
     * backing bitmap via {@link Bitmap#setDensity(int) Bitmap.setDensity(int)}.
     *
     * @param density The new target density of the canvas, which is used
     * to determine the scaling factor when drawing a bitmap into it.  Use
     * {@link Bitmap#DENSITY_NONE} to disable bitmap scaling.
