     * Return a copy of the drawable's bounds in a new Rect. This returns the
     * same values as getBounds(), but the returned object is guaranteed to not
     * be changed later by the drawable (i.e. it retains no reference to this
     * rect). If the caller already has a Rect allocated, call copyBounds(rect).
