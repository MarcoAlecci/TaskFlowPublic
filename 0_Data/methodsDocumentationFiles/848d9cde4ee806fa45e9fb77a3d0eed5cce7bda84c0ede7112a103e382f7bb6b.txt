     * Sets the interpolator for the underlying animator that animates the requested properties.
     * By default, the animator uses the default interpolator for ValueAnimator. Calling this method
     * will cause the declared object to be used instead.
     *
     * @param interpolator The TimeInterpolator to be used for ensuing property animations. A value
     * of <code>null</code> will result in linear interpolation.
     * @return This object, allowing calls to methods in this class to be chained.
