     * @return true if there was an outstanding render request, false otherwise. If this is true
     * the caller should ensure that {@link #createRenderRequest()}
     * and {@link FrameRenderRequest#syncAndDraw()} is called at the soonest
     * possible time to resume normal operation.

     * TODO Should this be exposed? ViewRootImpl needs it because it destroys the old
     * Surface before getting a new one. However things like SurfaceView will ensure that
     * the old surface remains un-destroyed until after a new frame has been produced with
     * the new surface.
