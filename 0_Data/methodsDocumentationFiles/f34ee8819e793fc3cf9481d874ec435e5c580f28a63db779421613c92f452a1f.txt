     * Controls whether the saving of this view's state is
     * enabled (that is, whether its {@link #onSaveInstanceState} method
     * will be called).  Note that even if freezing is enabled, the
     * view still must have an id assigned to it (via {@link #setId(int)})
     * for its state to be saved.  This flag can only disable the
     * saving of this view; any child views may still have their state saved.
     *
     * @param enabled Set to false to <em>disable</em> state saving, or true
     * (the default) to allow it.
