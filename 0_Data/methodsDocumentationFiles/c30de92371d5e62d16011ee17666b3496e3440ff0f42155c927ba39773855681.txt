     * Same as {@link #queryContentProviders}, except when {@code metaDataKey} is not null,
     * it only returns providers which have metadata with the {@code metaDataKey} key.
     *
     * <p>DO NOT USE the {@code metaDataKey} parameter, unless you're the contacts provider.
     * You really shouldn't need it.  Other apps should use {@link #queryIntentContentProviders}
     * instead.
     *
     * <p>The {@code metaDataKey} parameter was added to allow the contacts provider to quickly
     * scan the GAL providers on the device.  Unfortunately the discovery protocol used metadata
     * to mark GAL providers, rather than intent filters, so we can't use
     * {@link #queryIntentContentProviders} for that.
