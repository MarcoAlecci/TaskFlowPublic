     * Get the previous collation element in the string.  <p>This iterator iterates
     * over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string.
     * Because there isn't necessarily a one-to-one mapping from characters to
     * collation elements, this doesn't mean the same thing as "return the
     * collation element [or ordering priority] of the previous character in the
     * string".</p>
     * <p>This function updates the iterator's internal pointer to point to the
     * collation element preceding the one it's currently pointing to and then
     * returns that element, while next() returns the current element and then
     * updates the pointer.  This means that when you change direction while
     * iterating (i.e., call next() and then call previous(), or call previous()
     * and then call next()), you'll get back the same element twice.</p>
