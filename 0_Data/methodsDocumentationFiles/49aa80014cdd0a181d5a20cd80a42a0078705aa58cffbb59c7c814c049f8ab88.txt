     * Performs attestation of the device's identifiers. This method returns a certificate chain
     * whose first element contains the requested device identifiers in an extension. The device's
     * manufacturer, model, brand, device and product are always also included in the attestation.
     * If the device supports attestation in secure hardware, the chain will be rooted at a
     * trustworthy CA key. Otherwise, the chain will be rooted at an untrusted certificate. See

     * Attestation will only be successful when all of the following are true:
     * 1) The device has been set up to support device identifier attestation at the factory.
     * 2) The user has not permanently disabled device identifier attestation.
     * 3) You have permission to access the device identifiers you are requesting attestation for.
     * <p>
     * For privacy reasons, you cannot distinguish between (1) and (2). If attestation is
     * unsuccessful, the device may not support it in general or the user may have permanently
     * disabled it.
     *
     * @param context the context to use for retrieving device identifiers.
     * @param idTypes the types of device identifiers to attest.
     * @param attestationChallenge a blob to include in the certificate alongside the device
     * identifiers.
     *
     * @return a certificate chain containing the requested device identifiers in the first element
     *
     * @exception SecurityException if you are not permitted to obtain an attestation of the
     * device's identifiers.
     * @exception DeviceIdAttestationException if the attestation operation fails.
