     * Returns true if the device is currently in idle mode.  This happens when a device
     * has been sitting unused and unmoving for a sufficiently long period of time, so that
     * it decides to go into a lower power-use state.  This may involve things like turning
     * off network access to apps.  You can monitor for changes to this state with
     * {@link #ACTION_DEVICE_IDLE_MODE_CHANGED}.
     *
     * @return Returns true if currently in active device idle mode, else false.  This is
     * when idle mode restrictions are being actively applied; it will return false if the
     * device is in a long-term idle mode but currently running a maintenance window where
     * restrictions have been lifted.
