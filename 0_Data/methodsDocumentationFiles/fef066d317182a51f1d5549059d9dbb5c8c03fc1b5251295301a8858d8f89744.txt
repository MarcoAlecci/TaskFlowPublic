     * Returns a random positive {@code BigInteger} instance in the range {@code
     * [0, pow(2, bitLength)-1]} which is probably prime. The probability that
     * the returned {@code BigInteger} is prime is greater than {@code 1 - 1/2<sup>100</sup>)}.
     *
     * @param bitLength length of the new {@code BigInteger} in bits.
     * @return probably prime random {@code BigInteger} instance.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code bitLength < 2}.
