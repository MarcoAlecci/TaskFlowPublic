     * Returns {@code true} if the StrongBox Keymaster implementation on the device was provisioned
     * with an individual attestation certificate and can sign attestation records using it (as
     * attestation using an individual attestation certificate is a feature only Keymaster
     * implementations with StrongBox security level can implement).
     * For use prior to calling
     * {@link #generateKeyPair(ComponentName, String, KeyGenParameterSpec, int)}.
     * @return {@code true} if individual attestation is supported.
