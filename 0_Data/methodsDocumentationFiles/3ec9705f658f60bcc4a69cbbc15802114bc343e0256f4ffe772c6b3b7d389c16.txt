     * implementation to try to reach the host, but firewalls and server
     * configuration may block requests resulting in a unreachable status
     * while some specific ports may be accessible.
     * <p>
     * Android implementation attempts ICMP ECHO REQUESTs first, on failure it
     * will fall back to TCP ECHO REQUESTs. Success on either protocol will
     * return true.

     * The {@code network interface} and {@code ttl} parameters
     * let the caller specify which network interface the test will go through
     * and the maximum number of hops the packets should go through.
     * A negative value for the {@code ttl} will result in an
     * IllegalArgumentException being thrown.
     * <p>
     * The timeout value, in milliseconds, indicates the maximum amount of time
     * the try should take. If the operation times out before getting an
     * answer, the host is deemed unreachable. A negative value will result
     * in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown.
