     * Prepares a statement for execution but does not bind its parameters or execute it.
     * <p>
     * This method can be used to check for syntax errors during compilation
     * prior to execution of the statement.  If the {@code outStatementInfo} argument
     * is not null, the provided {@link SQLiteStatementInfo} object is populated
     * with information about the statement.
     * </p><p>
     * A prepared statement makes no reference to the arguments that may eventually
     * be bound to it, consequently it it possible to cache certain prepared statements
     * such as SELECT or INSERT/UPDATE statements.  If the statement is cacheable,
     * then it will be stored in the cache for later and reused if possible.

     * @param sql The SQL statement to prepare.
     * @param connectionFlags The connection flags to use if a connection must be

     * @param cancellationSignal A signal to cancel the operation in progress, or null if none.
     * @param outStatementInfo The {@link SQLiteStatementInfo} object to populate
     * with information about the statement, or null if none.
