     * Start listening to tethering change events. Any new added callback will receive the last
     * tethering status right away. If callback is registered when tethering has no upstream or
     * disabled, {@link OnTetheringEventCallback#onUpstreamChanged} will immediately be called
     * with a null argument. The same callback object cannot be registered twice.
     *
     * @param executor the executor on which callback will be invoked.
     * @param callback the callback to be called when tethering has change events.
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link TetheringManager#registerTetheringEventCallback} instead.
