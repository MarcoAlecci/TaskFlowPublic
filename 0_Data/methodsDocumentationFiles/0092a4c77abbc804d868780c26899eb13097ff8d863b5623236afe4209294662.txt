     * Default implementation of
     * {@link android.view.Window.Callback#onPreparePanel}
     * for activities.  This
     * calls through to the new {@link #onPrepareOptionsMenu} method for the
     * {@link android.view.Window#FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL}
     * panel, so that subclasses of
     * Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.
