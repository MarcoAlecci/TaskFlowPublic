     * Used by apex modules to register a "service wrapper" that is tied to a specific
     * {@link Context}.
     *
     * <p>This can only be called from the methods called by the static initializer of
     * {@link SystemServiceRegistry}. (Otherwise it throws a {@link IllegalStateException}.)
     *
     * @param serviceName the name of the binder object, such as
     *     {@link Context#JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE}.
     * @param serviceWrapperClass the wrapper class, such as the class of
     *     {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler}.
     * @param serviceProducer lambda that takes the service binder object with the name
     *     {@code serviceName}, a {@link Context} and returns an actual service wrapper instance.
