         * Copies the primaries of this color space in specified array. The Y
         * component is assumed to be 1 and is therefore not copied into the
         * destination. The x and y components of the first primary are written
         * in the array at positions 0 and 1 respectively.
         *
         * <p>Note: Some ColorSpaces represent gray profiles. The concept of
         * primaries for such a ColorSpace does not make sense, so we use a special
         * set of primaries that are all 1s.</p>
