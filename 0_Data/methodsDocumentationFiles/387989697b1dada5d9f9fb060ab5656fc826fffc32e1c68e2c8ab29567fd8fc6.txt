     * Calling this allows the activity behind this one to be seen again. Once all such activities
     * have been redrawn {@link TranslucentConversionListener#onTranslucentConversionComplete} will
     * be called indicating that it is safe to make this activity translucent again. Until
     * {@link TranslucentConversionListener#onTranslucentConversionComplete} is called the image
     * behind the frontmost activity will be indeterminate.
     *
     * @param callback the method to call when all visible activities behind this one have been
     * drawn and it is safe to make this activity translucent again.
     * @param options activity options delivered to the activity below this one. The options
     * are retrieved using {@link #getActivityOptions}.
     * @return <code>true</code> if Window was opaque and will become translucent or
     * <code>false</code> if window was translucent and no change needed to be made.
