     * <ol>
     *     <li>When {@link #setConferenceState(boolean)} is used to mark a conference as
     *     temporarily "not a conference"; we need to present the correct address in the in-call
     *     UI.</li>
     *     <li>When the conference is not hosted on the current device, we need to know the address
     *     information for the purpose of showing the original address to the user, as well as for
     *     logging to the call log.</li>
     * </ol>
     * @return The address of the conference, or {@code null} if not applicable.
