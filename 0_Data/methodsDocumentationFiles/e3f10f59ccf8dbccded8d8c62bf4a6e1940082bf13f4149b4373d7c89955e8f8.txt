     * Sets the send level of the audio track to the attached auxiliary effect
     * {@link #attachAuxEffect(int)}.  Effect levels
     * are clamped to the closed interval [0.0, max] where
     * max is the value of {@link #getMaxVolume}.
     * A value of 0.0 results in no effect, and a value of 1.0 is full send.
     * <p>By default the send level is 0.0f, so even if an effect is attached to the player
     * this method must be called for the effect to be applied.
     * <p>Note that the passed level value is a linear scalar. UI controls should be scaled
     * logarithmically: the gain applied by audio framework ranges from -72dB to at least 0dB,
     * so an appropriate conversion from linear UI input x to level is:
     * x == 0 -&gt; level = 0
     * 0 &lt; x &lt;= R -&gt; level = 10^(72*(x-R)/20/R)
     *
     * @param level linear send level
     * @return error code or success, see {@link #SUCCESS},
     *    {@link #ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION}, {@link #ERROR}
