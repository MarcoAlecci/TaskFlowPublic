     * Clear and initialize a TimingLogger object that will log using
     * the tag and label that was specified previously, either via
     * the constructor or a call to reset(tag, label). If the
     * Log.isLoggable is not enabled to at least the Log.VERBOSE
     * level for that tag at creation time then the addSplit and
     * dumpToLog call will do nothing.
