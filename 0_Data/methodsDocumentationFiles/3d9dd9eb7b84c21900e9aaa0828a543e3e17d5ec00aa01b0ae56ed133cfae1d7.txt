     * Default implementation of
     * {@link android.view.Window.Callback#onMenuItemSelected}
     * for activities.  This calls through to the new
     * {@link #onOptionsItemSelected} method for the
     * {@link android.view.Window#FEATURE_OPTIONS_PANEL}
     * panel, so that subclasses of
     * Activity don't need to deal with feature codes.
