     * Called when {@link ForceLoadContentObserver} detects a change.  The
     * default implementation checks to see if the loader is currently started;
     * if so, it simply calls {@link #forceLoad()}; otherwise, it sets a flag
     * so that {@link #takeContentChanged()} returns true.
     *
     * <p>Must be called from the process's main thread.
