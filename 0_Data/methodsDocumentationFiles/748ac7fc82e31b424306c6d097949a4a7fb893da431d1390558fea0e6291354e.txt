     * Creates an intent sender for a web link, if the document is web linkable.
     * <p>
     * {@link AuthenticationRequiredException} can be thrown if user does not have
     * sufficient permission for the linked document. Before any new permissions
     * are granted for the linked document, a visible UI must be shown, so the
     * user can explicitly confirm whether the permission grants are expected.
     * The user must be able to cancel the operation.
     * <p>
     * Options passed as an argument may include a list of recipients, such
     * as email addresses. The provider should reflect these options if possible,
     * but it's acceptable to ignore them. In either case, confirmation UI must
     * be shown before any new permission grants are granted.
     * <p>
     * It is all right to generate a web link without granting new permissions,
     * if opening the link would result in a page for requesting permission
     * access. If it's impossible then the operation must fail by throwing an exception.
     *
     * @param documentId the document to create a web link intent for.
     * @param options additional information, such as list of recipients. Optional.
     * @throws AuthenticationRequiredException If authentication is required from
     *            the user (such as login credentials), but it is not guaranteed
     *            that the client will handle this properly.
