     * <p>This is the second phase of the layout mechanism.
     * (The first is measuring). In this phase, each parent calls

     * This is typically done using the child measurements
     * that were stored in the measure pass().</p>

     * <p>Derived classes should not override this method.
     * Derived classes with children should override
     * onLayout. In that method, they should
     * call layout on each of their children.</p>
