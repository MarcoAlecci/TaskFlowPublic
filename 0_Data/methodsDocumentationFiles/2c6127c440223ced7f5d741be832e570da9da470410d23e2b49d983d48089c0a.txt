     * Sets the current playback state and the matching media position for the current playback
     *   speed.
     * @param state The current playback state, one of the following values:
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_STOPPED},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_PAUSED},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_PLAYING},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_FAST_FORWARDING},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_REWINDING},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_SKIPPING_FORWARDS},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_SKIPPING_BACKWARDS},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_BUFFERING},
     *       {@link #PLAYSTATE_ERROR}.
     * @param timeInMs a 0 or positive value for the current media position expressed in ms
     *    (same unit as for when sending the media duration, if applicable, with
     *    {@link android.media.MediaMetadataRetriever#METADATA_KEY_DURATION} in the
     *    {@link RemoteControlClient.MetadataEditor}). Negative values imply that position is not
     *    known (e.g. listening to a live stream of a radio) or not applicable (e.g. when state
     *    is {@link #PLAYSTATE_BUFFERING} and nothing had played yet).
     * @param playbackSpeed a value expressed as a ratio of 1x playback: 1.0f is normal playback,
     *    2.0f is 2x, 0.5f is half-speed, -2.0f is rewind at 2x speed. 0.0f means nothing is
     *    playing (e.g. when state is {@link #PLAYSTATE_ERROR}).
