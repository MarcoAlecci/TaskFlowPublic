     * Gets the memory difficulty parameter for the hashing algorithm.
     *
     * <p>The effect of this parameter depends on the algorithm in use. For example, please see
     * {@link #createScryptParams(byte[], int)} for choosing the parameter for SCRYPT.
     *
     * <p>If the specific algorithm does not support such a memory difficulty parameter, its value
     * should be -1.
