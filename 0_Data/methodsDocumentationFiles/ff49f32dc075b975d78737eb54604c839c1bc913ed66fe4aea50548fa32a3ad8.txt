     * Treat the specified array of colors as a bitmap, and draw it. This gives the same result as
     * first creating a bitmap from the array, and then drawing it, but this method avoids
     * explicitly creating a bitmap object which can be more efficient if the colors are changing
     * often.
     *
     * @param colors Array of colors representing the pixels of the bitmap
     * @param offset Offset into the array of colors for the first pixel
     * @param stride The number of colors in the array between rows (must be >= width or <= -width).
     * @param x The X coordinate for where to draw the bitmap
     * @param y The Y coordinate for where to draw the bitmap
     * @param width The width of the bitmap
     * @param height The height of the bitmap
     * @param hasAlpha True if the alpha channel of the colors contains valid values. If false, the
     *            alpha byte is ignored (assumed to be 0xFF for every pixel).
     * @param paint May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap
     * @deprecated Usage with a {@link #isHardwareAccelerated() hardware accelerated} canvas
     *             requires an internal copy of color buffer contents every time this method is
     *             called. Using a Bitmap avoids this copy, and allows the application to more
     *             explicitly control the lifetime and copies of pixel data.
