     * Unsets the off-host Secure Element for the given service.
     *
     * <p>Note that this will only remove Secure Element that was dynamically
     * set using the {@link #setOffHostForService(ComponentName, String)}
     * and resets it to a value that was statically assigned using manifest.
     *
     * <p>Note that you can only unset off-host SE for a service that
     * is running under the same UID as the caller of this API. Typically
     * this means you need to call this from the same
     * package as the service itself, though UIDs can also
     * be shared between packages using shared UIDs.
     *
     * @param service The component name of the service
     * @return whether the registration was successful.
