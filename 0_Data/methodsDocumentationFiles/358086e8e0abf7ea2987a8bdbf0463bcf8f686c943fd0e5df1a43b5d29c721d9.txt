     * Blend between {@code hsl1} and {@code hsl2} using the given ratio. This will interpolate
     * the hue using the shortest angle.
     *
     * <p>A blend ratio of 0.0 will result in {@code hsl1}, 0.5 will give an even blend,
     * 1.0 will result in {@code hsl2}.</p>

     * @param hsl1      3-element array which holds the first HSL color
     * @param hsl2      3-element array which holds the second HSL color
     * @param ratio     the blend ratio of {@code hsl1} to {@code hsl2}
     * @param outResult 3-element array which holds the resulting HSL components
