     * Sets the speed at which transition propagation happens, relative to the duration of the
     * Transition. A <code>propagationSpeed</code> of 1 means that a View centered at the side
     * set in {@link #setSide(int)} and View centered at the opposite edge will have a difference
     * in start delay of approximately the duration of the Transition. A speed of 2 means the
     * start delay difference will be approximately half of the duration of the transition. A
     * value of 0 is illegal, but negative values will invert the propagation.
     *
     * @param propagationSpeed The speed at which propagation occurs, relative to the duration
     *                         of the transition. A speed of 4 means it works 4 times as fast
     *                         as the duration of the transition. May not be 0.
