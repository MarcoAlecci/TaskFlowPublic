     * Gets the latest client state bundle set by the service in a
     * {@link FillResponse.Builder#setClientState(Bundle) fill response}.
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> Prior to Android {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P}, only client state
     * bundles set by {@link FillResponse.Builder#setClientState(Bundle)} were considered. On
     * Android {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} and higher, bundles set in the result of
     * an authenticated request through the
     * {@link android.view.autofill.AutofillManager#EXTRA_CLIENT_STATE} extra are
     * also considered (and take precedence when set).
     *
     * @return The client state.
