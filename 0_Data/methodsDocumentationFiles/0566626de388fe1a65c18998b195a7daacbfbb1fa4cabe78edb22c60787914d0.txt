     * Returns the minimum buffer size required for the successful creation of an AudioRecord
     * object, in byte units.
     * Note that this size doesn't guarantee a smooth recording under load, and higher values
     * should be chosen according to the expected frequency at which the AudioRecord instance
     * will be polled for new data.
     * See {@link #AudioRecord(int, int, int, int, int)} for more information on valid
     * configuration values.
     * @param sampleRateInHz the sample rate expressed in Hertz.
     *   {@link AudioFormat#SAMPLE_RATE_UNSPECIFIED} is not permitted.
     * @param channelConfig describes the configuration of the audio channels.
     *   See {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_IN_MONO} and
     *   {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_IN_STEREO}
     * @param audioFormat the format in which the audio data is represented.
     *   See {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_16BIT}.
     * @return {@link #ERROR_BAD_VALUE} if the recording parameters are not supported by the
     *  hardware, or an invalid parameter was passed,
     *  or {@link #ERROR} if the implementation was unable to query the hardware for its
     *  input properties,
     *   or the minimum buffer size expressed in bytes.
