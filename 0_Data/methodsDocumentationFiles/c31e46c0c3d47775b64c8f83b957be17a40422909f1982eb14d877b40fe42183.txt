     * Calculate the actual/effective/reported normalized rectangle data from a metering
     * rectangle.
     *
     * <p>If any of the rectangles are out-of-range of their intended bounding box,
     * the {@link #RECTANGLE_EMPTY empty rectangle} is substituted instead
     * (with a weight of {@code 0}).</p>
     *
     * <p>The metering rectangle is bound by the crop region (effective/reported respectively).
     * The metering {@link Camera.Area area} is bound by {@code [-1000, 1000]}.</p>
     *
     * <p>No parameters are mutated; returns the new metering data.</p>
     *
     * @param activeArraySize active array size of the sensor (e.g. max jpeg size)
     * @param meteringRect the user-specified metering rectangle
     * @param zoomData the calculated zoom data corresponding to this request
     *
     * @return the metering area, the reported/effective metering rectangles
