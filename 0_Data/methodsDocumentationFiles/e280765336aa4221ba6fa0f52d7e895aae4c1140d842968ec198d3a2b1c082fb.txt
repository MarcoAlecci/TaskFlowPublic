     * Force switch to the last used input method and subtype. If the last input method didn't have
     * any subtypes, the framework will simply switch to the last input method with no subtype
     * specified.
     * @param imeToken Supplies the identifying token given to an input method when it was started,
     * which allows it to perform this operation on itself.
     * @return true if the current input method and subtype was successfully switched to the last
     * used input method and subtype.
     * @deprecated Use {@link InputMethodService#switchToPreviousInputMethod()} instead. This method
     * was intended for IME developers who should be accessing APIs through the service. APIs in
     * this class are intended for app developers interacting with the IME.
