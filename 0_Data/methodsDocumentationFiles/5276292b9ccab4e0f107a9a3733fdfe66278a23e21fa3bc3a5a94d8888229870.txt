     * Perform calling of the application's {@link Application#onCreate}
     * method.  The default implementation simply calls through to that method.
     *
     * <p>Note: This method will be called immediately after {@link #onCreate(Bundle)}.
     * Often instrumentation tests start their test thread in onCreate(); you
     * need to be careful of races between these.  (Well between it and
     * everything else, but let's start here.)
     *
     * @param app The application being created.
