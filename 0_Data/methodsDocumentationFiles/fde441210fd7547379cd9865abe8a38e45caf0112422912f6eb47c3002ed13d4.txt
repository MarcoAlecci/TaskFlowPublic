     * Determine the best action to perform for a given Intent for a given user.
     * This is how {@link Intent#resolveActivity} finds an activity if a class
     * has not been explicitly specified.
     * <p>
     * <em>Note:</em> if using an implicit Intent (without an explicit
     * ComponentName specified), be sure to consider whether to set the
     * {@link #MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY} only flag. You need to do so to resolve the
     * activity in the same way that
     * {@link android.content.Context#startActivity(Intent)} and
     * {@link android.content.Intent#resolveActivity(PackageManager)
     * Intent.resolveActivity(PackageManager)} do.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param intent An intent containing all of the desired specification
     *            (action, data, type, category, and/or component).
     * @param flags Additional option flags to modify the data returned. The
     *            most important is {@link #MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY}, to limit the
     *            resolution to only those activities that support the
     *            {@link android.content.Intent#CATEGORY_DEFAULT}.
     * @param userId The user id.
     * @return Returns a ResolveInfo object containing the final activity intent
     *         that was determined to be the best action. Returns null if no
     *         matching activity was found. If multiple matching activities are
     *         found and there is no default set, returns a ResolveInfo object
     *         containing something else, such as the activity resolver.
     * @hide
