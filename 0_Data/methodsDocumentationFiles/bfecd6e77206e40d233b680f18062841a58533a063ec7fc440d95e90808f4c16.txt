     * Query for the possible MIME types for the representations the given
     * content URL can be returned when opened as as stream with
     * {@link #openTypedAssetFileDescriptor}.  Note that the types here are
     * not necessarily a superset of the type returned by {@link #getType} --
     * many content providers cannot return a raw stream for the structured
     * data that they contain.
     *
     * @param url A Uri identifying content (either a list or specific type),
     * using the content:// scheme.
     * @param mimeTypeFilter The desired MIME type.  This may be a pattern,
     * such as *&#47;*, to query for all available MIME types that match the
     * pattern.
     * @return Returns an array of MIME type strings for all available
     * data streams that match the given mimeTypeFilter.  If there are none,
     * null is returned.
