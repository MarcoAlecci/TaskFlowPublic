     * Retrieve the 4x4 texture coordinate transform matrix associated with the texture image set by
     * the most recent call to {@link #updateTexImage}.
     * <p>
     * This transform matrix maps 2D homogeneous texture coordinates of the form (s, t, 0, 1) with s
     * and t in the inclusive range [0, 1] to the texture coordinate that should be used to sample
     * that location from the texture.  Sampling the texture outside of the range of this transform
     * is undefined.
     * <p>
     * The matrix is stored in column-major order so that it may be passed directly to OpenGL ES via
     * the {@code glLoadMatrixf} or {@code glUniformMatrix4fv} functions.
     * <p>
     * If the underlying buffer has a crop associated with it, the transformation will also include
     * a slight scale to cut off a 1-texel border around the edge of the crop. This ensures that
     * when the texture is bilinear sampled that no texels outside of the buffer's valid region
     * are accessed by the GPU, avoiding any sampling artifacts when scaling.
     *
     * @param mtx the array into which the 4x4 matrix will be stored.  The array must have exactly
     *     16 elements.
