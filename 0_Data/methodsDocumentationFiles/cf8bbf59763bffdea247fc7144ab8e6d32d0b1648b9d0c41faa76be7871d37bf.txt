     * Draw the specified bitmap, scaling/translating automatically to fill the destination
     * rectangle. If the source rectangle is not null, it specifies the subset of the bitmap to
     * draw.
     * <p>
     * Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the
     * bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it
     * were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be
     * the edge color replicated.
     * <p>
     * This function <em>ignores the density associated with the bitmap</em>. This is because the
     * source and destination rectangle coordinate spaces are in their respective densities, so must
     * already have the appropriate scaling factor applied.
