     * with the same {@link RouteInfo.RouteKey} with different properties
     * (e.g., different MTU), it will be updated. If the {@link RouteInfo} had an
     * interface name set and that differs from the interface set for this

     * The proper course is to add either un-named or properly named {@link RouteInfo}.
