     * <p>This implementation returns false if the object is not a set, or
     * if the sets have different sizes.  Otherwise, for each value in this
     * set, it checks to make sure the value also exists in the other set.
     * If any value doesn't exist, the method returns false; otherwise, it
     * returns true.
