     * overwriting the bitmap's pixels. The data in the buffer is not changed
     * in any way (unlike setPixels(), which converts from unpremultipled 32bit
     * to whatever the bitmap's native format is. The pixels in the source
     * buffer are assumed to be in the bitmap's color space.</p>
     * <p>After this method returns, the current position of the buffer is
     * updated: the position is incremented by the number of elements read from
     * the buffer. If you need to read the bitmap from the buffer again you must
     * first rewind the buffer.</p>
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the bitmap's config is {@link Config#HARDWARE}
