     * This method should be triggered by the IMS providers when an outgoing message fails to be
     * sent due to an error generated while processing the message or after being sent to the
     * network.
     *
     * @param token token provided in {@link #sendSms(int, int, String, String, boolean, byte[])}
     * @param messageRef the message reference, which may be 1 byte if it is in
     *     {@link SmsMessage#FORMAT_3GPP} format (see TS.123.040) or 2 bytes if it is in
     *     {@link SmsMessage#FORMAT_3GPP2} format (see 3GPP2 C.S0015-B).
     * @param status result of sending the SMS.
     * @param networkErrorCode the error code reported by the carrier network if sending this SMS
     *  has resulted in an error or {@link #RESULT_NO_NETWORK_ERROR} if no network error was
     *  generated. See 3GPP TS 24.011 Section 7.3.4 for valid error codes and more information.
     *
     * @throws RuntimeException if called before {@link #onReady()} is triggered or if the
     * connection to the framework is not available. If this happens attempting to send the SMS
     * should be aborted.
