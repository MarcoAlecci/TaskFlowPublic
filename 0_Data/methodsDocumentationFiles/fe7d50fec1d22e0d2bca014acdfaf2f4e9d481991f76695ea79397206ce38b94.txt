     * Set an alternate description for the Home/Up action, when enabled.
     *
     * <p>This description is commonly used for accessibility/screen readers when
     * the Home action is enabled. (See {@link #setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(boolean)}.)
     * Examples of this are, "Navigate Home" or "Navigate Up" depending on the
     * {@link #DISPLAY_HOME_AS_UP} display option. If you have changed the home-as-up
     * indicator using {@link #setHomeAsUpIndicator(int)} to indicate more specific
     * functionality such as a sliding drawer, you should also set this to accurately
     * describe the action.</p>
     *
     * <p>Setting this to <code>null</code> will use the system default description.</p>
