     * Returns a {@link Set} view of the mappings contained in this map.
     * The returned set obeys the general contract outlined in
     * {@link Map#keySet()}.  The set's iterator will return the
     * mappings in the order their keys appear in map, which is their
     * natural order (the order in which the enum constants are declared).
