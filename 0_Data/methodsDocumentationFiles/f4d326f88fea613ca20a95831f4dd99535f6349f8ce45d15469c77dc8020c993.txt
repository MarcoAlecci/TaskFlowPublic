     * Sets a list of string values that can be selected by the user. If no user-visible entries
     * are set by a call to {@link #setChoiceEntries(String[])}, these values will be the ones
     * shown to the user. Values will be chosen from this list as the user's selection and the
     * selected values can be retrieved by a call to {@link #getAllSelectedStrings()}, or
     * {@link #getSelectedString()}, depending on whether it is a multi-select type or choice type.
     * This method is not relevant for types other than
     * {@link #TYPE_CHOICE}, and {@link #TYPE_MULTI_SELECT}.
     * @param choiceValues an array of Strings which will be the selected values for the user's
     * selections.
