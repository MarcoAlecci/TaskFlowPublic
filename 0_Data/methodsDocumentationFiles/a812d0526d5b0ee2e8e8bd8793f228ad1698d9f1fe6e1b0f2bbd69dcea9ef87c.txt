     * An NDEF Message can be formatted to bytes in different ways
     * depending on chunking, SR, and ID flags, so the length returned
     * by this method may not be equal to the length of the original
     * byte array used to construct this NDEF Message. However it will
     * always be equal to the length of the byte array produced by
     * {@link #toByteArray}.

     * @return length of this NDEF Message when written to bytes with {@link #toByteArray}
