     * <p>Free all buffers allocated for an output Surface.</p>
     *
     * <p>Normally, once allocated, the image buffers for a given output Surface remain allocated
     * for the lifetime of the capture session, to minimize latency of captures and to reduce
     * memory allocation overhead.</p>
     *
     * <p>However, in some cases, it may be desirable for allocated buffers to be freed to reduce
     * the application's memory consumption, if the particular output Surface will not be used by
     * the application for some time.</p>
     *
     * <p>The tearDown() method can be used to perform this operation. After the call finishes, all
     * unfilled image buffers will have been freed. Any future use of the target Surface may require
     * allocation of additional buffers, as if the session had just been created.  Buffers being
     * held by the application (either explicitly as Image objects from ImageReader, or implicitly
     * as the current texture in a SurfaceTexture or the current contents of a RS Allocation, will
     * remain valid and allocated even when tearDown is invoked.</p>
     *
     * <p>A Surface that has had tearDown() called on it is eligible to have prepare() invoked on it
     * again even if it was used as a request target before the tearDown() call, as long as it
     * doesn't get used as a target of a request between the tearDown() and prepare() calls.</p>

     * @param surface the output Surface for which buffers should be freed. Must be one of the

     * @throws CameraAccessException if the camera device is no longer connected or has
     *                               encountered a fatal error.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this session is no longer active, either because the session
     *                               was explicitly closed, a new session has been created
     *                               or the camera device has been closed.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the Surface is invalid, not part of this Session, or has
     *                                  already been used as a target of a CaptureRequest in this
     *                                  session or immediately prior sessions.
