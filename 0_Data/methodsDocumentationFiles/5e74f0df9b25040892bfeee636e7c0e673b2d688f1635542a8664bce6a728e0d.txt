     * Called by bindView() to set the image for an ImageView but only if
     * there is no existing ViewBinder or if the existing ViewBinder cannot
     * handle binding to an ImageView.
     *
     * By default, the value will be treated as an image resource. If the
     * value cannot be used as an image resource, the value is used as an
     * image Uri.
     *
     * This method is called instead of {@link #setViewImage(ImageView, int)}
     * if the supplied data is not an int or Integer.
     *
     * @param v ImageView to receive an image
     * @param value the value retrieved from the data set
     *
     * @see #setViewImage(ImageView, int)
