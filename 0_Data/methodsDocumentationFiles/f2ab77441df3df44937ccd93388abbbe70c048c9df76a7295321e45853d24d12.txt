         * <p> If the application that generated this {@link MessagingStyle} targets an SDK version
         * less than {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#P}, this method becomes dependent on whether or
         * not the conversation title is set; returning {@code true} if the conversation title is
         * a non-null value, or {@code false} otherwise. From {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#P} forward,
         * this method returns what's set by {@link #setGroupConversation(boolean)} allowing for
         * named, non-group conversations.
