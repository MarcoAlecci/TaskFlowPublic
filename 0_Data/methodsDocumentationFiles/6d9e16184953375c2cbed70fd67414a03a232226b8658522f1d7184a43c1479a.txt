     * Return a color-int from alpha, red, green, blue components.
     * These component values should be \([0..255]\), but there is no
     * range check performed, so if they are out of range, the
     * returned color is undefined.
     * @param alpha Alpha component \([0..255]\) of the color
     * @param red Red component \([0..255]\) of the color
     * @param green Green component \([0..255]\) of the color
     * @param blue Blue component \([0..255]\) of the color
