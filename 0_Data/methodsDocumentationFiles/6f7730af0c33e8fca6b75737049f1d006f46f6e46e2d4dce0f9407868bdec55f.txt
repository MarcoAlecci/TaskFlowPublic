     * Called by a ViewGroup subclass to remove child views from itself,
     * when it must first know its size on screen before it can calculate how many
     * child views it will render. An example is a Gallery or a ListView, which
     * may "have" 50 children, but actually only render the number of children
     * that can currently fit inside the object on screen. Do not call
     * this method unless you are extending ViewGroup and understand the
     * view measuring and layout pipeline.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> do not invoke this method from
     * {@link #draw(android.graphics.Canvas)}, {@link #onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)},
     * {@link #dispatchDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)} or any related method.</p>
