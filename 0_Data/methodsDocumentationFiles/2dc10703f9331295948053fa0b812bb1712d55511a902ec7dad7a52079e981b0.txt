     * conversions are based on the current {@link DisplayMetrics}

     * <p>
     * This method will throw an exception if the attribute is defined but is
     * not a dimension.

     * @param index Index of attribute to retrieve.
     * @param defValue Value to return if the attribute is not defined or
     *                 not a resource.
     *
     * @return Attribute dimension value multiplied by the appropriate
     *         metric, or defValue if not defined.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the TypedArray has already been recycled.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the attribute is defined but is
     *         not an integer.
