     * Remove a Tunnel Mode IPsec Transform from a {@link Network}. This must be used as part of
     * cleanup if a tunneled Network experiences a change in default route. The Network will drop
     * all traffic that cannot be routed to the Tunnel's outbound interface. If that interface is
     * lost, all traffic will drop.
     *
     * <p>TODO: Update javadoc for tunnel mode APIs at the same time the APIs are re-worked.
     *
     * @param net a network that currently has transform applied to it.
     * @param transform a Tunnel Mode IPsec Transform that has been previously applied to the given
