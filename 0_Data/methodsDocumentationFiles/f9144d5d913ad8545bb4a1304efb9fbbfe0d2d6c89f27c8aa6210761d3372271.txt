     * Constructs and returns an ObjectAnimator that animates over int values for a multiple
     * parameters setter. Only public methods that take only int parameters are supported.
     * Each <code>int[]</code> contains a complete set of parameters to the setter method.
     * At least two <code>int[]</code> values must be provided, a start and end. More than two
     * values imply a starting value, values to animate through along the way, and an ending
     * value (these values will be distributed evenly across the duration of the animation).
     *
     * @param target The object whose property is to be animated. This object may
     * have a public method on it called <code>setName()</code>, where <code>name</code> is
     * the value of the <code>propertyName</code> parameter. <code>propertyName</code> may also
     * be the case-sensitive complete name of the public setter method.
     * @param propertyName The name of the property being animated or the name of the setter method.
     * @param values A set of values that the animation will animate between over time.
     * @return An ObjectAnimator object that is set up to animate between the given values.
