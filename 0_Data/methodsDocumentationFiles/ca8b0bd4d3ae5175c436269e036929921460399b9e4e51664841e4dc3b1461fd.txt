     * Gets the estimate of the relative precision of the alignment of the
     * {@link #getElapsedRealtimeNanos()} timestamp, with the reported measurements in
     * nanoseconds (68% confidence).
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasElapsedRealtimeUncertaintyNanos()} is
     * {@code true}.
