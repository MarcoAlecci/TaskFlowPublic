     *
     * <p>A subsequent call to this method on the same {@code deviceId} could release the currently
     * acquired Hardware if TunerResourceManager(TRM) detects higher priority from the current
     * request.
     *
     * @param deviceId The device ID to acquire Hardware for.
     * @param info The TV input which will use the acquired Hardware.
     * @param tvInputSessionId a String returned to TIS when the session was created.
     *        {@see TvInputService#onCreateSession(String, String)}. If null, the client will be
     *        treated as a background app.
     * @param priorityHint The use case of the client. {@see TvInputService#PriorityHintUseCaseType}
     * @param executor the executor on which the listener would be invoked.
     * @param callback A callback to receive updates on Hardware.
     * @return Hardware on success, {@code null} otherwise. When the TRM decides to not grant
     *         resource, null is returned and the {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown with
     *         "No enough resources".
