     * Ask some other {@code ConnectionService} to create a {@code RemoteConnection} given an
     * incoming request. This is used by {@code ConnectionService}s that are registered with
     * {@link PhoneAccount#CAPABILITY_CONNECTION_MANAGER} and want to be able to manage
     * SIM-based incoming calls.
     *
     * @param connectionManagerPhoneAccount See description at
     *         {@link #onCreateOutgoingConnection(PhoneAccountHandle, ConnectionRequest)}.
     * @param request Details about the incoming call.
     * @return The {@code Connection} object to satisfy this call, or {@code null} to
     *         not handle the call.
