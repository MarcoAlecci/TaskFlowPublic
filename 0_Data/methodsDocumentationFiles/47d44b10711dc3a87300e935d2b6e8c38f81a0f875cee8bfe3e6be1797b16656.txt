     * Return the name of the process this instrumentation is running in.  Note this should
     * only be used for testing and debugging.  If you are thinking about using this to,
     * for example, conditionalize what is initialized in an Application class, it is strongly
     * recommended to instead use lazy initialization (such as a getter for the state that
     * only creates it when requested).  This can greatly reduce the work your process does
     * when created for secondary things, such as to receive a broadcast.
