     * Callback that allows an accessibility service to observe the key events
     * before they are passed to the rest of the system. This means that the events
     * are first delivered here before they are passed to the device policy, the
     * input method, or applications.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> It is important that key events are handled in such
     * a way that the event stream that would be passed to the rest of the system
     * is well-formed. For example, handling the down event but not the up event
     * and vice versa would generate an inconsistent event stream.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> The key events delivered in this method are copies
     * and modifying them will have no effect on the events that will be passed
     * to the system. This method is intended to perform purely filtering
     * functionality.
     * <p>
     *
     * @param event The event to be processed. This event is owned by the caller and cannot be used
     * after this method returns. Services wishing to use the event after this method returns should
     * make a copy.
     * @return If true then the event will be consumed and not delivered to
     *         applications, otherwise it will be delivered as usual.
