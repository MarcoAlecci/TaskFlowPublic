     * @return Maximum number of events of this sensor that could be batched. If this value is zero
     * it indicates that batch mode is not supported for this sensor. If other applications
     * registered to batched sensors, the actual number of events that can be batched might be
     * smaller because the hardware FiFo will be partially used to batch the other sensors.
