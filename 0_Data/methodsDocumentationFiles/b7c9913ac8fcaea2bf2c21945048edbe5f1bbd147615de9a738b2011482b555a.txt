     * Implement this method to learn when notifications are removed, how they were interacted with
     * before removal, and why they were removed.
     * <p>
     * This might occur because the user has dismissed the notification using system UI (or another
     * notification listener) or because the app has withdrawn the notification.
     * <p>
     * NOTE: The {@link StatusBarNotification} object you receive will be "light"; that is, the
     * result from {@link StatusBarNotification#getNotification} may be missing some heavyweight
     * fields such as {@link android.app.Notification#contentView} and
     * {@link android.app.Notification#largeIcon}. However, all other fields on
     * {@link StatusBarNotification}, sufficient to match this call with a prior call to
     * {@link #onNotificationPosted(StatusBarNotification)}, will be intact.
     *
     ** @param sbn A data structure encapsulating at least the original information (tag and id)
     *            and source (package name) used to post the {@link android.app.Notification} that
     *            was just removed.
     * @param rankingMap The current ranking map that can be used to retrieve ranking information
     *                   for active notifications.
     * @param stats Stats about how the user interacted with the notification before it was removed.
     * @param reason see {@link #REASON_LISTENER_CANCEL}, etc.
