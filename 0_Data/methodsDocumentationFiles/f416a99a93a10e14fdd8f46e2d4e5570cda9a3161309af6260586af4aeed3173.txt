     * {@inheritDoc}
     *
     * @implSpec
     * This implementation returns a set that subclasses {@link AbstractSet}.
     * The subclass's iterator method returns a "wrapper object" over this
     * map's <tt>entrySet()</tt> iterator.  The <tt>size</tt> method
     * delegates to this map's <tt>size</tt> method and the
     * <tt>contains</tt> method delegates to this map's
     * <tt>containsKey</tt> method.
     *
     * <p>The set is created the first time this method is called,
     * and returned in response to all subsequent calls.  No synchronization
     * is performed, so there is a slight chance that multiple calls to this
     * method will not all return the same set.
