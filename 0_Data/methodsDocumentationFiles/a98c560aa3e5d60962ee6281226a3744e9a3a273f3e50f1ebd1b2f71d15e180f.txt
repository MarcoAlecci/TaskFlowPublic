     * Return a new Context object for the current Context but whose resources
     * are adjusted to match the given Configuration.  Each call to this method
     * returns a new instance of a Context object; Context objects are not
     * shared, however common state (ClassLoader, other Resources for the
     * same configuration) may be so the Context itself can be fairly lightweight.
     *
     * @param overrideConfiguration A {@link Configuration} specifying what
     * values to modify in the base Configuration of the original Context's
     * resources.  If the base configuration changes (such as due to an
     * orientation change), the resources of this context will also change except
     * for those that have been explicitly overridden with a value here.
     *
     * @return A {@link Context} with the given configuration override.
