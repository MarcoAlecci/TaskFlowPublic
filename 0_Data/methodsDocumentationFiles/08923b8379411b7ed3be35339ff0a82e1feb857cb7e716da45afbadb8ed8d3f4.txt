     * This method is deprecated because we want to encourage everyone
     * to use the "?" binding form.  However, when implementing a
     * ContentProvider, one may want to add WHERE clauses that were
     * not provided by the caller.  Since "?" is a positional form,
     * using it in this case could break the caller because the
     * indexes would be shifted to accomodate the ContentProvider's
     * internal bindings.  In that case, it may be necessary to
     * construct a WHERE clause manually.  This method is useful for
     * those cases.
     *
     * @param sb the StringBuilder that the SQL string will be appended to
     * @param sqlString the raw string to be appended, which may contain single
     *                  quotes
