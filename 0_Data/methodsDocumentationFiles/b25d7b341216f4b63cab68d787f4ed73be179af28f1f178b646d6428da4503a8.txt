     * Indicates whether or not this Picture contains recorded commands that only work when
     * drawn to a hardware-accelerated canvas. If this returns true then this Picture can only
     * be drawn to another Picture or to a Canvas where canvas.isHardwareAccelerated() is true.
     *
     * Note this value is only updated after recording has finished by a call to
     * {@link #endRecording()}. Prior to that it will be the default value of false.
     *
     * @return true if the Picture can only be drawn to a hardware-accelerated canvas,
     *         false otherwise.
