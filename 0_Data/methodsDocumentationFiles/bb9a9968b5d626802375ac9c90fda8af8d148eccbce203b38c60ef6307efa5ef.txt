     * Sets whether this AnimationDrawable is visible.
     * <p>
     * When the drawable becomes invisible, it will pause its animation. A subsequent change to
     * visible with <code>restart</code> set to true will restart the animation from the
     * first frame. If <code>restart</code> is false, the drawable will resume from the most recent
     * frame. If the drawable has already reached the last frame, it will then loop back to the
     * first frame, unless it's a one shot drawable (set through {@link #setOneShot(boolean)}),
     * in which case, it will stay on the last frame.
     *
     * @param visible true if visible, false otherwise
     * @param restart when visible, true to force the animation to restart
     *                from the first frame
     * @return true if the new visibility is different than its previous state
