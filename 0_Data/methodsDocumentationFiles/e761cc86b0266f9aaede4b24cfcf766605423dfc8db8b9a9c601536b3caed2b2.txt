     * Direct callback version of {@link #setWindow(int, long, long, PendingIntent)}.  Rather
     * than supplying a PendingIntent to be sent when the alarm time is reached, this variant
     * supplies an {@link OnAlarmListener} instance that will be invoked at that time.
     * <p>
     * The OnAlarmListener {@link OnAlarmListener#onAlarm() onAlarm()} method will be
     * invoked via the specified target Handler, or on the application's main looper
     * if {@code null} is passed as the {@code targetHandler} parameter.
