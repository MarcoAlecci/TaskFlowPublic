     * Remove any statistics parameters from the given {@link Socket}.
     * <p>
     * In Android 8.1 (API level 27) and lower, a socket is automatically
     * untagged when it's sent to another process using binder IPC with a
     * {@code ParcelFileDescriptor} container. In Android 9.0 (API level 28)
     * and higher, the socket tag is kept when the socket is sent to another
     * process using binder IPC. You can mimic the previous behavior by
     * calling {@code untagSocket()} before sending the socket to another
     * process.
