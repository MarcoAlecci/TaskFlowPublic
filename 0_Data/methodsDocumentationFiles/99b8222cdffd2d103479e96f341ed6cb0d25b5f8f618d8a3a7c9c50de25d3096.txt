     * Called as the result of a call to {@link #cancelPendingInputEvents()} on this view or
     * a parent view.
     *
     * <p>This method is responsible for removing any pending high-level input events that were
     * posted to the event queue to run later. Custom view classes that post their own deferred
     * high-level events via {@link #post(Runnable)}, {@link #postDelayed(Runnable, long)} or
     * {@link android.os.Handler} should override this method, call
     * <code>super.onCancelPendingInputEvents()</code> and remove those callbacks as appropriate.
     * </p>
