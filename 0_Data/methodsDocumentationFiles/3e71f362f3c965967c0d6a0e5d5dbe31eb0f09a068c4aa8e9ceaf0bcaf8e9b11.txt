     * Searches the set of signing certificates by which the given package has proven to have been
     * signed.  This should be used instead of {@code getPackageInfo} with {@code GET_SIGNATURES}
     * since it takes into account the possibility of signing certificate rotation, except in the
     * case of packages that are signed by multiple certificates, for which signing certificate
     * rotation is not supported.  This method is analogous to using {@code getPackageInfo} with
     * {@code GET_SIGNING_CERTIFICATES} and then searching through the resulting {@code
     * signingInfo} field to see if the desired certificate is present.
     *
     * @param packageName package whose signing certificates to check
     * @param certificate signing certificate for which to search
     * @param type representation of the {@code certificate}
     * @return true if this package was or is signed by exactly the certificate {@code certificate}
