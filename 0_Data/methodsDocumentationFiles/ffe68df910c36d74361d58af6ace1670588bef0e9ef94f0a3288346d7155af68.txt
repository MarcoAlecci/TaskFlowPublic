         * Set basic description of the kind of network your job requires. If
         * you need more precise control over network capabilities, see
         * {@link #setRequiredNetwork(NetworkRequest)}.
         * <p>
         * If your job doesn't need a network connection, you don't need to call
         * this method, as the default value is {@link #NETWORK_TYPE_NONE}.
         * <p>
         * Calling this method defines network as a strict requirement for your
         * job. If the network requested is not available your job will never
         * run. See {@link #setOverrideDeadline(long)} to change this behavior.
         * Calling this method will override any requirements previously defined
         * by {@link #setRequiredNetwork(NetworkRequest)}; you typically only
         * want to call one of these methods.
         * <p class="note">
         * When your job executes in
         * {@link JobService#onStartJob(JobParameters)}, be sure to use the
         * specific network returned by {@link JobParameters#getNetwork()},
         * otherwise you'll use the default network which may not meet this
         * constraint.
