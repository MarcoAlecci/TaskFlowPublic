     * Turn on the local Bluetooth adapter&mdash;do not use without explicit
     * user action to turn on Bluetooth.
     * <p>This powers on the underlying Bluetooth hardware, and starts all
     * Bluetooth system services.
     * <p class="caution"><strong>Bluetooth should never be enabled without
     * direct user consent</strong>. If you want to turn on Bluetooth in order
     * to create a wireless connection, you should use the {@link
     * #ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE} Intent, which will raise a dialog that requests
     * user permission to turn on Bluetooth. The {@link #enable()} method is
     * provided only for applications that include a user interface for changing
     * system settings, such as a "power manager" app.</p>
     * <p>This is an asynchronous call: it will return immediately, and
     * clients should listen for {@link #ACTION_STATE_CHANGED}
     * to be notified of subsequent adapter state changes. If this call returns
     * true, then the adapter state will immediately transition from {@link
     * #STATE_OFF} to {@link #STATE_TURNING_ON}, and some time
     * later transition to either {@link #STATE_OFF} or {@link
     * #STATE_ON}. If this call returns false then there was an
     * immediate problem that will prevent the adapter from being turned on -
     * such as Airplane mode, or the adapter is already turned on.
     *
     * @return true to indicate adapter startup has begun, or false on immediate error
