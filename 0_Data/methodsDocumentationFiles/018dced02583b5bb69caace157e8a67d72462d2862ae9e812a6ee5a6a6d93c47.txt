         * Returns the start position for time shifting, in milliseconds since the epoch.
         * Returns {@link TvInputManager#TIME_SHIFT_INVALID_TIME} if the position is unknown at the
         * moment.
         *
         * <p>The start position for time shifting indicates the earliest possible time the user can
         * seek to. Initially this is equivalent to the time when the implementation starts
         * recording. Later it may be adjusted because there is insufficient space or the duration
         * of recording is limited by the implementation. The application does not allow the user to
         * seek to a position earlier than the start position.
         *
         * <p>For playback of a recorded program initiated by {@link #onTimeShiftPlay(Uri)}, the
         * start position should be 0 and does not change.
