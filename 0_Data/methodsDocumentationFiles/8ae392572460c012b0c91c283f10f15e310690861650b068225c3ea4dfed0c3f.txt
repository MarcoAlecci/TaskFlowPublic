     * Retrieves the distance in pixels between touches that must be reached for a gesture to be
     * interpreted as scaling.
     *
     * In general, scaling shouldn't start until this distance has been met or surpassed, and
     * scaling should end when the distance in pixels between touches drops below this distance.
     *
     * @return The distance in pixels
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this method is called on a ViewConfiguration that was
     *         instantiated using a constructor with no Context parameter.
