     * Searches the array for the specified value using the binary search algorithm. The array must
     * be sorted (as by the {@link Arrays#sort(int[], int, int)} method) prior to making this call.
     * If it is not sorted, the results are undefined. If the range contains multiple elements with
     * the specified value, there is no guarantee which one will be found.
     *
     * @param value The value to search for.
     * @return index of the search key, if it is contained in the array; otherwise, <i>(-(insertion
     *         point) - 1)</i>. The insertion point is defined as the point at which the key would
     *         be inserted into the array: the index of the first element greater than the key, or
     *         {@link #size()} if all elements in the array are less than the specified key.
     *         Note that this guarantees that the return value will be >= 0 if and only if the key
     *         is found.
