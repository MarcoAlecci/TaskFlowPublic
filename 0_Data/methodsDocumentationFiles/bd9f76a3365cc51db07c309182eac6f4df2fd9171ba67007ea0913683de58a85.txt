     * Adopt the permission identity of the shell UID only for the provided permissions.
     * This allows you to call APIs protected permissions which normal apps cannot hold
     * but are granted to the shell UID. If you already adopted the specified shell
     * permissions by calling this method or {@link #adoptShellPermissionIdentity()} a
     * subsequent call would be a no-op. Note that your permission state becomes that of the
     * shell UID and it is not a combination of your and the shell UID permissions.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:<strong/> Calling this method adopts only the specified shell permissions
     * and overrides all adopted permissions via {@link #adoptShellPermissionIdentity()}.
     *
     * @param permissions The permissions to adopt or <code>null</code> to adopt all.
