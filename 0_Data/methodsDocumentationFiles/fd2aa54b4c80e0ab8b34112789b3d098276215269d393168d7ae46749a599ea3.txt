     * Sets the method for determining Animator start delays.
     * When a Transition affects several Views like {@link android.transition.Explode} or
     * {@link android.transition.Slide}, there may be a desire to have a "wave-front" effect
     * such that the Animator start delay depends on position of the View. The
     * TransitionPropagation specifies how the start delays are calculated.
     * @param transitionPropagation The class used to determine the start delay of
     *                              Animators created by this Transition. A null value
     *                              indicates that no delay should be used.
