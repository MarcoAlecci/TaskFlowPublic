     * Call this to try to give focus to a specific view or to one of its descendants
     * and give it hints about the direction and a specific rectangle that the focus
     * is coming from.  The rectangle can help give larger views a finer grained hint
     * about where focus is coming from, and therefore, where to show selection, or
     * forward focus change internally.
     *
     * A view will not actually take focus if it is not focusable ({@link #isFocusable} returns
     * false), or if it is focusable and it is not focusable in touch mode
     * ({@link #isFocusableInTouchMode}) while the device is in touch mode.
     *
     * A View will not take focus if it is not visible.
     *
     * A View will not take focus if one of its parents has
     * {@link android.view.ViewGroup#getDescendantFocusability()} equal to
     * {@link ViewGroup#FOCUS_BLOCK_DESCENDANTS}.
     *
     * See also {@link #focusSearch(int)}, which is what you call to say that you
     * have focus, and you want your parent to look for the next one.
     *
     * You may wish to override this method if your custom {@link View} has an internal
     * {@link View} that it wishes to forward the request to.
     *
     * @param direction One of FOCUS_UP, FOCUS_DOWN, FOCUS_LEFT, and FOCUS_RIGHT
     * @param previouslyFocusedRect The rectangle (in this View's coordinate system)
     *        to give a finer grained hint about where focus is coming from.  May be null
     *        if there is no hint.
     * @return Whether this view or one of its descendants actually took focus.
