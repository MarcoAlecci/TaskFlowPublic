     * Sets the orientation hint for output video playback.
     * <p>This method should be called before {@link #start}. Calling this
     * method will not rotate the video frame when muxer is generating the file,
     * but add a composition matrix containing the rotation angle in the output
     * video if the output format is
     * {@link OutputFormat#MUXER_OUTPUT_MPEG_4} so that a video player can
     * choose the proper orientation for playback. Note that some video players
     * may choose to ignore the composition matrix in a video during playback.
     * By default, the rotation degree is 0.</p>
     * @param degrees the angle to be rotated clockwise in degrees.
     * The supported angles are 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if degree is not supported.
     * @throws IllegalStateException If this method is called after {@link #start}.
