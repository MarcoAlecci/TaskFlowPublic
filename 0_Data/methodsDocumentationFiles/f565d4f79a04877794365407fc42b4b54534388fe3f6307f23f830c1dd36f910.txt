     * <p class="note">Be careful about how you use this.  All this tells you is
     * who created the PendingIntent.  It does <strong>not</strong> tell you who
     * handed the PendingIntent to you: that is, PendingIntent objects are intended to be
     * passed between applications, so the PendingIntent you receive from an application
     * could actually be one it received from another application, meaning the result
     * you get here will identify the original application.  Because of this, you should
     * only use this information to identify who you expect to be interacting with
     * through a {@link #send} call, not who gave you the PendingIntent.</p>
