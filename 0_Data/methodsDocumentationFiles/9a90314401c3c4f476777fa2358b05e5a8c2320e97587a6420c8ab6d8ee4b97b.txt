     * Returns true if the current IME needs to offer the users ways to switch to a next input
     * method (e.g. a globe key.).
     * When an IME sets supportsSwitchingToNextInputMethod and this method returns true,
     * the IME has to offer ways to to invoke {@link #switchToNextInputMethod} accordingly.
     * <p> Note that the system determines the most appropriate next input method
     * and subtype in order to provide the consistent user experience in switching
     * between IMEs and subtypes.
     * @param imeToken Supplies the identifying token given to an input method when it was started,
     * which allows it to perform this operation on itself.
     * @deprecated Use {@link InputMethodService#shouldOfferSwitchingToNextInputMethod()}
     * instead. This method was intended for IME developers who should be accessing APIs through
     * the service. APIs in this class are intended for app developers interacting with the IME.
