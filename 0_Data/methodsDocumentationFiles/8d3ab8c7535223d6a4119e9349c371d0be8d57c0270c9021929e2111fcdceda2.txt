         * Returns the primaries of this color space as a new array of 6 floats.
         * The Y component is assumed to be 1 and is therefore not copied into
         * the destination. The x and y components of the first primary are
         * written in the array at positions 0 and 1 respectively.
         *
         * <p>Note: Some ColorSpaces represent gray profiles. The concept of
         * primaries for such a ColorSpace does not make sense, so we use a special
         * set of primaries that are all 1s.</p>
