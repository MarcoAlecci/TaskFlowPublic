     * The description of the package whose data will be delivered is provided, as well as
     * the socket file descriptor on which the transport will receive the data itself.
     *
     * <p>If the package is not eligible for backup, the transport should return
     * {@link BackupTransport#TRANSPORT_PACKAGE_REJECTED}.  In this case the system will
     * simply proceed with the next candidate if any, or finish the full backup operation
     * if all apps have been processed.
     *
     * <p>After the transport returns {@link BackupTransport#TRANSPORT_OK} from this
     * method, the OS will proceed to call {@link #sendBackupData()} one or more times
     * to deliver the application's data as a streamed tarball.  The transport should not
     * read() from the socket except as instructed to via the {@link #sendBackupData(int)}
     * method.
     *
     * <p>After all data has been delivered to the transport, the system will call
     * {@link #finishBackup()}.  At this point the transport should commit the data to
     * its datastore, if appropriate, and close the socket that had been provided in
     * {@link #performFullBackup(PackageInfo, ParcelFileDescriptor)}.
     *
     * <p class="note">If the transport returns TRANSPORT_OK from this method, then the
     * OS will always provide a matching call to {@link #finishBackup()} even if sending
     * data via {@link #sendBackupData(int)} failed at some point.
     *
     * @param targetPackage The package whose data is to follow.
     * @param socket The socket file descriptor through which the data will be provided.
     *    If the transport returns {@link #TRANSPORT_PACKAGE_REJECTED} here, it must still
     *    close this file descriptor now; otherwise it should be cached for use during
     *    succeeding calls to {@link #sendBackupData(int)}, and closed in response to
     *    {@link #finishBackup()}.
     * @param flags {@link BackupTransport#FLAG_USER_INITIATED} or 0.
     * @return TRANSPORT_PACKAGE_REJECTED to indicate that the stated application is not
     *    to be backed up; TRANSPORT_OK to indicate that the OS may proceed with delivering
     *    backup data; TRANSPORT_ERROR to indicate a fatal error condition that precludes
     *    performing a backup at this time.
