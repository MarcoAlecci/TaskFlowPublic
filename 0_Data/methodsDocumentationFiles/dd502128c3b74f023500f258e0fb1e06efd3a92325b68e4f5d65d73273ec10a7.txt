     * The default implementation of this method calls
     * {@link #onAppear(ViewGroup, View, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}.
     * Subclasses should override this method or
     * {@link #onAppear(ViewGroup, View, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}.
     * if they need to create an Animator when targets appear.
     * The method should only be called by the Visibility class; it is
     * not intended to be called from external classes.
     *
