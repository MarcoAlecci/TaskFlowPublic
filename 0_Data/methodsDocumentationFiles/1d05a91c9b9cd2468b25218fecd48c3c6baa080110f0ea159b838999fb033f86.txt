     * <p>A user that is affiliated with the device owner user is considered to be
     * affiliated with the device.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Features that depend on user affiliation (such as security logging
     * or {@link #bindDeviceAdminServiceAsUser}) won't be available when a secondary user
     * is created, until it becomes affiliated. Therefore it is recommended that the appropriate
     * affiliation ids are set by its owner as soon as possible after the user is
     * created.
     * <p>
     * Note: This method used to be available for affiliating device owner and profile
     * owner. However, since Android 11, this combination is not possible. This method is now
     * only useful for affiliating the primary user with managed secondary users.
     *
     * @param admin Which device owner, or owner of secondary user, this request is associated with.
     * @param ids A set of opaque non-empty affiliation ids.
