     * Scenes that are not defined with layout resources or
     * hierarchies, or which need to perform additional steps
     * after those hierarchies are changed to, should set an enter
     * action, and possibly an exit action as well. An exit action
     * will cause Scene to call back into application code to do
     * anything the application needs to do after applicable transitions have
     * captured pre-change values, but before any other scene changes
     * have been applied, such as the new layout (if any) being added to
     * the view hierarchy. After this method is called, the next scene
     * will be entered, including a call to {@link #setEnterAction(Runnable)}
     * if an enter action is set.
