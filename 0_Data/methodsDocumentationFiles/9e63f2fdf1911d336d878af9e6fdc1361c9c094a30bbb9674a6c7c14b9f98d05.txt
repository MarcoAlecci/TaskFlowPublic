     * Returns {@code true} if the key is authorized to be used only for messages confirmed by the
     * user.
     *
     * Confirmation is separate from user authentication (see
     * {@link Builder#setUserAuthenticationRequired(boolean)}). Keys can be created that require
     * confirmation but not user authentication, or user authentication but not confirmation, or
     * both. Confirmation verifies that some user with physical possession of the device has
     * approved a displayed message. User authentication verifies that the correct user is present
     * and has authenticated.
     *
     * <p>This authorization applies only to secret key and private key operations. Public key
     * operations are not restricted.
