         * Returns the total time the timer has been active, if it is being tracked.
         *
         * Returns the total cumulative duration (i.e. sum of past durations) that this timer has
         * been on since reset.
         * This may differ from getTotalTimeLocked(elapsedRealtimeUs, STATS_SINCE_CHARGED)/1000 since,
         * depending on the Timer, getTotalTimeLocked may represent the total 'blamed' or 'pooled'
         * time, rather than the actual time. By contrast, getTotalDurationMsLocked always gives
         * the actual total time.
         * Not all Timer subclasses track the max, total, and current durations.
