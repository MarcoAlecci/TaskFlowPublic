     * Get current playback position as a {@link MediaTimestamp}.
     * <p>
     * The MediaTimestamp represents how the media time correlates to the system time in
     * a linear fashion using an anchor and a clock rate. During regular playback, the media
     * time moves fairly constantly (though the anchor frame may be rebased to a current
     * system time, the linear correlation stays steady). Therefore, this method does not
     * need to be called often.
     * <p>
     * To help users get current playback position, this method always anchors the timestamp
     * to the current {@link System#nanoTime system time}, so
     * {@link MediaTimestamp#getAnchorMediaTimeUs} can be used as current playback position.
     *
     * @return a MediaTimestamp object if a timestamp is available, or {@code null} if no timestamp
     *         is available, e.g. because the media player has not been initialized.
