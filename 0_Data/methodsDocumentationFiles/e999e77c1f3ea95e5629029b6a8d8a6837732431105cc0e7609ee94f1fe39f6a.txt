     * Indicates whether this rational represents a finite value.
     *
     * <p>A finite value occurs when the denominator is not {@code 0}; in other words
     * the rational is neither infinity or {@code NaN}.</p>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if this rational is a (positive or negative) infinite value;
     *         {@code false} if this is a finite number value (or {@code NaN})
