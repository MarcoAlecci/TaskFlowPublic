         * This method is called instead of {@link #onCaptureCompleted} when the
         * camera device failed to produce a {@link CaptureResult} for the
         * request.
         *
         * <p>Other requests are unaffected, and some or all image buffers from
         * the capture may have been pushed to their respective output
         * streams.</p>
         *
         * <p>The default implementation of this method does nothing.</p>
         *
         * @param session
         *            The session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
         * @param request
         *            The request that was given to the CameraDevice
         * @param failure
         *            The output failure from the capture, including the failure reason
         *            and the frame number.
