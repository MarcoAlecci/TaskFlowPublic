     * Compares this {@code LinkAddress} instance against {@code obj}. Two addresses are equal if
     * their address, prefix length, flags and scope are equal. Thus, for example, two addresses
     * that have the same address and prefix length are not equal if one of them is deprecated and
     * the other is not.
     *
     * @param obj the object to be tested for equality.
     * @return {@code true} if both objects are equal, {@code false} otherwise.
