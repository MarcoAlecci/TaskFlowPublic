     * <p>Whenever a request has been processed, regardless of failure or success,
     * it gets a unique frame number assigned to its future result/failure.</p>
     *
     * <p>For the same type of request (capturing from the camera device or reprocessing), this
     * value monotonically increments, starting with 0, for every new result or failure and the
     * scope is the lifetime of the {@link CameraDevice}. Between different types of requests,
     * the frame number may not monotonically increment. For example, the frame number of a newer
     * reprocess result may be smaller than the frame number of an older result of capturing new
     * images from the camera device, but the frame number of a newer reprocess result will never be
     * smaller than the frame number of an older reprocess result.</p>
