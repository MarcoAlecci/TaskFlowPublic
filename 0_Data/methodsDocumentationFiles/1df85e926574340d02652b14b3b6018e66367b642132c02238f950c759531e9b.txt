     * 1. If captioning is disabled, only consider FORCED tracks. Otherwise,
     * consider all tracks, but prefer non-FORCED ones.
     * 2. If user selected "Default" caption language:
     *   a. If there is a considered track with DEFAULT=yes, returns that track
     *      (favor the first one in the current language if there are more than
     *      one default tracks, or the first in general if none of them are in
     *      the current language).
     *   b. Otherwise, if there is a track with AUTOSELECT=yes in the current
     *      language, return that one.
     *   c. If there are no default tracks, and no autoselectable tracks in the
     *      current language, return null.
     * 3. If there is a track with the caption language, select that one.  Prefer
     * the one with AUTOSELECT=no.
     *
     * The default values for these flags are DEFAULT=no, AUTOSELECT=yes
     * and FORCED=no.
