     * Converts a complex data value holding a dimension to its final value
     * as an integer pixel size.  This is the same as
     * {@link #complexToDimension}, except the raw floating point value is
     * converted to an integer (pixel) value for use as a size.  A size
     * conversion involves rounding the base value, and ensuring that a
     * non-zero base value is at least one pixel in size.
     * The given <var>data</var> must be structured as a 
     * {@link #TYPE_DIMENSION}.
     *  
     * @param data A complex data value holding a unit, magnitude, and 
     *             mantissa.
     * @param metrics Current display metrics to use in the conversion -- 
     *                supplies display density and scaling information.
     * 
     * @return The number of pixels specified by the data and its desired
     * multiplier and units.
