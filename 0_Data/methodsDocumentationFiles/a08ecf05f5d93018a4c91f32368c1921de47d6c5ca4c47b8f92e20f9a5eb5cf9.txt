     * Add a fixed view to appear at the bottom of the list. If addFooterView is
     * called more than once, the views will appear in the order they were
     * added. Views added using this call can take focus if they want.
     * <p>
     * Note: When first introduced, this method could only be called before
     * setting the adapter with {@link #setAdapter(ListAdapter)}. Starting with
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, this method may be
     * called at any time. If the ListView's adapter does not extend
     * {@link HeaderViewListAdapter}, it will be wrapped with a supporting
     * instance of {@link WrapperListAdapter}.
     *
     * @param v The view to add.
