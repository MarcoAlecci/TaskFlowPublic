     * Specifies whether the screen should be turned on when the {@link Activity} is resumed.
     * Normally an activity will be transitioned to the stopped state if it is started while the
     * screen if off, but with this flag set the activity will cause the screen to turn on if the
     * activity will be visible and resumed due to the screen coming on. The screen will not be
     * turned on if the activity won't be visible after the screen is turned on. This flag is
     * normally used in conjunction with the {@link android.R.attr#showWhenLocked} flag to make sure
     * the activity is visible after the screen is turned on when the lockscreen is up. In addition,
     * if this flag is set and the activity calls {@link
     * KeyguardManager#requestDismissKeyguard(Activity, KeyguardManager.KeyguardDismissCallback)}
     * the screen will turn on.
     *
     * @param turnScreenOn {@code true} to turn on the screen; {@code false} otherwise.
