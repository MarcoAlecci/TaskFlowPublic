     * <p>This corresponds to {@link Activity#onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)
     * Activity.onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} and most of the discussion there
     * applies here as well.  Note however: <em>this method may be called
     * at any time before {@link #onDestroy()}</em>.  There are many situations
     * where a fragment may be mostly torn down (such as when placed on the
     * back stack with no UI showing), but its state will not be saved until
     * its owning activity actually needs to save its state.
