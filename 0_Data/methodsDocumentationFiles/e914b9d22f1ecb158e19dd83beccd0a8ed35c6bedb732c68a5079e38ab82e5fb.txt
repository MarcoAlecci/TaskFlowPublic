         * From Android 11, messaging notifications (those that use {@link MessagingStyle}) that
         * use this method to link to a published long-lived sharing shortcut may appear in a
         * dedicated Conversation section of the shade and may show configuration options that
         * are unique to conversations. This behavior should be reserved for person to person(s)
         * conversations where there is a likely social obligation for an individual to respond.
         * <p>
         * For example, the following are some examples of notifications that belong in the
         * conversation space:
         * <ul>
         * <li>1:1 conversations between two individuals</li>
         * <li>Group conversations between individuals where everyone can contribute</li>
         * </ul>
         * And the following are some examples of notifications that do not belong in the
         * conversation space:
         * <ul>
         * <li>Advertisements from a bot (even if personal and contextualized)</li>
         * <li>Engagement notifications from a bot</li>
         * <li>Directional conversations where there is an active speaker and many passive
         * individuals</li>
         * <li>Stream / posting updates from other individuals</li>
         * <li>Email, document comments, or other conversation types that are not real-time</li>
         * </ul>
         * </p>
         *
         * <p>
         * Additionally, this method can be used for all types of notifications to mark this
         * notification as duplicative of a Launcher shortcut. Launchers that show badges or
         * notification content may then suppress the shortcut in favor of the content of this
         * notification.
         * <p>
         * If this notification has {@link BubbleMetadata} attached that was created with
         * a shortcutId a check will be performed to ensure the shortcutId supplied to bubble
         * metadata matches the shortcutId set here, if one was set. If the shortcutId's were
         * specified but do not match, an exception is thrown.
         *
         * @param shortcutId the {@link ShortcutInfo#getId() id} of the shortcut this notification
         *                   is linked to
         *
         * @see BubbleMetadata.Builder#Builder(String)
