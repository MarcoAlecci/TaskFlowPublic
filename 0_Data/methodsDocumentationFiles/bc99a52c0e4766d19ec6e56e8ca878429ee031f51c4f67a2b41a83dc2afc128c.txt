     * Get the {@link NdefMessage} that was read from the tag at discovery time.
     *
     * <p>If the NDEF Message is modified by an I/O operation then it
     * will not be updated here, this function only returns what was discovered
     * when the tag entered the field.
     * <p>Note that this method may return null if the tag was in the
     * INITIALIZED state as defined by NFC Forum, as in this state the
     * tag is formatted to support NDEF but does not contain a message yet.
     * <p>Does not cause any RF activity and does not block.
     * @return NDEF Message read from the tag at discovery time, can be null
