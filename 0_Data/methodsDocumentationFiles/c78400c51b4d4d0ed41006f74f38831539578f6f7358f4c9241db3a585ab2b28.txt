     * Remove all preferred activity mappings, previously added with
     * {@link #addPreferredActivity}, from the
     * system whose activities are implemented in the given package name.
     * An application can only clear its own package(s).
     *
     * @param packageName The name of the package whose preferred activity
     * mappings are to be removed.
     *
     * @deprecated This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
     * responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
     * directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
     * {@link #resolveActivity} or {@link #queryIntentActivities}. To configure
     * an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
     * holders, see {@link android.app.role.RoleManager}.
