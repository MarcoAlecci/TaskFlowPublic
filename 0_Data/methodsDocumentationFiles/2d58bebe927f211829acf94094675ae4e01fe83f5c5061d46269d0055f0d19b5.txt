     * Returns the absolute path to the directory on the filesystem where all
     * private files belonging to this app are stored. Apps should not use this
     * path directly; they should instead use {@link #getFilesDir()},
     * {@link #getCacheDir()}, {@link #getDir(String, int)}, or other storage
     * APIs on this class.
     * <p>
     * The returned path may change over time if the calling app is moved to an
     * adopted storage device, so only relative paths should be persisted.
     * <p>
     * No additional permissions are required for the calling app to read or
     * write files under the returned path.
