     * Report a fatal XML parsing error.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation throws a SAXParseException.
     * Application writers may override this method in a subclass if
     * they need to take specific actions for each fatal error (such as
     * collecting all of the errors into a single report): in any case,
     * the application must stop all regular processing when this
     * method is invoked, since the document is no longer reliable, and
     * the parser may no longer report parsing events.</p>
     *
     * @param e The error information encoded as an exception.
     * @exception org.xml.sax.SAXException Any SAX exception, possibly
     *            wrapping another exception.
     * @see org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler#fatalError
