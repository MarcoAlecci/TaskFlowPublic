     * <p>Returns a hexadecimal string representation of the specified half-precision
     * float value. If the value is a NaN, the result is <code>"NaN"</code>,
     * otherwise the result follows this format:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the sign is positive, no sign character appears in the result</li>
     * <li>If the sign is negative, the first character is <code>'-'</code></li>
     * <li>If the value is inifinity, the string is <code>"Infinity"</code></li>
     * <li>If the value is 0, the string is <code>"0x0.0p0"</code></li>
     * <li>If the value has a normalized representation, the exponent and
     * significand are represented in the string in two fields. The significand
     * starts with <code>"0x1."</code> followed by its lowercase hexadecimal
     * representation. Trailing zeroes are removed unless all digits are 0, then
     * a single zero is used. The significand representation is followed by the
     * exponent, represented by <code>"p"</code>, itself followed by a decimal
     * string of the unbiased exponent</li>
     * <li>If the value has a subnormal representation, the significand starts
     * with <code>"0x0."</code> followed by its lowercase hexadecimal
     * representation. Trailing zeroes are removed unless all digits are 0, then
     * a single zero is used. The significand representation is followed by the
     * exponent, represented by <code>"p-14"</code></li>
     * </ul>

     * @param h A half-precision float value
