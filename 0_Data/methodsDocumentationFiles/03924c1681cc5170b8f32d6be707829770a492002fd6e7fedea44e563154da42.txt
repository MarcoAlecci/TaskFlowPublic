     * <p></p>Return a list of the tasks that the user has recently launched, with
     * the most recent being first and older ones after in order.
     *
     * <p><b>Note: this method is only intended for debugging and presenting
     * task management user interfaces</b>.  This should never be used for
     * core logic in an application, such as deciding between different
     * behaviors based on the information found here.  Such uses are
     * <em>not</em> supported, and will likely break in the future.  For
     * example, if multiple applications can be actively running at the
     * same time, assumptions made about the meaning of the data here for
     * purposes of control flow will be incorrect.</p>
     *
     * @deprecated As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP}, this method is
     * no longer available to third party applications: the introduction of
     * document-centric recents means
     * it can leak personal information to the caller.  For backwards compatibility,
     * it will still return a small subset of its data: at least the caller's
     * own tasks (though see {@link #getAppTasks()} for the correct supported
     * way to retrieve that information), and possibly some other tasks
     * such as home that are known to not be sensitive.
     *
     * @param maxNum The maximum number of entries to return in the list.  The
     * actual number returned may be smaller, depending on how many tasks the
     * user has started and the maximum number the system can remember.
     * @param flags Information about what to return.  May be any combination
     * of {@link #RECENT_WITH_EXCLUDED} and {@link #RECENT_IGNORE_UNAVAILABLE}.
     *
     * @return Returns a list of RecentTaskInfo records describing each of
     * the recent tasks.
