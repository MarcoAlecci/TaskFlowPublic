     * Compare the signatures of two packages to determine if the same
     * signature appears in both of them.  If they do contain the same
     * signature, then they are allowed special privileges when working
     * with each other: they can share the same user-id, run instrumentation
     * against each other, etc.
     *
     * @param packageName1 First package name whose signature will be compared.
     * @param packageName2 Second package name whose signature will be compared.
     *
     * @return Returns an integer indicating whether all signatures on the
     * two packages match. The value is >= 0 ({@link #SIGNATURE_MATCH}) if
     * all signatures match or < 0 if there is not a match ({@link
     * #SIGNATURE_NO_MATCH} or {@link #SIGNATURE_UNKNOWN_PACKAGE}).
