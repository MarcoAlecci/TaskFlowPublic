     * OEM information element parser for security types not parsed by the framework.
     *
     * The OEM method should use the method inputs {@code id}, {@code idExt}, and {@code bytes}
     * to perform the parsing. The method should place the results in an OemSecurityType objct.
     *
     * @param id The information element id.
     * @param idExt The information element extension id. This is valid only when id is
     *        the extension id, {@code 255}.
     * @param bytes The raw bytes of information element data, 'Element ID' and 'Length' are
     *              stripped off already.
     * @return an OemSecurityType object if this IE is parsed successfully, null otherwise.
