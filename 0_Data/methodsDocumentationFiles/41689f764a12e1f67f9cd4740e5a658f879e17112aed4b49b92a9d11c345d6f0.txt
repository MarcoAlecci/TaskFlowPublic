     * behavior of the widget based on the state of the app (for e.g., if the user is logged in

     *
     * <p>
     * The manifest entry of the provider should contain an additional meta-data tag similar to
     * {@link #META_DATA_APPWIDGET_PROVIDER} which should point to any alternative definitions for
     * the provider.
     *
     * <p>
     * This is persisted across device reboots and app updates. If this meta-data key is not
     * present in the manifest entry, the info reverts to default.
     *
     * @param provider {@link ComponentName} for the {@link
     *    android.content.BroadcastReceiver BroadcastReceiver} provider for your AppWidget.
     * @param metaDataKey key for the meta-data tag pointing to the new provider info. Use null
     *    to reset any previously set info.
