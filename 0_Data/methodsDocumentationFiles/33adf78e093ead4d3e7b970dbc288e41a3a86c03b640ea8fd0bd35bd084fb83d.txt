     * {@link android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService}. When set by
     * a device owner or profile owner the restriction applies to all profiles of the user the
     * device owner or profile owner is an admin for. By default, the user can use any accessibility
     * service. When zero or more packages have been added, accessibility services that are not in
     * the list and not part of the system can not be enabled by the user.
     * <p>
     * Calling with a null value for the list disables the restriction so that all services can be
     * used, calling with an empty list only allows the built-in system services. Any non-system
     * accessibility service that's currently enabled must be included in the list.
     * <p>
     * System accessibility services are always available to the user and this method can't
     * disable them.
