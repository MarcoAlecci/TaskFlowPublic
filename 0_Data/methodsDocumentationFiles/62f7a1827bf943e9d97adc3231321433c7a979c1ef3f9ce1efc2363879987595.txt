     * Add a new preferred activity mapping to the system.  This will be used
     * to automatically select the given activity component when
     * {@link Context#startActivity(Intent) Context.startActivity()} finds
     * multiple matching activities and also matches the given filter.
     *
     * @param filter The set of intents under which this activity will be
     * made preferred.
     * @param match The IntentFilter match category that this preference
     * applies to.
     * @param set The set of activities that the user was picking from when
     * this preference was made.
     * @param activity The component name of the activity that is to be
     * preferred.
     *
     * @deprecated This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
     * responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
     * directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
     * {@link #resolveActivity} or {@link #queryIntentActivities}. To configure
     * an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
     * holders, see {@link android.app.role.RoleManager}.
