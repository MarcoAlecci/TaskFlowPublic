     * Gets information about currently inserted UICCs and eUICCs.
     * <p>
     * Requires that the calling app has carrier privileges (see {@link #hasCarrierPrivileges}).
     * <p>
     * If the caller has carrier priviliges on any active subscription, then they have permission to
     * get simple information like the card ID ({@link UiccCardInfo#getCardId()}), whether the card
     * is an eUICC ({@link UiccCardInfo#isEuicc()}), and the slot index where the card is inserted
     * ({@link UiccCardInfo#getSlotIndex()}).
     * <p>
     * To get private information such as the EID ({@link UiccCardInfo#getEid()}) or ICCID
     * ({@link UiccCardInfo#getIccId()}), the caller must have carrier priviliges on that specific
     * UICC or eUICC card.
     * <p>
     * See {@link UiccCardInfo} for more details on the kind of information available.
     *
     * @return a list of UiccCardInfo objects, representing information on the currently inserted
     * UICCs and eUICCs. Each UiccCardInfo in the list will have private information filtered out if
     * the caller does not have adequate permissions for that card.
