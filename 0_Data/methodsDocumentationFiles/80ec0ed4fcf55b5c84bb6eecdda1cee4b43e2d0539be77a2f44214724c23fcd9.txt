     * Picks a start position for {@link Cursor#fillWindow} such that the
     * window will contain the requested row and a useful range of rows
     * around it.
     *
     * When the data set is too large to fit in a cursor window, seeking the
     * cursor can become a very expensive operation since we have to run the
     * query again when we move outside the bounds of the current window.
     *
     * We try to choose a start position for the cursor window such that
     * 1/3 of the window's capacity is used to hold rows before the requested
     * position and 2/3 of the window's capacity is used to hold rows after the
     * requested position.
     *
     * @param cursorPosition The row index of the row we want to get.
     * @param cursorWindowCapacity The estimated number of rows that can fit in
     * a cursor window, or 0 if unknown.
     * @return The recommended start position, always less than or equal to
     * the requested row.
     * @hide
