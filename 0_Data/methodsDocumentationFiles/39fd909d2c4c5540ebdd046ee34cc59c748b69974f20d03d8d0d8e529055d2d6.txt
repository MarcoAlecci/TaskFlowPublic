     * Sets the Transition that will be used to move Views out of the scene when the
     * fragment is removed, hidden, or detached when not popping the back stack.
     * The exiting Views will be those that are regular Views or ViewGroups that
     * have {@link ViewGroup#isTransitionGroup} return true. Typical Transitions will extend
     * {@link android.transition.Visibility} as exiting is governed by changing visibility
     * from {@link View#VISIBLE} to {@link View#INVISIBLE}. If transition is null, the views will
     * remain unaffected.
