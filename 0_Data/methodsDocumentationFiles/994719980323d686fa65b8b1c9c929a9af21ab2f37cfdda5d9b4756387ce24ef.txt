     * <p class="caution"><strong>Note:</strong> Scheduling a job can have a high cost, even if it's
     * rescheduling the same job and the job didn't execute, especially on platform versions before
     * version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}. As such, the system may throttle calls to
     * this API if calls are made too frequently in a short amount of time.

     * @param job The job you wish scheduled. See
     * {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder JobInfo.Builder} for more detail on the sorts of jobs
