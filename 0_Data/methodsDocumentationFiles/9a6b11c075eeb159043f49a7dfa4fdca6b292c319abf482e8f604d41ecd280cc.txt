         * Updates the current recorded values. These are meant to be monotonically increasing
         * and cumulative. If you are dealing with deltas, use {@link #add(long, int)}.
         *
         * If the values being recorded have been reset, the monotonically increasing requirement
         * will be broken. In this case, {@link #endSample()} is automatically called and
         * the total value of totalTime and count are recorded, starting a new monotonically
         * increasing sample.
         *
         * @param totalTime total time of sample in microseconds.
         * @param count total number of times the event being sampled occurred.
