     * Return documents that match the given query under the requested
     * root. The returned documents should be sorted by relevance in descending
     * order. How documents are matched against the query string is an
     * implementation detail left to each provider, but it's suggested that at
     * least {@link Document#COLUMN_DISPLAY_NAME} be matched in a
     * case-insensitive fashion.
     * <p>
     * If your provider is cloud-based, and you have some data cached or pinned
     * locally, you may return the local data immediately, setting
     * {@link DocumentsContract#EXTRA_LOADING} on the Cursor to indicate that
     * you are still fetching additional data. Then, when the network data is
     * available, you can send a change notification to trigger a requery and
     * return the complete contents.
     * <p>
     * To support change notifications, you must
     * {@link Cursor#setNotificationUri(ContentResolver, Uri)} with a relevant
     * Uri, such as {@link DocumentsContract#buildSearchDocumentsUri(String,
     * String, String)}. Then you can call {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(Uri,
     * android.database.ContentObserver, boolean)} with that Uri to send change
     * notifications.
     *
     * @param rootId the root to search under.
     * @param projection list of {@link Document} columns to put into the
     *            cursor. If {@code null} all supported columns should be
     *            included.
     * @param queryArgs the query arguments.
     *            {@link DocumentsContract#QUERY_ARG_EXCLUDE_MEDIA},
     *            {@link DocumentsContract#QUERY_ARG_DISPLAY_NAME},
     *            {@link DocumentsContract#QUERY_ARG_MIME_TYPES},
     *            {@link DocumentsContract#QUERY_ARG_FILE_SIZE_OVER},
     *            {@link DocumentsContract#QUERY_ARG_LAST_MODIFIED_AFTER}.
     * @return cursor containing search result. Include
     *         {@link ContentResolver#EXTRA_HONORED_ARGS} in {@link Cursor}
     *         extras {@link Bundle} when any QUERY_ARG_* value was honored
     *         during the preparation of the results.
