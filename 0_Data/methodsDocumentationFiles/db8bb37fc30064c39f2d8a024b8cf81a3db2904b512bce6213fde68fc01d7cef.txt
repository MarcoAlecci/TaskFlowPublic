     * Handles drag events sent by the system following a call to
     * {@link android.view.View#startDragAndDrop(ClipData,DragShadowBuilder,Object,int)
     * startDragAndDrop()}.
     *<p>
     * When the system calls this method, it passes a
     * {@link android.view.DragEvent} object. A call to
     * {@link android.view.DragEvent#getAction()} returns one of the action type constants defined
     * in DragEvent. The method uses these to determine what is happening in the drag and drop
     * operation.
     * @param event The {@link android.view.DragEvent} sent by the system.
     * The {@link android.view.DragEvent#getAction()} method returns an action type constant defined
     * in DragEvent, indicating the type of drag event represented by this object.
     * @return {@code true} if the method was successful, otherwise {@code false}.
     * <p>
     *  The method should return {@code true} in response to an action type of
     *  {@link android.view.DragEvent#ACTION_DRAG_STARTED} to receive drag events for the current
     *  operation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *  The method should also return {@code true} in response to an action type of
     *  {@link android.view.DragEvent#ACTION_DROP} if it consumed the drop, or
     *  {@code false} if it didn't.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *  For all other events, the return value is ignored.
     * </p>
