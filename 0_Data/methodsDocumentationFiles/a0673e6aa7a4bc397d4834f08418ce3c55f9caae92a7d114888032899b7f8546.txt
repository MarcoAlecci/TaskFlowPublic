     * Retrieves the connection start time of the {@link Connection}, if specified.  A value of
     * {@link Conference#CONNECT_TIME_NOT_SPECIFIED} indicates that Telecom should determine the
     * start time of the connection.
     * <p>
     * Based on the value of {@link SystemClock#elapsedRealtime()}, which ensures that wall-clock
     * changes do not impact the call duration.

     * Used internally in Telephony when migrating conference participant data for IMS conferences.
     * <p>
     * The value returned is the same one set using
     * {@link #setConnectionStartElapsedRealtimeMillis(long)}.  This value is never updated from
     * the Telecom framework, so no permission enforcement occurs when retrieving the value with
     * this method.
     *
     * @return The time at which the {@link Connection} was connected.
