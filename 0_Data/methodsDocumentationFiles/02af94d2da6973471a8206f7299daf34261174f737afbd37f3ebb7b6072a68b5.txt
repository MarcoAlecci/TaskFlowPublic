     * This hook is called whenever an item in a context menu is selected. The
     * default implementation simply returns false to have the normal processing
     * happen (calling the item's Runnable or sending a message to its Handler
     * as appropriate). You can use this method for any items for which you
     * would like to do processing without those other facilities.
     * <p>
     * Use {@link MenuItem#getMenuInfo()} to get extra information set by the
     * View that added this menu item.
     * <p>
     * Derived classes should call through to the base class for it to perform
     * the default menu handling.
     *
     * @param item The context menu item that was selected.
     * @return boolean Return false to allow normal context menu processing to
     *         proceed, true to consume it here.
