     * Opens the proc file and buffers all its content, which can be traversed through a
     * ProcFileIterator.
     *
     * This method will tolerate at most 5 errors. After that, it will always return null. This is
     * to save resources and to prevent log spam.
     *
     * This method is thread-safe. It first checks if there are other threads holding read/write
     * lock. If there are, it assumes data is fresh and reuses the data.
     *
     * A read lock is automatically acquired when a valid ProcFileIterator is returned. Caller MUST
     * call {@link ProcFileIterator#close()} when it is done to release the lock.
     *
     * @param ignoreCache If true, ignores the cache and refreshes the data anyway.
     * @return A {@link ProcFileIterator} to iterate through the file content, or null if there is
     * error.
