     * Determine whether the calling process of an IPC <em>or you</em> has been granted
     * permission to access a specific URI.  This is the same as
     * {@link #checkCallingUriPermission}, except it grants your own permissions
     * if you are not currently processing an IPC.  Use with care!
     *
     * @param uri The uri that is being checked.
     * @param modeFlags The access modes to check.
     *
     * @return {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_GRANTED} if the caller
     * is allowed to access that uri, or
     * {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_DENIED} if it is not.
