     * emergency number based on current locale, SIM card(s), Android database, modem, network,
     * or defaults.

     * numbers are not considered emergency numbers. A dialable phone number consists only
     * of characters/digits identified by {@link PhoneNumberUtils#isDialable(char)}.
     *
     * <p>The subscriptions which the identification would be based on, are all the active
     * subscriptions, no matter which subscription could be used to create TelephonyManager.
     *
     * @param number - the number to look up
     * @return {@code true} if the given number is an emergency number based on current locale,
     * SIM card(s), Android database, modem, network or defaults; {@code false} otherwise.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the Telephony process is not currently available.
