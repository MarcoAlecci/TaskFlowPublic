     * Gets the difference between hardware clock ({@link #getTimeInNs()}) inside GPS receiver and
     * the true GPS time since 0000Z, January 6, 1980, in nanoseconds.
     *
     * This value is available if {@link #TYPE_LOCAL_HW_TIME} is set, and GPS receiver has solved
     * the clock for GPS time.
     * {@link #getBiasUncertaintyInNs()} should be used for quality check.
     *
     * The sign of the value is defined by the following equation:
     *      true time (GPS time) = time_ns + (full_bias_ns + bias_ns)
     *
     * The reported full bias includes {@link #getBiasUncertaintyInNs()}.
     * The value is onl available if {@link #hasFullBiasInNs()} is true.
