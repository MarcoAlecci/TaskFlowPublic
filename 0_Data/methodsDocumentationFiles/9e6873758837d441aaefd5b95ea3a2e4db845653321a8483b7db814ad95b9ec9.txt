     * Legacy version of drawBitmap(int[] colors, ...) that took ints for x,y
     *
     * @deprecated Usage with a {@link #isHardwareAccelerated() hardware accelerated} canvas
     *             requires an internal copy of color buffer contents every time this method is
     *             called. Using a Bitmap avoids this copy, and allows the application to more
     *             explicitly control the lifetime and copies of pixel data.
