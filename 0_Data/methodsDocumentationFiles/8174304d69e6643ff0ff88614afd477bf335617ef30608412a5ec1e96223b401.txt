     * Returns the number of elements in this queue.  If this queue
     * contains more than {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} elements, returns
     * {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
     *
     * <p>Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is
     * <em>NOT</em> a constant-time operation. Because of the
     * asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current
     * number of elements requires an O(n) traversal.
     * Additionally, if elements are added or removed during execution
     * of this method, the returned result may be inaccurate.  Thus,
     * this method is typically not very useful in concurrent
     * applications.
