     * Returns a short label which explains the reason for the disconnect cause and is for display
     * in the user interface. If not null, it is expected that the In-Call UI should display this
     * text where it would normally display the call state ("Dialing", "Disconnected") and is
     * therefore expected to be relatively small. The {@link ConnectionService } is responsible for
     * providing and localizing this label. If there is no string provided, returns null.

     * @return The disconnect label.
