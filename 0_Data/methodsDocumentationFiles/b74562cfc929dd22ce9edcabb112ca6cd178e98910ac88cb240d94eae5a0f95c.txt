     * Enqueue a message at the front of the message queue, to be processed on
     * the next iteration of the message loop.  You will receive it in
     * {@link #handleMessage}, in the thread attached to this handler.
     * <b>This method is only for use in very special circumstances -- it
     * can easily starve the message queue, cause ordering problems, or have
     * other unexpected side-effects.</b>
     *  
     * @return Returns true if the message was successfully placed in to the 
     *         message queue.  Returns false on failure, usually because the
     *         looper processing the message queue is exiting.
