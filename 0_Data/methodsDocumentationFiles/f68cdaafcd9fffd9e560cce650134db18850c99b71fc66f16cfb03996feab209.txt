     * Manually render this view (and all of its children) to the given Canvas.
     * The view must have already done a full layout before this function is
     * called.  When implementing a view, implement
     * {@link #onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)} instead of overriding this method.
     * If you do need to override this method, call the superclass version.
     *
     * @param canvas The Canvas to which the View is rendered.
