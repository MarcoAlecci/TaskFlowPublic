     * Checks whether a particular permissions has been revoked for a
     * package by policy. Typically the device owner or the profile owner
     * may apply such a policy. The user cannot grant policy revoked
     * permissions, hence the only way for an app to get such a permission
     * is by a policy change.
     *
     * @param permName The name of the permission you are checking for.
     * @param packageName The name of the package you are checking against.
     *
     * @return Whether the permission is restricted by policy.
