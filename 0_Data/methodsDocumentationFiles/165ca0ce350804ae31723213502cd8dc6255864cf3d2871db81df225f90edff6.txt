     * If the rectangle specified by left,top,right,bottom intersects this
     * rectangle, return true and set this rectangle to that intersection,
     * otherwise return false and do not change this rectangle. No check is
     * performed to see if either rectangle is empty. Note: To just test for
     * intersection, use intersects()
     *
     * @param left The left side of the rectangle being intersected with this
     *             rectangle
     * @param top The top of the rectangle being intersected with this rectangle
     * @param right The right side of the rectangle being intersected with this
     *              rectangle.
     * @param bottom The bottom of the rectangle being intersected with this
     *             rectangle.
     * @return true if the specified rectangle and this rectangle intersect
     *              (and this rectangle is then set to that intersection) else
     *              return false and do not change this rectangle.
