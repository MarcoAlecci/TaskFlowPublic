     * Creates instance of the class to to derive keys using salted SHA256 hash.
     *
     * <p>The salted SHA256 hash is computed over the concatenation of four byte strings, salt_len +
     * salt + key_material_len + key_material, where salt_len and key_material_len are 4-byte, and
     * denote the number of bytes for salt and key_material, respectively.
