     * Returns an array of Addresses that are known to describe the
     * named location, which may be a place name such as "Dalvik,
     * Iceland", an address such as "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
     * Mountain View, CA", an airport code such as "SFO", etc..  The
     * returned addresses will be localized for the locale provided to
     * this class's constructor.
     *
     * <p> You may specify a bounding box for the search results by including
     * the Latitude and Longitude of the Lower Left point and Upper Right
     * point of the box.
     *
     * <p> The query will block and returned values will be obtained by means of a network lookup.
     * The results are a best guess and are not guaranteed to be meaningful or
     * correct. It may be useful to call this method from a thread separate from your
     * primary UI thread.
     *
     * @param locationName a user-supplied description of a location
     * @param maxResults max number of addresses to return. Smaller numbers (1 to 5) are recommended

     * @param lowerLeftLongitude the longitude of the lower left corner of the bounding box
     * @param upperRightLatitude the latitude of the upper right corner of the bounding box
     * @param upperRightLongitude the longitude of the upper right corner of the bounding box

     * @return a list of Address objects. Returns null or empty list if no matches were
     * found or there is no backend service available.
