     * Compares this {@code BigDecimal} with {@code val}. Returns one of the
     * three values {@code 1}, {@code 0}, or {@code -1}. The method behaves as
     * if {@code this.subtract(val)} is computed. If this difference is > 0 then
     * 1 is returned, if the difference is < 0 then -1 is returned, and if the
     * difference is 0 then 0 is returned. This means, that if two decimal
     * instances are compared which are equal in value but differ in scale, then
     * these two instances are considered as equal.
     *
     * @param val
     *            value to be compared with {@code this}.
     * @return {@code 1} if {@code this > val}, {@code -1} if {@code this < val},
     *         {@code 0} if {@code this == val}.
     * @throws NullPointerException
     *             if {@code val == null}.
