         * Returns which fields in the selected datasets were changed by the user after the dataset
         * was selected.
         *
         * <p>For example, server provides:
         *
         * <pre class="prettyprint">
         *  FillResponse response = new FillResponse.Builder()
         *      .addDataset(new Dataset.Builder(presentation1)
         *          .setId("4815")
         *          .setValue(usernameId, AutofillValue.forText("MrPlow"))
         *          .build())
         *      .addDataset(new Dataset.Builder(presentation2)
         *          .setId("162342")
         *          .setValue(passwordId, AutofillValue.forText("D'OH"))
         *          .build())
         *      .build();
         * </pre>
         *
         * <p>User select both datasets (for username and password) but after the fields are
         * autofilled, user changes them to:
         *
         * <pre class="prettyprint">
         *   username = "ElBarto";
         *   password = "AyCaramba";
         * </pre>
         *
         * <p>Then the result is the following map:
         *
         * <pre class="prettyprint">
         *   usernameId => "4815"
         *   passwordId => "162342"
         * </pre>
         *
         * <p><b>Note: </b>Only set on events of type {@link #TYPE_CONTEXT_COMMITTED}.
         *
         * @return map map whose key is the id of the change fields, and value is the id of
         * dataset that has that field and was selected by the user.
