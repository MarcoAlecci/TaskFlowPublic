     * Called by a device admin to set the password expiration timeout. Calling this method will
     * restart the countdown for password expiration for the given admin, as will changing the
     * device password (for all admins).
     * <p>
     * The provided timeout is the time delta in ms and will be added to the current time. For
     * example, to have the password expire 5 days from now, timeout would be 5 * 86400 * 1000 =
     * 432000000 ms for timeout.
     * <p>
     * To disable password expiration, a value of 0 may be used for timeout.
     * <p>
     * On devices not supporting {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_SECURE_LOCK_SCREEN} feature, the
     * password expiration is always disabled.
     * <p>
     * The calling device admin must have requested
     * {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_EXPIRE_PASSWORD} to be able to call this method; if it has
     * not, a security exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * Note that setting the password will automatically reset the expiration time for all active
     * admins. Active admins do not need to explicitly call this method in that case.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to set restrictions on the parent
     * profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param timeout The limit (in ms) that a password can remain in effect. A value of 0 means
     *            there is no restriction (unlimited).
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not an active administrator or {@code admin}
     *             does not use {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_EXPIRE_PASSWORD}
