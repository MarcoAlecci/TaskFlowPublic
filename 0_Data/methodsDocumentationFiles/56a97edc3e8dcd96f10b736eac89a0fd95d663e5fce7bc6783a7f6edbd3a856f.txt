     * Inform the notification manager about dismissal of a single notification.
     * <p>
     * Use this if your listener has a user interface that allows the user to dismiss individual
     * notifications, similar to the behavior of Android's status bar and notification panel.
     * It should be called after the user dismisses a single notification using your UI;
     * upon being informed, the notification manager will actually remove the notification
     * and you will get an {@link #onNotificationRemoved(StatusBarNotification)} callback.
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> If your listener allows the user to fire a notification's
     * {@link android.app.Notification#contentIntent} by tapping/clicking/etc., you should call
     * this method at that time <i>if</i> the Notification in question has the
     * {@link android.app.Notification#FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL} flag set.
     * <p>
     *
     * <p>The service should wait for the {@link #onListenerConnected()} event
     * before performing this operation.
     *
     * @param key Notification to dismiss from {@link StatusBarNotification#getKey()}.
