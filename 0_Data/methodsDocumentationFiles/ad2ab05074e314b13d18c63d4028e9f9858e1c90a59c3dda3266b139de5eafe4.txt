     * Scale the region by the given scale amount. This re-constructs new region by
     * scaling the rects that this region consists of. New rectis are computed by scaling 
     * coordinates by float, then rounded by roundf() function to integers. This may results
     * in less internal rects if 0 < scale < 1. Zero and Negative scale result in
     * an empty region. If this region is empty, do nothing.
