         * The simplest way of creating a {@link android.app.WallpaperColors} object is by using
         * {@link android.app.WallpaperColors#fromBitmap(Bitmap)} or
         * {@link android.app.WallpaperColors#fromDrawable(Drawable)}, but you can also specify
         * your main colors by constructing a {@link android.app.WallpaperColors} object manually.
         *
         * @return Wallpaper colors.
