         * This method is called when an image capture has fully completed and all the
         * result metadata is available.
         *
         * <p>This callback will always fire after the last {@link #onCaptureProgressed};
         * in other words, no more partial results will be delivered once the completed result
         * is available.</p>
         *
         * <p>For performance-intensive use-cases where latency is a factor, consider
         * using {@link #onCaptureProgressed} instead.</p>
         *
         * <p>The default implementation of this method does nothing.</p>
         *
         * @param session the session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}

         * @param result The total output metadata from the capture, including the
         * final capture parameters and the state of the camera system during
         * capture.
