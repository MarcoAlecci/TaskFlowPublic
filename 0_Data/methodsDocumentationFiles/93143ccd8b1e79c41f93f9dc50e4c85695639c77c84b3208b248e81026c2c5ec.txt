     * Set an explicit MIME data type.
     *
     * <p>This is used to create intents that only specify a type and not data,
     * for example to indicate the type of data to return.
     *
     * <p>This method automatically clears any data that was
     * previously set (for example by {@link #setData}).
     *
     * <p><em>Note: MIME type matching in the Android framework is
     * case-sensitive, unlike formal RFC MIME types.  As a result,
     * you should always write your MIME types with lower case letters,
     * or use {@link #normalizeMimeType} or {@link #setTypeAndNormalize}
     * to ensure that it is converted to lower case.</em>
     *
     * @param type The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.
     *
     * @return Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls
     * into a single statement.
