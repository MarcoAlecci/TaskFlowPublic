     * Adds a pre-allocated buffer to the raw image callback buffer queue.
     * Applications can add one or more buffers to the queue. When a raw image
     * frame arrives and there is still at least one available buffer, the
     * buffer will be used to hold the raw image data and removed from the
     * queue. Then raw image callback is invoked with the buffer. If a raw
     * image frame arrives but there is no buffer left, the frame is
     * discarded. Applications should add buffers back when they finish
     * processing the data in them by calling this method again in order
     * to avoid running out of raw image callback buffers.
     *
     * <p>The size of the buffer is determined by multiplying the raw image
     * width, height, and bytes per pixel. The width and height can be
     * read from {@link Camera.Parameters#getPictureSize()}. Bytes per pixel
     * can be computed from
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#getBitsPerPixel(int)} / 8,
     * using the image format from {@link Camera.Parameters#getPreviewFormat()}.
     *
     * <p>This method is only necessary when the PictureCallbck for raw image
     * is used while calling {@link #takePicture(Camera.ShutterCallback,
     * Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback)}.
     *
     * <p>Please note that by calling this method, the mode for
     * application-managed callback buffers is triggered. If this method has
     * never been called, null will be returned by the raw image callback since
     * there is no image callback buffer available. Furthermore, When a supplied
     * buffer is too small to hold the raw image data, raw image callback will
     * return null and the buffer will be removed from the buffer queue.
     *
     * @param callbackBuffer the buffer to add to the raw image callback buffer
     *     queue. The size should be width * height * (bits per pixel) / 8. An
     *     null callbackBuffer will be ignored and won't be added to the queue.
     *
     * @see #takePicture(Camera.ShutterCallback,
     * Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback)}.
