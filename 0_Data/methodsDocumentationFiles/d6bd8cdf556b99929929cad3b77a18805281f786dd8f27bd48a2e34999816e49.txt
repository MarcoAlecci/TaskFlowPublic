     * Sets the activation edge size relative to the host view's dimensions.

     * If both relative and maximum edges are specified, the maximum edge will
     * be used to constrain the calculated relative edge size.
     *
     * @param horizontal The horizontal edge size as a fraction of the host view
     *            width, or {@link #RELATIVE_UNSPECIFIED} to always use the
     *            maximum value.
     * @param vertical The vertical edge size as a fraction of the host view
     *            height, or {@link #RELATIVE_UNSPECIFIED} to always use the
     *            maximum value.
     * @return The scroll helper, which may used to chain setter calls.
