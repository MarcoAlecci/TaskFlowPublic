     * Returns whether the RenderNode has a display list. If this returns false, the RenderNode
     * should be re-recorded with {@link #beginRecording()} and {@link #endRecording()}.
     *
     * A RenderNode without a display list may still be drawn, however it will have no impact
     * on the rendering content until its display list is updated.
     *
     * When a RenderNode is no longer drawn by anything the system may automatically
     * invoke {@link #discardDisplayList()}. It is therefore important to ensure that
     * {@link #hasDisplayList()} is true on a RenderNode prior to drawing it.
     *
     * See {@link #discardDisplayList()}
     *
     * @return boolean true if this RenderNode has a display list, false otherwise.
