     * Returns a stream of indices for which this {@code BitSet}
     * contains a bit in the set state. The indices are returned
     * in order, from lowest to highest. The size of the stream
     * is the number of bits in the set state, equal to the value
     * returned by the {@link #cardinality()} method.
     *
     * <p>The bit set must remain constant during the execution of the
     * terminal stream operation.  Otherwise, the result of the terminal
     * stream operation is undefined.
