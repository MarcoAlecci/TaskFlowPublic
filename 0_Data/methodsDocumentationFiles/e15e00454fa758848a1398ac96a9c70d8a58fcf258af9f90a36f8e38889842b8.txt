     * Retrieve overall information about an application package that is
     * installed on the system. This method can be used for retrieving
     * information about packages for which multiple versions can be installed
     * at the time. Currently only packages hosting static shared libraries can
     * have multiple installed versions. The method can also be used to get info
     * for a package that has a single version installed by passing
     * {@link #VERSION_CODE_HIGHEST} in the {@link VersionedPackage}
     * constructor.
     *
     * @param versionedPackage The versioned package for which to query.
     * @param flags Additional option flags to modify the data returned.
     * @return A PackageInfo object containing information about the package. If
     *         flag {@code MATCH_UNINSTALLED_PACKAGES} is set and if the package
     *         is not found in the list of installed applications, the package
     *         information is retrieved from the list of uninstalled
     *         applications (which includes installed applications as well as
     *         applications with data directory i.e. applications which had been
     *         deleted with {@code DELETE_KEEP_DATA} flag set).
     * @throws NameNotFoundException if a package with the given name cannot be
     *             found on the system.
