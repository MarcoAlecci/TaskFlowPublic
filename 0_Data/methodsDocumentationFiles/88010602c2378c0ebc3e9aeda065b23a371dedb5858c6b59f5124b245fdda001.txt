     * Return the max width for icons, in pixels.
     *
     * <p> Note that this method returns max width of icon's visible part. Hence, it does not take
     * into account the inset introduced by {@link AdaptiveIconDrawable}. To calculate bitmap image
     * to function as {@link AdaptiveIconDrawable}, multiply
     * 1 + 2 * {@link AdaptiveIconDrawable#getExtraInsetFraction()} to the returned size.
