     * Returns the interpolated fractional progress of this animation between
     * start state of the animation and the end state of the animation. Note
     * that this progress is the global progress of the animation, whereas
     * {@link Callback#onProgress} will only dispatch the insets that may
     * be inset with {@link WindowInsets#inset} by parents of views in the hierarchy.
     * Progress per insets animation is global for the entire animation. One animation animates
     * all things together (in, out, ...). If they don't animate together, we'd have
     * multiple animations.
     * <p>
     * Note: In case the application is controlling the animation, the valued returned here will
     * be the same as the application passed into
     * {@link WindowInsetsAnimationController#setInsetsAndAlpha(Insets, float, float)},
     * interpolated with the interpolator passed into
     * {@link WindowInsetsController#controlWindowInsetsAnimation}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note: For system-initiated animations, this will always return a valid value between 0
     * and 1.
     * </p>
     * @see #getFraction() for raw fraction.
     * @return The current interpolated progress of this animation.
