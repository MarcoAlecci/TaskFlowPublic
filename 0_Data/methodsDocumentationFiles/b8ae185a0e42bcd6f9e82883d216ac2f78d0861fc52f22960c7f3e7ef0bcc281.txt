     * If rectangles a and b intersect, return true and set this rectangle to
     * that intersection, otherwise return false and do not change this
     * rectangle. No check is performed to see if either rectangle is empty.
     * To just test for intersection, use intersects()
     *
     * @param a The first rectangle being intersected with
     * @param b The second rectangle being intersected with
     * @return true iff the two specified rectangles intersect. If they do, set
     *              this rectangle to that intersection. If they do not, return
     *              false and do not change this rectangle.
