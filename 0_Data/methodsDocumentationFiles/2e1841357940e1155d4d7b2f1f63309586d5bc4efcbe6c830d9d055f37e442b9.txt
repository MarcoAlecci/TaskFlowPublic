     * Converts drawing order position to container position.

     * Children are not necessarily drawn in the order in which they appear in the container.
     * ViewGroups can enable a custom ordering via {@link #setChildrenDrawingOrderEnabled(boolean)}.
     * This method returns the container position of a child that appears in the given position
     * in the current drawing order.
     *
     * @param drawingPosition the drawing order position.
     * @return the container position of a child for this drawing order position.
