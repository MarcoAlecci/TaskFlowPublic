     * <p class="note">The data you retrieve here <strong>must not</strong>
     * be placed in any kind of persistent storage (on local disk, across
     * a network, etc).  For that, you should use standard serialization
     * or another kind of general serialization mechanism.  The Parcel
     * marshalled representation is highly optimized for local IPC, and as
     * such does not attempt to maintain compatibility with data created
     * in different versions of the platform.
