     * Checks whether the calling package is allowed to request package installs through package
     * installer. Apps are encouraged to call this API before launching the package installer via
     * intent {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE}. Starting from Android O, the
     * user can explicitly choose what external sources they trust to install apps on the device.
     * If this API returns false, the install request will be blocked by the package installer and
     * a dialog will be shown to the user with an option to launch settings to change their
     * preference. An application must target Android O or higher and declare permission
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES} in order to use this API.
     *
     * @return true if the calling package is trusted by the user to request install packages on
     * the device, false otherwise.
