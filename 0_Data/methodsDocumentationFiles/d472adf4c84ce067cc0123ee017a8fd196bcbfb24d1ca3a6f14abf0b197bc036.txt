     * Creates a print job for printing a {@link PrintDocumentAdapter} with
     * default print attributes.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method brings the print UI allowing the user to customize
     * the print job and returns a {@link PrintJob} object without waiting for the
     * user to customize or confirm the print job. The returned print job instance
     * is in a {@link PrintJobInfo#STATE_CREATED created} state.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called only from an {@link Activity}. The rationale is that
     * printing from a service will create an inconsistent user experience as the print
     * UI would appear without any context.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Also the passed in {@link PrintDocumentAdapter} will be considered invalid if
     * your activity is finished. The rationale is that once the activity that
     * initiated printing is finished, the provided adapter may be in an inconsistent
     * state as it may depend on the UI presented by the activity.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The default print attributes are a hint to the system how the data is to
     * be printed. For example, a photo editor may look at the photo aspect ratio
     * to determine the default orientation and provide a hint whether the printing
     * should be in portrait or landscape. The system will do a best effort to
     * selected the hinted options in the print dialog, given the current printer
     * supports them.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> Calling this method will bring the print dialog and
     * the system will connect to the provided {@link PrintDocumentAdapter}. If a
     * configuration change occurs that you application does not handle, for example
     * a rotation change, the system will drop the connection to the adapter as the
     * activity has to be recreated and the old adapter may be invalid in this context,
     * hence a new adapter instance is required. As a consequence, if your activity
     * does not handle configuration changes (default behavior), you have to save the
     * state that you were printing and call this method again when your activity
     * is recreated.
     * </p>
