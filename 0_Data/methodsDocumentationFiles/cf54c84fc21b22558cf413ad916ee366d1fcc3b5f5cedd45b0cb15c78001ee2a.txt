     * Returns the index of the nearest bit that is set to {@code true}
     * that occurs on or before the specified starting index.
     * If no such bit exists, or if {@code -1} is given as the
     * starting index, then {@code -1} is returned.
     *
     * <p>To iterate over the {@code true} bits in a {@code BitSet},
     * use the following loop:
     *
     *  <pre> {@code
     * for (int i = bs.length(); (i = bs.previousSetBit(i-1)) >= 0; ) {
     *     // operate on index i here
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @param  fromIndex the index to start checking from (inclusive)
     * @return the index of the previous set bit, or {@code -1} if there
     *         is no such bit
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the specified index is less
     *         than {@code -1}
