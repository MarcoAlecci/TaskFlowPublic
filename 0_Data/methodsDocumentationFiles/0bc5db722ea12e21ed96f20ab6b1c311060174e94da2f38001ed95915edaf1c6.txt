     * Set a web URI associated with the current data being shown to the user.
     * This URI could be opened in a web browser, or in the app as an
     * {@link Intent#ACTION_VIEW} Intent, to show the same data that is currently
     * being displayed by it.  The URI here should be something that is transportable
     * off the device into other environments to acesss the same data as is currently
     * being shown in the app; if the app does not have such a representation, it should
     * leave the null and only report the local intent and clip data.
