     * Convenience method to return an Enumeration with all or a
     * subset of the InetAddresses bound to this network interface.
     * <p>
     * If there is a security manager, its {@code checkConnect}
     * method is called for each InetAddress. Only InetAddresses where
     * the {@code checkConnect} doesn't throw a SecurityException
     * will be returned in the Enumeration. However, if the caller has the
     * {@link NetPermission}("getNetworkInformation") permission, then all
     * InetAddresses are returned.
     * @return an Enumeration object with all or a subset of the InetAddresses
     * bound to this network interface
