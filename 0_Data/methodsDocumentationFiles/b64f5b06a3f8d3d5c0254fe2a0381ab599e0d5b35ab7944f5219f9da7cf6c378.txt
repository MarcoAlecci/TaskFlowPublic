     * Make a deep copy of the given bundle.  Traverses into inner containers and copies
     * them as well, so they are not shared across bundles.  Will traverse in to
     * {@link Bundle}, {@link PersistableBundle}, {@link ArrayList}, and all types of
     * primitive arrays.  Other types of objects (such as Parcelable or Serializable)
     * are referenced as-is and not copied in any way.
