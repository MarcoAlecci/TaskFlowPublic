     * To record a picture, call beginRecording() and then draw into the Canvas
     * that is returned. Nothing we appear on screen, but all of the draw
     * commands (e.g. {@link Canvas#drawRect(Rect, Paint)}) will be recorded.
     * To stop recording, call endRecording(). After endRecording() the Canvas
     * that was returned must no longer be used, and nothing should be drawn
     * into it.
