     * Set this path to the result of applying the Op to the two specified paths.
     * The resulting path will be constructed from non-overlapping contours.
     * The curve order is reduced where possible so that cubics may be turned
     * into quadratics, and quadratics maybe turned into lines.
     *
     * @param path1 The first operand (for difference, the minuend)
     * @param path2 The second operand (for difference, the subtrahend)

     * @return True if operation succeeded, false otherwise and this path remains unmodified.
