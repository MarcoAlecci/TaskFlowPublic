     * {@link SmsManager} instance has been created with {@link #getDefault()}, and no user-defined
     * default subscription is defined, the subscription ID associated with this message will be
     * INVALID, which will result in the SMS being sent on the subscription associated with logical
     * slot 0. Use {@link #getSmsManagerForSubscriptionId(int)} to ensure the SMS is sent on the
     * correct subscription.
