     * Return storage statistics for a specific package on the requested storage
     * volume.
     * <p class="note">
     * Note: no permissions are required when calling this API for your own
     * package. However, requesting details for any other package requires the
     * {@code android.Manifest.permission#PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS} permission, which
     * is a system-level permission that will not be granted to normal apps.
     * Declaring that permission expresses your intention to use this API and an
     * end user can then choose to grant this permission through the Settings
     * application.
     * </p>
     * <p class="note">
     * Note: if the requested package uses the {@code android:sharedUserId}
     * manifest feature, this call will be forced into a slower manual
     * calculation path. If possible, consider always using
     * {@link #queryStatsForUid(UUID, int)}, which is typically faster.
