     * Return whether a shortcut is static; that is, whether a shortcut is
     * published from AndroidManifest.xml.  If {@code true}, the shortcut is
     * also {@link #isImmutable()}.
     *
     * <p>When an app is upgraded and a shortcut is no longer published from AndroidManifest.xml,
     * this will be set to {@code false}.  If the shortcut is not pinned, then it'll disappear.
     * However, if it's pinned, it will still be visible, {@link #isEnabled()} will be
     * {@code false} and {@link #isImmutable()} will be {@code true}.
