     * Returns a cached instance if such is available or a new one is
     * created. The returned instance is initialized from the given
     * <code>event</code>.
     *
     * <p>In most situations object pooling is not beneficial. Create a new instance using the
     * constructor {@link #AccessibilityEvent(AccessibilityEvent)} instead.
     *
     * @param event The other event.
     * @return An instance.
