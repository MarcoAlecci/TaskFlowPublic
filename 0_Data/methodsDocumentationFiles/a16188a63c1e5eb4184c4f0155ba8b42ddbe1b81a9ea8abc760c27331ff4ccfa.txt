     * Returns connection status information about a particular
     * network type.
     *
     * @param networkType integer specifying which networkType in
     *        which you're interested.
     * @return a {@link NetworkInfo} object for the requested
     *        network type or {@code null} if the type is not
     *        supported by the device. If {@code networkType} is
     *        TYPE_VPN and a VPN is active for the calling app,
     *        then this method will try to return one of the
     *        underlying networks for the VPN or null if the
     *        VPN agent didn't specify any.
     *
     * @deprecated This method does not support multiple connected networks
     *             of the same type. Use {@link #getAllNetworks} and
     *             {@link #getNetworkInfo(android.net.Network)} instead.
