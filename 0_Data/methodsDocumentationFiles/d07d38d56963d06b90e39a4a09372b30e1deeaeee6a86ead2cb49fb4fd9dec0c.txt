     * Query whether the vibrator supports the given effects.
     *
     * Not all hardware reports its effect capabilities, so the system may not necessarily know
     * whether an effect is supported or not.
     *
     * The returned array will be the same length as the query array and the value at a given index
     * will contain {@link #VIBRATION_EFFECT_SUPPORT_YES} if the effect at that same index in the
     * querying array is supported, {@link #VIBRATION_EFFECT_SUPPORT_NO} if it isn't supported, or
     * {@link #VIBRATION_EFFECT_SUPPORT_UNKNOWN} if the system can't determine whether it's
     * supported or not.
     *
     * @param effectIds Which effects to query for.
     * @return An array containing the systems current knowledge about whether the given effects
     * are supported or not.
