     * Default implementation of {@link KeyEvent.Callback#onKeyLongPress(int, KeyEvent)
     * KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyLongPress()}: always returns false (doesn't handle
     * the event).
     *
     * To receive this callback, you must return true from onKeyDown for the current
     * event stream.
