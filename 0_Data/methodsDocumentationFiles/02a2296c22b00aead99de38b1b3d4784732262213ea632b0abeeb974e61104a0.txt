     * Start hardware-batching of GNSS locations. This API is primarily used when the AP is
     * asleep and the device can batch GNSS locations in the hardware.
     *
     * Note this is designed (as was the fused location interface before it) for a single user
     * SystemApi - requests are not consolidated.  Care should be taken when the System switches
     * users that may have different batching requests, to stop hardware batching for one user, and
     * restart it for the next.
     *
     * @param periodNanos Time interval, in nanoseconds, that the GNSS locations are requested
     *                    within the batch
     * @param wakeOnFifoFull True if the hardware batching should flush the locations in a
     *                       a callback to the listener, when it's internal buffer is full.  If
     *                       set to false, the oldest location information is, instead,
     *                       dropped when the buffer is full.
     * @param callback The listener on which to return the batched locations
     * @param handler The handler on which to process the callback
