     * Set the id of the physical camera for this OutputConfiguration
     *
     * <p>In the case one logical camera is made up of multiple physical cameras, it could be
     * desirable for the camera application to request streams from individual physical cameras.
     * This call achieves it by mapping the OutputConfiguration to the physical camera id.</p>
     *
     * <p>The valid physical camera ids can be queried by {@link
     * android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#getPhysicalCameraIds}.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>Passing in a null physicalCameraId means that the OutputConfiguration is for a logical
     * stream.</p>
     *
     * <p>This function must be called before {@link
     * CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations} or {@link
     * CameraDevice#createReprocessableCaptureSessionByConfigurations}. Calling this function
     * after {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations} or {@link
     * CameraDevice#createReprocessableCaptureSessionByConfigurations} has no effect.</p>
     *
     * <p>The surface belonging to a physical camera OutputConfiguration must not be used as input
     * or output of a reprocessing request. </p>
