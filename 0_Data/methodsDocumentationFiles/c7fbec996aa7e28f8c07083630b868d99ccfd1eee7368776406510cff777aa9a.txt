     * Adds a {@link Drawable} to the overlay. The bounds of the drawable should be relative to
     * the host view. Any drawable added to the overlay should be removed when it is no longer
     * needed or no longer visible. Adding an already existing {@link Drawable}
     * is a no-op. Passing <code>null</code> parameter will result in an
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException} being thrown.

     * @param drawable The {@link Drawable} to be added to the overlay. This drawable will be
     * drawn when the view redraws its overlay. {@link Drawable}s will be drawn in the order that
     * they were added.
