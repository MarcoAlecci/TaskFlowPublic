     * Compares this Uri to another object for equality. Returns true if the
     * encoded string representations of this Uri and the given Uri are
     * equal. Case counts. Paths are not normalized. If one Uri specifies a
     * default port explicitly and the other leaves it implicit, they will not
     * be considered equal.
