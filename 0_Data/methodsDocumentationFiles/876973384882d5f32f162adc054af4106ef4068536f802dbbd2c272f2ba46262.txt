     * @deprecated Applications shouldn't request a restore operation using this method. In Android
     * P and later, this method is a no-op.
     *
     * <p>Restore the calling application from backup. The data will be restored from the
     * current backup dataset if the application has stored data there, or from
     * the dataset used during the last full device setup operation if the current
     * backup dataset has no matching data.  If no backup data exists for this application
     * in either source, a non-zero value is returned.
     *
     * <p>If this method returns zero (meaning success), the OS attempts to retrieve a backed-up
     * dataset from the remote transport, instantiate the application's backup agent, and pass the
     * dataset to the agent's
     * {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent#onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()}
     * method.
     *
     * <p class="caution">Unlike other restore operations, this method doesn't terminate the
     * application after the restore. The application continues running to receive the
     * {@link RestoreObserver} callbacks on the {@code observer} argument. Full backups use an
     * {@link android.app.Application Application} base class while key-value backups use the
     * application subclass declared in the AndroidManifest.xml {@code <application>} tag.
     *
     * @param observer The {@link RestoreObserver} to receive callbacks during the restore
     * operation. This must not be null.
     *
     * @return Zero on success; nonzero on error.
