     * Remove html, remove bad characters, and truncate string.
     *
     * <p>This method is meant to remove common mistakes and nefarious formatting from strings that
     * were loaded from untrusted sources (such as other packages).
     *
     * <p>This method first {@link Html#fromHtml treats the string like HTML} and then ...
     * <ul>
     * <li>Removes new lines or truncates at first new line
     * <li>Trims the white-space off the end
     * <li>Truncates the string
     * </ul>
     * ... if specified.

     * @param unclean The input string
     * @param maxCharactersToConsider The maximum number of characters of {@code unclean} to
     *                                consider from the input string. {@code 0} disables this
     *                                feature.
     * @param ellipsizeDip Assuming maximum length of the string (in dip), assuming font size 42.
     *                     This is roughly 50 characters for {@code ellipsizeDip == 1000}.<br />
     *                     Usually ellipsizing should be left to the view showing the string. If a
     *                     string is used as an input to another string, it might be useful to
     *                     control the length of the input string though. {@code 0} disables this
     *                     feature.
     * @param flags Flags controlling cleaning behavior (Can be {@link #SAFE_STRING_FLAG_TRIM},
     *              {@link #SAFE_STRING_FLAG_SINGLE_LINE},
     *              and {@link #SAFE_STRING_FLAG_FIRST_LINE})

     * @return The cleaned string
