     * has one and if it can be accessed given the current privileges.
     * If a security manager is set, then the caller must have
     * the permission {@link NetPermission}("getNetworkInformation").
     *
     * @return  a byte array containing the address, or {@code null} if
     *          the address doesn't exist, is not accessible or a security
     *          manager is set and the caller does not have the permission
     *          NetPermission("getNetworkInformation"). For example, this
     *          method will generally return {@code null} when called by
     *          non-system apps having
     *          {@code targetSdkVersion >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.R}.
