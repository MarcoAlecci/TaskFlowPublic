     * Called by an application that is administering the device to
     * determine the current encryption status of the device.
     * <p>
     * Depending on the returned status code, the caller may proceed in different
     * ways.  If the result is {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED}, the
     * storage system does not support encryption.  If the
     * result is {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_INACTIVE}, use {@link
     * #ACTION_START_ENCRYPTION} to begin the process of encrypting or decrypting the
     * storage.  If the result is {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVE_DEFAULT_KEY}, the
     * storage system has enabled encryption but no password is set so further action
     * may be required.  If the result is {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVATING},
     * {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVE} or {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVE_PER_USER},
     * no further action is required.
     *
     * @return current status of encryption. The value will be one of
     * {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED}, {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_INACTIVE},
     * {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVATING}, {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVE_DEFAULT_KEY},
     * {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVE}, or {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVE_PER_USER}.
