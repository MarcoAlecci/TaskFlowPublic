         * Sets the intended frame rate for the surface {@link SurfaceControl}.
         * <p>
         * On devices that are capable of running the display at different refresh rates, the system
         * may choose a display refresh rate to better match this surface's frame rate. Usage of
         * this API won't directly affect the application's frame production pipeline. However,
         * because the system may change the display refresh rate, calls to this function may result
         * in changes to Choreographer callback timings, and changes to the time interval at which
         * the system releases buffers back to the application.
         *
         * @param sc The SurfaceControl to specify the frame rate of.
         * @param frameRate The intended frame rate for this surface, in frames per second. 0 is a
         *                  special value that indicates the app will accept the system's choice for
         *                  the display frame rate, which is the default behavior if this function
         *                  isn't called. The frameRate param does <em>not</em> need to be a valid
         *                  refresh rate for this device's display - e.g., it's fine to pass 30fps
         *                  to a device that can only run the display at 60fps.
         * @param compatibility The frame rate compatibility of this surface. The compatibility
         *                      value may influence the system's choice of display frame rate. See
         *                      the Surface.FRAME_RATE_COMPATIBILITY_* values for more info.
         * @return This transaction object.
