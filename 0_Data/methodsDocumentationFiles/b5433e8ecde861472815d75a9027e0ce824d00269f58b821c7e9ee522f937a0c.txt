     * Override this to control when the soft input area should be shown to the user.  The default
     * implementation returns {@code false} when there is no hard keyboard or the keyboard is hidden
     * unless the user shows an intention to use software keyboard.  If you change what this
     * returns, you will need to call {@link #updateInputViewShown()} yourself whenever the returned
     * value may have changed to have it re-evaluated and applied.
     *
     * <p>When you override this method, it is recommended to call
     * {@code super.onEvaluateInputViewShown()} and return {@code true} when {@code true} is
     * returned.</p>
