         * Normally an authentication-bound key is tied to the secure user id of the current user
         * (either the root SID from GateKeeper for auth-bound keys with a timeout, or the
         * authenticator id of the current biometric set for keys requiring explicit biometric
         * authorization). If this parameter is set (this method returning non-zero value), the key
         * should be tied to the specified secure user id, overriding the logic above.
         *
         * This is only applicable when {@link #setUserAuthenticationRequired} is set to
         * {@code true}
