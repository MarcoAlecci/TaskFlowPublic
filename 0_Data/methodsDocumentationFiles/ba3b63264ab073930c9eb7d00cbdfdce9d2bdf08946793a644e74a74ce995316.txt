     * Sets a list of areas within this view's post-layout coordinate space where the system
     * should not intercept touch or other pointing device gestures. <em>This method should
     * be called by {@link #onLayout(boolean, int, int, int, int)} or {@link #onDraw(Canvas)}.</em>
     *
     * <p>Use this to tell the system which specific sub-areas of a view need to receive gesture
     * input in order to function correctly in the presence of global system gestures that may
     * conflict. For example, if the system wishes to capture swipe-in-from-screen-edge gestures
     * to provide system-level navigation functionality, a view such as a navigation drawer
     * container can mark the left (or starting) edge of itself as requiring gesture capture
     * priority using this API. The system may then choose to relax its own gesture recognition
     * to allow the app to consume the user's gesture. It is not necessary for an app to register
     * exclusion rects for broadly spanning regions such as the entirety of a
     * <code>ScrollView</code> or for simple press and release click targets such as
     * <code>Button</code>. Mark an exclusion rect when interacting with a view requires
     * a precision touch gesture in a small area in either the X or Y dimension, such as
     * an edge swipe or dragging a <code>SeekBar</code> thumb.</p>
     *
     * <p>Do not modify the provided list after this method is called.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note: the system will put a limit of <code>200dp</code> on the vertical extent of the
     * exclusions it takes into account. The limit does not apply while the navigation
     * bar is {@link #SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY stickily} hidden, nor to the
     * {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService input method} and
     * {@link Intent#CATEGORY_HOME home activity}.
