     * <p>Returns the half-precision float value corresponding to a given
     * bit representation.</p>
     *
     * <p>The argument is considered to be a representation of a half-precision
     * float value according to the bit layout described in {@link Half}. The 16
     * most significant bits of the argument are ignored.</p>
     *
     * @param bits An integer
     * @return The half-precision float value with the same bit pattern
