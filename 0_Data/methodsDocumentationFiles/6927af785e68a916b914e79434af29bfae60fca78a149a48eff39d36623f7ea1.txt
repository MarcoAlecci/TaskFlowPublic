     * Return a TimerStat object for the given key.
     *
     * This will allocate a new {@link TimerStat} object, which may be wasteful. Instead, use
     * {@link #getTimerCount} and {@link #getTimerTime}.
     *
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException When the key is not present in this object.
     * @see #hasTimer hasTimer(int) To check if a value for the given key is present.
