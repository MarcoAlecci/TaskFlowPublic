     * After successfully configuring the component, call {@code start}.
     * <p>
     * Call {@code start} also if the codec is configured in asynchronous mode,
     * and it has just been flushed, to resume requesting input buffers.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if not in the Configured state
     *         or just after {@link #flush} for a codec that is configured
     *         in asynchronous mode.
     * @throws MediaCodec.CodecException upon codec error. Note that some codec errors
     * for start may be attributed to future method calls.
