     * Describes how the child views are positioned. Defaults to
     * <code>Gravity.START | Gravity.TOP</code>.
     *
     * <p>Note that since RelativeLayout considers the positioning of each child
     * relative to one another to be significant, setting gravity will affect
     * the positioning of all children as a single unit within the parent.
     * This happens after children have been relatively positioned.</p>
