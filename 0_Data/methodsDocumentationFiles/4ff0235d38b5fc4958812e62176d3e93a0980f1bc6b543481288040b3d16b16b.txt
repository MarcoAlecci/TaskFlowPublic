     * Pins distance to 0 <= distance <= getLength(), and then computes the
     * corresponding matrix. Returns false if there is no path, or a zero-length
     * path was specified, in which case matrix is unchanged.
     *
     * @param distance The distance along the associated path
     * @param matrix Allocated by the caller, this is set to the transformation
     *        associated with the position and tangent at the specified distance
     * @param flags Specified what aspects should be returned in the matrix.
