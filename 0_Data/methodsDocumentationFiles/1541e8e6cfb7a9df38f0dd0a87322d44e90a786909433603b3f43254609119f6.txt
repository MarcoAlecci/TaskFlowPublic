     * Initialize partitions for a payload associated with the given payload
     * metadata {@code payloadMetadataFilename} by preallocating required space.
     *
     * <p>This function should be called after payload has been verified after
     * {@link #verifyPayloadMetadata}. This function does not verify whether
     * the given payload is applicable or not.
     *
     * <p>Implementation of {@code allocateSpace} uses
     * {@code headerKeyValuePairs} to determine whether space has been allocated
     * for a different or same payload previously. If space has been allocated
     * for a different payload before, space will be reallocated for the given
     * payload. If space has been allocated for the same payload, no actions to
     * storage devices are taken.
     *
     * <p>This function is synchronous and may take a non-trivial amount of
     * time. Callers should call this function in a background thread.
