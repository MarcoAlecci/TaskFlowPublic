     * This function is called when an instance or subclass sets the state description. Once this
     * is called and the argument is not null, the app developer will be responsible for updating
     * state description when progress changes and the default state description will not be used.
     * App developers can restore the default behavior by setting the argument to null. If set
     * progress is called first and then setStateDescription is called, two state change events
     * will be merged by event throttling and we can still get the correct state description.
     *
     * @param stateDescription The state description.
