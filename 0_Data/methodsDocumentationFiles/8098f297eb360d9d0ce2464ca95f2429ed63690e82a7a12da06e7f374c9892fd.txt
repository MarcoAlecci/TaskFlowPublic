     * Returns the Audio Description mix level in dB.
     *
     * If Audio Description mixing is unavailable from the hardware device,
     * a value of {@code Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY} is returned.
     *
     * @return the current Audio Description Mix Level in dB.
     *     A value of {@code Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY} means
     *     that the audio description is not mixed or
     *     the hardware is not available.
     *     This should reflect the <strong>true</strong> internal device mix level;
     *     hence the application might receive any floating value
     *     except {@code Float.NaN}.
