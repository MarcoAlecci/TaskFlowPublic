     * Compares the two specified {@code float} values. The sign
     * of the integer value returned is the same as that of the
     * integer that would be returned by the call:
     * <pre>
     *    new Float(f1).compareTo(new Float(f2))
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   f1        the first {@code float} to compare.
     * @param   f2        the second {@code float} to compare.
     * @return  the value {@code 0} if {@code f1} is
     *          numerically equal to {@code f2}; a value less than
     *          {@code 0} if {@code f1} is numerically less than
     *          {@code f2}; and a value greater than {@code 0}
     *          if {@code f1} is numerically greater than
     *          {@code f2}.
