     * Called whenever the receiver is passed new MIDI data.
     * Subclasses override this method to receive MIDI data.
     * May fail if count exceeds {@link #getMaxMessageSize}.
     *
     * NOTE: the msg array parameter is only valid within the context of this call.
     * The msg bytes should be copied by the receiver rather than retaining a reference
     * to this parameter.
     * Also, modifying the contents of the msg array parameter may result in other receivers
     * in the same application receiving incorrect values in their {link #onSend} method.
     *
     * @param msg a byte array containing the MIDI data
     * @param offset the offset of the first byte of the data in the array to be processed
     * @param count the number of bytes of MIDI data in the array to be processed
     * @param timestamp the timestamp of the message (based on {@link java.lang.System#nanoTime}
     * @throws IOException
