         * <ul>
         *     <li>Carrier apps with privileges for the relevant subscription
         *     <li>Active VPN apps
         *     <li>Other application groups with a particular Network-related role
         * </ul>
         *
         * <p>In general, user-supplied networks (such as WiFi networks) do not have
         * administrators.
         *
         * <p>An app is granted owner privileges over Networks that it supplies. The owner
         * UID MUST always be included in administratorUids.
         *
         * The default value is the empty array. Pass an empty array to reset.
