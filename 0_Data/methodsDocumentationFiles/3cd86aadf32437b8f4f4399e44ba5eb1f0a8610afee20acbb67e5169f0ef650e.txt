     * Control whether or not the SQLiteDatabase is made thread-safe by using locks
     * around critical sections. This is pretty expensive, so if you know that your
     * DB will only be used by a single thread then you should set this to false.
     * The default is true.
     * @param lockingEnabled set to true to enable locks, false otherwise
     *
     * @deprecated This method now does nothing.  Do not use.
