     * Call this method after setDataSource(). This method finds a
     * representative frame close to the given time position if possible,
     * and returns it as a bitmap. Call this method if one does not care
     * how the frame is found as long as it is close to the given time;
     * otherwise, please call {@link #getFrameAtTime(long, int)}.
     *
     * <p>If you don't need a full-resolution
     * frame (for example, because you need a thumbnail image), use
     * {@link #getScaledFrameAtTime getScaledFrameAtTime()} instead of this
     * method.</p>
     *
     * @param timeUs The time position where the frame will be retrieved.
     * When retrieving the frame at the given time position, there is no
     * guarentee that the data source has a frame located at the position.
     * When this happens, a frame nearby will be returned. If timeUs is
     * negative, time position and option will ignored, and any frame
     * that the implementation considers as representative may be returned.
     *
     * @return A Bitmap of size dst_widthxdst_height containing a representative
     *         video frame, which can be null, if such a frame cannot be retrieved.
     *
     * @see #getFrameAtTime(long, int)
