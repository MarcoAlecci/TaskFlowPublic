     * Sets the thread keep-alive time, which is the amount of time
     * that threads may remain idle before being terminated.
     * Threads that wait this amount of time without processing a
     * task will be terminated if there are more than the core
     * number of threads currently in the pool, or if this pool
     * {@linkplain #allowsCoreThreadTimeOut() allows core thread timeout}.
     * This overrides any value set in the constructor.
     *
     * @param time the time to wait.  A time value of zero will cause
     *        excess threads to terminate immediately after executing tasks.
     * @param unit the time unit of the {@code time} argument
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code time} less than zero or
     *         if {@code time} is zero and {@code allowsCoreThreadTimeOut}
