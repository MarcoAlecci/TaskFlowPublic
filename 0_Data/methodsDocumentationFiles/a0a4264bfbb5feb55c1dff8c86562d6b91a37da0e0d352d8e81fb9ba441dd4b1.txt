     * Returns whether animators are currently enabled, system-wide. By default, all
     * animators are enabled. This can change if either the user sets a Developer Option
     * to set the animator duration scale to 0 or by Battery Savery mode being enabled
     * (which disables all animations).
     *
     * <p>Developers should not typically need to call this method, but should an app wish
     * to show a different experience when animators are disabled, this return value
     * can be used as a decider of which experience to offer.
     *
     * @return boolean Whether animators are currently enabled. The default value is
     * <code>true</code>.
