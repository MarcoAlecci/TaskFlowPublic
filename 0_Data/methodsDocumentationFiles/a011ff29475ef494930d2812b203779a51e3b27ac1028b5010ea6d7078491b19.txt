     * Verify the cryptographic signature of a system update package
     * before installing it.  Note that the package is also verified
     * separately by the installer once the device is rebooted into
     * the recovery system.  This function will return only if the
     * package was successfully verified; otherwise it will throw an
     * exception.
     *
     * Verification of a package can take significant time, so this
     * function should not be called from a UI thread.  Interrupting
     * the thread while this function is in progress will result in a
     * SecurityException being thrown (and the thread's interrupt flag
     * will be cleared).
     *
     * @param packageFile  the package to be verified
     * @param listener     an object to receive periodic progress
     * updates as verification proceeds.  May be null.
     * @param deviceCertsZipFile  the zip file of certificates whose
     * public keys we will accept.  Verification succeeds if the
     * package is signed by the private key corresponding to any
     * public key in this file.  May be null to use the system default
     * file (currently "/system/etc/security/otacerts.zip").
     *
     * @throws IOException if there were any errors reading the
     * package or certs files.
     * @throws GeneralSecurityException if verification failed
