     * Returns a string representation of this server name, including the server
     * name type and the encoded server name value in this
     * {@code SNIServerName} object.
     * <P>
     * The exact details of the representation are unspecified and subject
     * to change, but the following may be regarded as typical:
     * <pre>
     *     "type={@literal <name type>}, value={@literal <name value>}"
     * </pre>
     * <P>
     * In this class, the format of "{@literal <name type>}" is
     * "[LITERAL] (INTEGER)", where the optional "LITERAL" is the literal
     * name, and INTEGER is the integer value of the name type.  The format
     * of "{@literal <name value>}" is "XX:...:XX", where "XX" is the
     * hexadecimal digit representation of a byte value. For example, a
     * returned value of an pseudo server name may look like:
     * <pre>
     *     "type=(31), value=77:77:77:2E:65:78:61:6D:70:6C:65:2E:63:6E"
     * </pre>
     * or
     * <pre>
     *     "type=host_name (0), value=77:77:77:2E:65:78:61:6D:70:6C:65:2E:63:6E"
     * </pre>
     *
     * <P>
     * Please NOTE that the exact details of the representation are unspecified
     * and subject to change, and subclasses may override the method with
     * their own formats.
