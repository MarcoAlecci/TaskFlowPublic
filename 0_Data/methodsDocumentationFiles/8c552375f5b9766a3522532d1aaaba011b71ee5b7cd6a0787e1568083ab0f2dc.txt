     * Tries to determine the type of an input stream based on the
     * characters at the beginning of the input stream. This method can
     * be used by subclasses that override the
     * {@code getContentType} method.
     * <p>
     * Ideally, this routine would not be needed. But many
     * {@code http} servers return the incorrect content type; in
     * addition, there are many nonstandard extensions. Direct inspection
     * of the bytes to determine the content type is often more accurate
     * than believing the content type claimed by the {@code http} server.
     *
     * @param      is   an input stream that supports marks.
     * @return     a guess at the content type, or {@code null} if none
     *             can be determined.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs while reading the
     *               input stream.
