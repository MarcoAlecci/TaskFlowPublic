     * <strong>Note:</strong> We keep one instance per interrogating thread since
     * the instance contains state which can lead to undesired thread interleavings.
     * We do not have a thread local variable since other threads should be able to
     * look up the correct client knowing a thread id. See ViewRootImpl for details.

     * @return The client for a given <code>threadId</code>.
