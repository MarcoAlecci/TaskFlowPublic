     * Called by a device or profile owner, or delegated certificate installer, to install a
     * certificate chain and corresponding private key for the leaf certificate. All apps within the
     * profile will be able to access the certificate chain and use the private key, given direct
     * user approval.
     *
     * <p>The caller of this API may grant itself access to the certificate and private key
     * immediately, without user approval. It is a best practice not to request this unless strictly
     * necessary since it opens up additional security vulnerabilities.
     *
     * <p>Note: If the provided {@code alias} is of an existing alias, all former grants that apps
     * have been given to access the key and certificates associated with this alias will be
     * revoked.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or
     *        {@code null} if calling from a delegated certificate installer.
     * @param privKey The private key to install.
     * @param certs The certificate chain to install. The chain should start with the leaf
     *        certificate and include the chain of trust in order. This will be returned by
     *        {@link android.security.KeyChain#getCertificateChain}.
     * @param alias The private key alias under which to install the certificate. If a certificate
     *        with that alias already exists, it will be overwritten.
     * @param requestAccess {@code true} to request that the calling app be granted access to the
     *        credentials immediately. Otherwise, access to the credentials will be gated by user
     *        approval.
     * @return {@code true} if the keys were installed, {@code false} otherwise.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not {@code null} and not a device or profile
     *         owner.
