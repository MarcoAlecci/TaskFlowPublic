     * New version of {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, long, android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor)}
     * that has a list of keys to be excluded from the restore. Key/value pairs for which the key
     * is present in {@code excludedKeys} have already been excluded from the restore data by the
     * system. The list is passed to the agent to make it aware of what data has been removed (in
     * case it has any application-level consequences) as well as the data that should be removed
     * by the agent itself.
     *
     * The default implementation calls {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, long,
     * android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor)}.
     *
     * @param excludedKeys A list of keys to be excluded from restore.
