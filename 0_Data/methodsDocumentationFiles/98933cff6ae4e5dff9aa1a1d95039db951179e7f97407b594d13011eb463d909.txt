     * @return true if the current device is "voice capable".
     * <p>
     * "Voice capable" means that this device supports circuit-switched
     * (i.e. voice) phone calls over the telephony network, and is allowed
     * to display the in-call UI while a cellular voice call is active.
     * This will be false on "data only" devices which can't make voice
     * calls and don't support any in-call UI.
     * <p>
     * Note: the meaning of this flag is subtly different from the
     * PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY system feature, which is available
     * on any device with a telephony radio, even if the device is
     * data-only.
