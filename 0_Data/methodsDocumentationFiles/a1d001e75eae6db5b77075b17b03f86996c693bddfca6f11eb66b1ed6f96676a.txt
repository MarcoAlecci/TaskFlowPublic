     * Called by Telecom to inform the {@link ConnectionService} that its request to create a new
     * incoming {@link Connection} was denied.
     * <p>
     * Used when a self-managed {@link ConnectionService} attempts to create a new incoming
     * {@link Connection}, but Telecom has determined that the call cannot be allowed at this time.
     * The {@link ConnectionService} is responsible for silently rejecting the new incoming
     * {@link Connection}.
