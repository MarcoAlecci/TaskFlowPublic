     * The multiplication factor for inhibiting default gestures.
     *
     * If a MotionEvent has {@link android.view.MotionEvent#CLASSIFICATION_AMBIGUOUS_GESTURE} set,
     * then certain actions, such as scrolling, will be inhibited. However, to account for the
     * possibility of an incorrect classification, existing gesture thresholds (e.g. scrolling
     * touch slop and the long-press timeout) should be scaled by this factor and remain in effect.
