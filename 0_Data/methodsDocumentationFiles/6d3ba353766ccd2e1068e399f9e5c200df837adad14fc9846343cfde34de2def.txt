         * Returns a string representation of this collection.
         * The string representation consists of the string representations
         * of the collection's elements in the order they are returned by
         * its iterator, enclosed in square brackets ({@code "[]"}).
         * Adjacent elements are separated by the characters {@code ", "}
         * (comma and space).  Elements are converted to strings as by
         * {@link String#valueOf(Object)}.
