     * This method is called by the system in various cases where picture in picture mode should be
     * entered if supported.
     *
     * <p>It is up to the app developer to choose whether to call
     * {@link #enterPictureInPictureMode(PictureInPictureParams)} at this time. For example, the
     * system will call this method when the activity is being put into the background, so the app
     * developer might want to switch an activity into PIP mode instead.</p>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the activity received this callback regardless of if it acts on it
     * or not. If {@code false}, the framework will assume the app hasn't been updated to leverage
     * this callback and will in turn send a legacy callback of {@link #onUserLeaveHint()} for the
     * app to enter picture-in-picture mode.
