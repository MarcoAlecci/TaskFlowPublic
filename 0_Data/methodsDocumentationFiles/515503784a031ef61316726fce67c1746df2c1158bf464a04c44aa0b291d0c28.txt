     * Request that a rectangle of this view be visible on the screen,
     * scrolling if necessary just enough.
     *
     * <p>A View should call this if it maintains some notion of which part
     * of its content is interesting.  For example, a text editing view
     * should call this when its cursor moves.
     * <p>The Rectangle passed into this method should be in the View's content coordinate space.
     * It should not be affected by which part of the View is currently visible or its scroll
     * position.
     *
     * @param rectangle The rectangle in the View's content coordinate space
     * @return Whether any parent scrolled.
