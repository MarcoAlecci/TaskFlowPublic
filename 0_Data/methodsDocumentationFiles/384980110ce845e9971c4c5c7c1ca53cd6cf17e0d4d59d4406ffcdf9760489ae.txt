     * Query for the capability of an IMS RCS service provided by the framework.
     * <p>
     * This only reports the status of RCS capabilities provided by the framework, not necessarily
     * RCS capabilities provided over-the-top by applications.
     *
     * @param capability The RCS capability to query.
     * @param radioTech The radio tech that this capability failed for, defined as
     * {@link ImsRegistrationImplBase#REGISTRATION_TECH_LTE} or
     * {@link ImsRegistrationImplBase#REGISTRATION_TECH_IWLAN}.
     * @return true if the RCS capability is capable for this subscription, false otherwise. This
     * does not necessarily mean that we are registered for IMS and the capability is available, but
     * rather the subscription is capable of this service over IMS.
     * @see #isAvailable(int)
     * @see android.telephony.CarrierConfigManager#KEY_USE_RCS_PRESENCE_BOOL
     * @throws ImsException if the IMS service is not available when calling this method.
     * See {@link ImsException#getCode()} for more information on the error codes.
