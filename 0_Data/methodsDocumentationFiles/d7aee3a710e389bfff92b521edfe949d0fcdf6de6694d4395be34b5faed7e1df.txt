     * Write a single proto "int32" type field value.
     *
     * <p>Note that these are stored in memory as signed values and written as unsigned
     * varints, which if negative, are 10 bytes long. If you know the data is likely
     * to be negative, use "sint32".
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #write(long, int)} instead.
