     * Called when the activity needs its list of headers build.  By
     * implementing this and adding at least one item to the list, you
     * will cause the activity to run in its modern fragment mode.  Note
     * that this function may not always be called; for example, if the
     * activity has been asked to display a particular fragment without
     * the header list, there is no need to build the headers.
     *
     * <p>Typical implementations will use {@link #loadHeadersFromResource}
     * to fill in the list from a resource.
     *
     * @param target The list in which to place the headers.
