     * @deprecated This method returns true if there are any 3gpp type SignalStrength elements in
     *             this SignalStrength report or if the report contains no valid SignalStrength
     *             information. Instead callers should use
     *             {@link android.telephony.SignalStrength#getCellSignalStrengths
     *             getCellSignalStrengths()} to determine which types of information are contained
     *             in the SignalStrength report.
