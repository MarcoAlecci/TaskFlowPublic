     * Return information about who launched this activity.  If the launching Intent
     * contains an {@link android.content.Intent#EXTRA_REFERRER Intent.EXTRA_REFERRER},
     * that will be returned as-is; otherwise, if known, an
     * {@link Intent#URI_ANDROID_APP_SCHEME android-app:} referrer URI containing the
     * package name that started the Intent will be returned.  This may return null if no
     * referrer can be identified -- it is neither explicitly specified, nor is it known which
     * application package was involved.
     *
     * <p>If called while inside the handling of {@link #onNewIntent}, this function will
     * return the referrer that submitted that new intent to the activity.  Otherwise, it
     * always returns the referrer of the original Intent.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that this is <em>not</em> a security feature -- you can not trust the
     * referrer information, applications can spoof it.</p>
