         * This method is called when the buffer pre-allocation for an output Surface is complete.
         *
         * <p>Buffer pre-allocation for an output Surface is started by the {@link #prepare} call.
         * While allocation is underway, the Surface must not be used as a capture target.
         * Once this callback fires, the output Surface provided can again be used as a target for
         * a capture request.</p>
         *
         * <p>In case of a error during pre-allocation (such as running out of suitable memory),
         * this callback is still invoked after the error is encountered, though some buffers may
         * not have been successfully pre-allocated.</p>
         *
         * @param session the session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
         * @param surface the Surface that was used with the {@link #prepare} call.
