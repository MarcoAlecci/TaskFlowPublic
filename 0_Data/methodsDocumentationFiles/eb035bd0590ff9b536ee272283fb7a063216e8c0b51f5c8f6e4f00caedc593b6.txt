         * Checks if the specified app can modify system settings. As of API
         * level 23, an app cannot modify system settings unless it declares the
         * {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_SETTINGS}
         * permission in its manifest, <em>and</em> the user specifically grants
         * the app this capability. To prompt the user to grant this approval,
         * the app must send an intent with the action {@link
         * android.provider.Settings#ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS}, which causes
         * the system to display a permission management screen.
         *
         * @param context App context.
         * @return true if the calling app can write to system settings, false otherwise
