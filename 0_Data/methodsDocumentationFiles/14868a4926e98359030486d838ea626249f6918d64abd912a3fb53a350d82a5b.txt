     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} whose value is {@code this * 10<sup>n</sup>}.
     * The scale of the result is {@code this.scale()} - {@code n}.
     * The precision of the result is the precision of {@code this}.
     *
     * <p>This method has the same effect as {@link #movePointRight}, except that
     * the precision is not changed.
