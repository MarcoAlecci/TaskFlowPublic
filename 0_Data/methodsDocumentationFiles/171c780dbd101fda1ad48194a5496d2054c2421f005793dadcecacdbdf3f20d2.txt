     * Gets the approximate amount of memory allocated for the RenderNode for debug purposes.
     * Does not include the memory allocated by any child RenderNodes nor any bitmaps, only the
     * memory allocated for this RenderNode and any data it owns.
     *
     * The difference between this and {@link #computeApproximateMemoryUsage()} is this includes
     * memory allocated but not used. In particular structures such as DisplayLists are similar
     * to things like ArrayLists - they need to resize as commands are added to them. As such,
     * memory used can be less than memory allocated.
