     * Based on <code>oldState</code>, determine which of the files from the
     * application's data directory need to be backed up, write them to the data
     * stream, and fill in <code>newState</code> with the state as it exists
     * now. When <code>oldState</code> is <code>null</code>, all the files will
     * be backed up.
     * <p>
     * This should only be called directly from within the {@link BackupAgentHelper}
     * implementation. See
     * {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent#onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor, BackupDataOutput, ParcelFileDescriptor)}
     * for a description of parameter meanings.
