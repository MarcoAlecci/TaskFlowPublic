         * Sets the address of an HTTP proxy for the APN. The proxy address can be an IP address or
         * hostname. If {@code proxy} contains both an IP address and hostname, this method ignores
         * the IP address.
         *
         * <p>The {@link java.net.InetAddress} methods
         * {@link java.net.InetAddress#getAllByName getAllByName()} require DNS for hostname
         * resolution. To avoid this requirement when setting a hostname, call
         * {@link java.net.InetAddress#getByAddress(java.lang.String, byte[])} with both the
         * hostname and a dummy IP address. See {@link ApnSetting.Builder above} for an example.
         *
         * @param proxy the proxy address to set for the APN
         * @deprecated use {@link #setProxyAddress(String)} instead.
