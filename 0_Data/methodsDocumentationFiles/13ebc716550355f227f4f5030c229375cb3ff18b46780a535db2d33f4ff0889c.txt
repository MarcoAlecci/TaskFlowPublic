     * further and longer, when used with {@link #setFinalX(int)} or {@link #setFinalY(int)}.

     * @deprecated OverScrollers don't necessarily have a fixed duration.
     *             Instead of setting a new final position and extending
     *             the duration of an existing scroll, use startScroll
     *             to begin a new animation.
