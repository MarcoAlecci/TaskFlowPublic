     * This allows clients to request an explicit refresh of content identified
     * by {@code uri}.
     * <p>
     * Client code should only invoke this method when there is a strong
     * indication (such as a user initiated pull to refresh gesture) that the
     * content is stale.
     * <p>
     *
     * @param url The Uri identifying the data to refresh.
     * @param extras Additional options from the client. The definitions of
     *            these are specific to the content provider being called.
     * @param cancellationSignal A signal to cancel the operation in progress,
     *            or {@code null} if none. For example, if you called refresh on
     *            a particular uri, you should call
     *            {@link CancellationSignal#throwIfCanceled()} to check whether
     *            the client has canceled the refresh request.
     * @return true if the provider actually tried refreshing.
