     * Return a new matrix with a copy of the canvas' current transformation
     * matrix.

     * @deprecated {@link #isHardwareAccelerated() Hardware accelerated} canvases may have any
     * matrix when passed to a View or Drawable, as it is implementation defined where in the
     * hierarchy such canvases are created. It is recommended in such cases to either draw contents
     * irrespective of the current matrix, or to track relevant transform state outside of the
     * canvas.
