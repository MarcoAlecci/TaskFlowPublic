     * Returns the raw type of T.
     *
     * <p><ul>
     * <li>If T is a Class itself, T itself is returned.
     * <li>If T is a ParameterizedType, the raw type of the parameterized type is returned.
     * <li>If T is a GenericArrayType, the returned type is the corresponding array class.
     * For example: {@code List<Integer>[]} => {@code List[]}.
     * <li>If T is a type variable or a wildcard type, the raw type of the first upper bound is
     * returned. For example: {@code <X extends Foo>} => {@code Foo}.
