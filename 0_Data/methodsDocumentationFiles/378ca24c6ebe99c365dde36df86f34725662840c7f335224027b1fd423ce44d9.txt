     * Sets whether the data on this node is sensitive; if it is, then its content (text, autofill
     * value, etc..) is striped before calls to {@link
     * android.service.autofill.AutofillService#onFillRequest(android.service.autofill.FillRequest,
     * android.os.CancellationSignal, android.service.autofill.FillCallback)}.
     *
     * <p>By default, all nodes are assumed to be sensitive, and only nodes that does not have PII
     * (Personally Identifiable Information - sensitive data such as email addresses, credit card
     * numbers, passwords, etc...) should be marked as non-sensitive; a good rule of thumb is to
     * mark as non-sensitive nodes whose value were statically set from resources.
     *
     * <p>Notice that the content of even sensitive nodes are sent to the service (through the
     * {@link
     * android.service.autofill.AutofillService#onSaveRequest(android.service.autofill.SaveRequest,
     * android.service.autofill.SaveCallback)} call) when the user consented to save
     * thedata, so it is important to set the content of sensitive nodes as well, but mark them as
     * sensitive.
     *
     * <p>Should only be set when the node is used for autofill purposes - it will be ignored
     * when used for Assist.
