     * Gets the windows on the screen of the default display. This method returns only the windows
     * that a sighted user can interact with, as opposed to all windows.
     * For example, if there is a modal dialog shown and the user cannot touch
     * anything behind it, then only the modal window will be reported
     * (assuming it is the top one). For convenience the returned windows
     * are ordered in a descending layer order, which is the windows that
     * are on top are reported first. Since the user can always
     * interact with the window that has input focus by typing, the focused
     * window is always returned (even if covered by a modal window).
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> In order to access the windows your service has
     * to declare the capability to retrieve window content by setting the
     * {@link android.R.styleable#AccessibilityService_canRetrieveWindowContent}
     * property in its meta-data. For details refer to {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA}.
     * Also the service has to opt-in to retrieve the interactive windows by
     * setting the {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#FLAG_RETRIEVE_INTERACTIVE_WINDOWS}
     * flag.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return The windows if there are windows and the service is can retrieve
     *         them, otherwise an empty list.
