     * <p>This value can be reliably compared to
     * {@link android.os.SystemClock#elapsedRealtimeNanos},
     * to calculate the age of a fix and to compare Location fixes. This
     * is reliable because elapsed real-time is guaranteed monotonic for
     * each system boot and continues to increment even when the system
     * is in deep sleep (unlike {@link #getTime}.
     *
     * <p>All locations generated by the {@link LocationManager}
     * are guaranteed to have a valid elapsed real-time.

     * @return elapsed real-time of fix, in nanoseconds since system boot.
