     * Enable or disable the splitting of MotionEvents to multiple children during touch event
     * dispatch. This behavior is enabled by default for applications that target an
     * SDK version of {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB} or newer.
     *
     * <p>When this option is enabled MotionEvents may be split and dispatched to different child
     * views depending on where each pointer initially went down. This allows for user interactions
     * such as scrolling two panes of content independently, chording of buttons, and performing
     * independent gestures on different pieces of content.
     *
     * @param split <code>true</code> to allow MotionEvents to be split and dispatched to multiple
     *              child views. <code>false</code> to only allow one child view to be the target of
     *              any MotionEvent received by this ViewGroup.
     * @attr ref android.R.styleable#ViewGroup_splitMotionEvents
