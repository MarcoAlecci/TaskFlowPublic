     * Called when an utterance has been stopped while in progress or flushed from the
     * synthesis queue. This can happen if a client calls {@link TextToSpeech#stop()}
     * or uses {@link TextToSpeech#QUEUE_FLUSH} as an argument with the
     * {@link TextToSpeech#speak} or {@link TextToSpeech#synthesizeToFile} methods.
     *
     * @param utteranceId The utterance ID of the utterance.
     * @param interrupted If true, then the utterance was interrupted while being synthesized
     *        and its output is incomplete. If false, then the utterance was flushed
     *        before the synthesis started.
