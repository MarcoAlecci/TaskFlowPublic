     * Adds a network address to the VPN interface.
     *
     * Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. The VPN must already be established. Fails if the
     * address is already in use or cannot be assigned to the interface for any other reason.
     *
     * Adding an address implicitly allows traffic from that address family (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6) to
     * be routed over the VPN. @see Builder#allowFamily
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the address is invalid.
     *
     * @param address The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) to assign to the VPN interface.
     * @param prefixLength The prefix length of the address.
     *
     * @return {@code true} on success.
