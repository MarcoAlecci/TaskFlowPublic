     * Generate a new description for this activity.  This method is called
     * before stopping the activity and can, if desired, return some textual
     * description of its current state to be displayed to the user.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation returns null, which will cause you to
     * inherit the description from the previous activity.  If all activities
     * return null, generally the label of the top activity will be used as the
     * description.
     *
     * @return A description of what the user is doing.  It should be short and
     *         sweet (only a few words).
