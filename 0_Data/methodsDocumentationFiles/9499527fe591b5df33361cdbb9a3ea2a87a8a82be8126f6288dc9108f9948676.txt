         * This method is called independently of the others in CaptureCallback,
         * when a capture sequence finishes and all {@link CaptureResult}
         * or {@link CaptureFailure} for it have been returned via this listener.
         *
         * <p>In total, there will be at least one result/failure returned by this listener
         * before this callback is invoked. If the capture sequence is aborted before any
         * requests have been processed, {@link #onCaptureSequenceAborted} is invoked instead.</p>
         *
         * <p>The default implementation does nothing.</p>

         * @param session
         *            The session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
         * @param sequenceId
         *            A sequence ID returned by the {@link #capture} family of functions.
         * @param frameNumber
         *            The last frame number (returned by {@link CaptureResult#getFrameNumber}
         *            or {@link CaptureFailure#getFrameNumber}) in the capture sequence.
