     * Sets the hints that help an {@link android.service.autofill.AutofillService} determine how
     * to autofill the view with the user's data.
     *
     * <p>Typically, there is only one way to autofill a view, but there could be more than one.
     * For example, if the application accepts either an username or email address to identify
     * an user.
     *
     * <p>These hints are not validated by the Android System, but passed "as is" to the service.
     * Hence, they can have any value, but it's recommended to use the {@code AUTOFILL_HINT_}
     * constants such as:
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_USERNAME}, {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_PASSWORD},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_EMAIL_ADDRESS},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_NAME},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_PHONE},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_POSTAL_ADDRESS}, {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_POSTAL_CODE},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER}, {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_CREDIT_CARD_SECURITY_CODE},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION_DATE},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION_DAY},
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION_MONTH} or
     * {@link #AUTOFILL_HINT_CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION_YEAR}.
     *
     * @param autofillHints The autofill hints to set. If the array is emtpy, {@code null} is set.
