     * Create a new Android Application Record (AAR).
     * <p>
     * This record indicates to other Android devices the package
     * that should be used to handle the entire NDEF message.
     * You can embed this record anywhere into your message
     * to ensure that the intended package receives the message.
     * <p>
     * When an Android device dispatches an {@link NdefMessage}
     * containing one or more Android application records,
     * the applications contained in those records will be the
     * preferred target for the {@link NfcAdapter#ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED}
     * intent, in the order in which they appear in the message.
     * This dispatch behavior was first added to Android in
     * Ice Cream Sandwich.
     * <p>
     * If none of the applications have a are installed on the device,
     * a Market link will be opened to the first application.
     * <p>
     * Note that Android application records do not overrule
     * applications that have called
     * {@link NfcAdapter#enableForegroundDispatch}.
