     * Converts this {@code FileTime} object to an {@code Instant}.
     *
     * <p> The conversion creates an {@code Instant} that represents the
     * same point on the time-line as this {@code FileTime}.
     *
     * <p> {@code FileTime} can store points on the time-line further in the
     * future and further in the past than {@code Instant}. Conversion
     * from such further time points saturates to {@link Instant#MIN} if
     * earlier than {@code Instant.MIN} or {@link Instant#MAX} if later
     * than {@code Instant.MAX}.
     *
     * @return  an instant representing the same point on the time-line as
     *          this {@code FileTime} object
