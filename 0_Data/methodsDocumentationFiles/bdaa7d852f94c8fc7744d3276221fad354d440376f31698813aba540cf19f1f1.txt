     * Unregisters a {@code NetworkCallback} and possibly releases networks originating from
     * {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)} and
     * {@link #registerNetworkCallback(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)} calls.
     * If the given {@code NetworkCallback} had previously been used with
     * {@code #requestNetwork}, any networks that had been connected to only to satisfy that request
     * will be disconnected.
     *
     * Notifications that would have triggered that {@code NetworkCallback} will immediately stop
     * triggering it as soon as this call returns.
     *
     * @param networkCallback The {@link NetworkCallback} used when making the request.
