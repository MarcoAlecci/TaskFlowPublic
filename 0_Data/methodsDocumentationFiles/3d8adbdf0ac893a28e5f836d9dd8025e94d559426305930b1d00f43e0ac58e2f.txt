     * Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern ignoring
     * delimiters. If the pattern is found before the next line separator, the
     * scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string that
     * matched the pattern.
     * If no such pattern is detected in the input up to the next line
     * separator, then <code>null</code> is returned and the scanner's
     * position is unchanged. This method may block waiting for input that
     * matches the pattern.
     *
     * <p>Since this method continues to search through the input looking
     * for the specified pattern, it may buffer all of the input searching for
     * the desired token if no line separators are present.

     * @param pattern the pattern to scan for
     * @return the text that matched the specified pattern
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this scanner is closed
