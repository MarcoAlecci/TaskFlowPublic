     * Verify that this is a suitable time for a full-data backup pass.  This should return zero
     * if a backup is reasonable right now, some positive value otherwise.  This method
     * will be called outside of the {@link #performFullBackup}/{@link #finishBackup} pair.
     *
     * <p>If this is not a suitable time for a backup, the transport should return a
     * backoff delay, in milliseconds, after which the Backup Manager should try again.
     *
     * @return Zero if this is a suitable time for a backup pass, or a positive time delay
     *   in milliseconds to suggest deferring the backup pass for a while.
