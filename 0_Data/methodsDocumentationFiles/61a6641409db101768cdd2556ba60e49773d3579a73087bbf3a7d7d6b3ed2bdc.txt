     * Returns the absolute path to the application specific cache directory on
     * the filesystem designed for storing cached code.
     * <p>
     * The system will delete any files stored in this location both when your
     * specific application is upgraded, and when the entire platform is
     * upgraded.
     * <p>
     * This location is optimal for storing compiled or optimized code generated
     * by your application at runtime.
     * <p>
     * The returned path may change over time if the calling app is moved to an
     * adopted storage device, so only relative paths should be persisted.
     * <p>
     * Apps require no extra permissions to read or write to the returned path,
     * since this path lives in their private storage.
     *
     * @return The path of the directory holding application code cache files.
