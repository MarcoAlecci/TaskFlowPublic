     * Informs the system whether it should switch to {@code network} regardless of whether it is
     * validated or not. If {@code accept} is true, and the network was explicitly selected by the
     * user (e.g., by selecting a Wi-Fi network in the Settings app), then the network will become
     * the system default network regardless of any other network that's currently connected. If
     * {@code always} is true, then the choice is remembered, so that the next time the user
     * connects to this network, the system will switch to it.
     *
     * @param network The network to accept.
     * @param accept Whether to accept the network even if unvalidated.
     * @param always Whether to remember this choice in the future.
