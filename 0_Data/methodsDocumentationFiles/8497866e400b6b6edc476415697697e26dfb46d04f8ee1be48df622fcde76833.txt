     * Initializes this exemption mechanism with a key.
     *
     * <p>If this exemption mechanism requires any algorithm parameters
     * that cannot be derived from the given <code>key</code>, the
     * underlying exemption mechanism implementation is supposed to
     * generate the required parameters itself (using provider-specific
     * default values); in the case that algorithm parameters must be
     * specified by the caller, an <code>InvalidKeyException</code> is raised.
     *
     * @param key the key for this exemption mechanism
     *
     * @exception InvalidKeyException if the given key is inappropriate for
     * this exemption mechanism.
     * @exception ExemptionMechanismException if problem(s) encountered in the
     * process of initializing.
