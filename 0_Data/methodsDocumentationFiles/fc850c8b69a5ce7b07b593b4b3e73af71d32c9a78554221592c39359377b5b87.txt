     * <p>
     * A state description briefly describes the states of the view and is primarily used
     * for accessibility support to determine how the states of a view should be presented to
     * the user. It is a supplement to the boolean states (for example, checked/unchecked) and
     * it is used for customized state description (for example, "wifi, connected, three bars").
     * State description changes frequently while content description should change less often.
     * State description should be localized. For android widgets which have default state
     * descriptions, app developers can call this method to override the state descriptions.
     * Setting state description to null restores the default behavior.
     *
     * @param stateDescription The state description.
