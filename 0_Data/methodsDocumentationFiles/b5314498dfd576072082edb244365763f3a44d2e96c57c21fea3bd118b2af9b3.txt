     * Sets the grant state of a runtime permission for a specific application. The state can be
     * {@link #PERMISSION_GRANT_STATE_DEFAULT default} in which a user can manage it through the UI,
     * {@link #PERMISSION_GRANT_STATE_DENIED denied}, in which the permission is denied and the user
     * cannot manage it through the UI, and {@link #PERMISSION_GRANT_STATE_GRANTED granted} in which
     * the permission is granted and the user cannot manage it through the UI. This method can only
     * be called by a profile owner, device owner, or a delegate given the
     * {@link #DELEGATION_PERMISSION_GRANT} scope via {@link #setDelegatedScopes}.
     * <p/>
     * Note that user cannot manage other permissions in the affected group through the UI
     * either and their granted state will be kept as the current value. Thus, it's recommended that
     * you set the grant state of all the permissions in the affected group.
     * <p/>
     * Setting the grant state to {@link #PERMISSION_GRANT_STATE_DEFAULT default} does not revoke
     * the permission. It retains the previous grant, if any.
     * <p/>
     * Device admins with a {@code targetSdkVersion} &lt; {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}
     * cannot grant and revoke permissions for applications built with a {@code targetSdkVersion}
     * &lt; {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M}.
     * <p/>
     * Admins with a {@code targetSdkVersion} &ge; {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q} can
     * grant and revoke permissions of all apps. Similar to the user revoking a permission from a
     * application built with a {@code targetSdkVersion} &lt;
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M} the app-op matching the permission is set to
     * {@link android.app.AppOpsManager#MODE_IGNORED}, but the permission stays granted.
