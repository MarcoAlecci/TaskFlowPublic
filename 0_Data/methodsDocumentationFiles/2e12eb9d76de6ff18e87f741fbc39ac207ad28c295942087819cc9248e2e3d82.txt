     * Is this device in the process of being block encrypted?
     * @return true for encrypting.
     *         false otherwise
     * Whether device isEncrypted at this point is undefined

     * Also note that this state will not change without a teardown of the
     * framework, so no service needs to check for changes during their lifespan
