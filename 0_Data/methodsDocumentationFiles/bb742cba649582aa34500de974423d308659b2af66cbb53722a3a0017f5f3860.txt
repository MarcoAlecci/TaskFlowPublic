     * The audio mode encompasses audio routing AND the behavior of
     * the telephony layer. Therefore this method should only be used by applications that
     * replace the platform-wide management of audio settings or the main telephony application.
     * In particular, the {@link #MODE_IN_CALL} mode should only be used by the telephony
     * application when it places a phone call, as it will cause signals from the radio layer
     * to feed the platform mixer.
