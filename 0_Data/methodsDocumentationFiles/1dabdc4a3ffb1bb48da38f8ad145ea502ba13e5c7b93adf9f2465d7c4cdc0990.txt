     * the name of the host from the system, then resolving that name into
     * an {@code InetAddress}.

     * <p>If there is a security manager, its
     * {@code checkConnect} method is called
     * with the local host name and {@code -1}
     * as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed.
     * If the operation is not allowed, an InetAddress representing
     * the loopback address is returned.
     *
     * @return     the address of the local host.
     *
     * @exception  UnknownHostException  if the local host name could not
     *             be resolved into an address.
