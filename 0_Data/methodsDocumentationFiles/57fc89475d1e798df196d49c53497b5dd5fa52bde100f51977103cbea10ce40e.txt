     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This method is intended for internal use by carrier
     * applications or the Telephony framework and will never trigger an SMS disambiguation
     * dialog. If this method is called on a device that has multiple active subscriptions, this
     * {@link SmsManager} instance has been created with {@link #getDefault()}, and no user-defined
     * default subscription is defined, the subscription ID associated with this message will be
     * INVALID, which will result in the operation being completed on the subscription associated
     * with logical slot 0. Use {@link #getSmsManagerForSubscriptionId(int)} to ensure the
     * operation is performed on the correct subscription.
