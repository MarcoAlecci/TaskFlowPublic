     * If the specified rectangle intersects this rectangle, return true and set
     * this rectangle to that intersection, otherwise return false and do not
     * change this rectangle. No check is performed to see if either rectangle
     * is empty. To just test for intersection, use intersects()
     *
     * @param r The rectangle being intersected with this rectangle.
     * @return true if the specified rectangle and this rectangle intersect
     *              (and this rectangle is then set to that intersection) else
     *              return false and do not change this rectangle.
