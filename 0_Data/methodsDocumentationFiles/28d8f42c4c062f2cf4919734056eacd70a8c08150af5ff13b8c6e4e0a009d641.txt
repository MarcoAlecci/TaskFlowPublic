     * <p>Returns the name of this color space. The name is never null
     * and contains always at least 1 character.</p>
     *
     * <p>Color space names are recommended to be unique but are not
     * guaranteed to be. There is no defined format but the name usually
     * falls in one of the following categories:</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Generic names used to identify color spaces in non-RGB
     *     color models. For instance: {@link Named#CIE_LAB Generic L*a*b*}.</li>
     *     <li>Names tied to a particular specification. For instance:
     *     {@link Named#SRGB sRGB IEC61966-2.1} or
     *     {@link Named#ACES SMPTE ST 2065-1:2012 ACES}.</li>
     *     <li>Ad-hoc names, often generated procedurally or by the user
     *     during a calibration workflow. These names often contain the
     *     make and model of the display.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Because the format of color space names is not defined, it is
     * not recommended to programmatically identify a color space by its
     * name alone. Names can be used as a first approximation.</p>
     *
     * <p>It is however perfectly acceptable to display color space names to
     * users in a UI, or in debuggers and logs. When displaying a color space
     * name to the user, it is recommended to add extra information to avoid
     * ambiguities: color model, a representation of the color space's gamut,
     * white point, etc.</p>
