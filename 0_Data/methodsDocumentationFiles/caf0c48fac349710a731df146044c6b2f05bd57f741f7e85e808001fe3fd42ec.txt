     * Called after {@link #performFullBackup} to make sure that the transport is willing to
     * handle a full-data backup operation of the specified size on the current package.
     * If the transport returns anything other than TRANSPORT_OK, the package's backup
     * operation will be skipped (and {@link #finishBackup() invoked} with no data for that
     * package being passed to {@link #sendBackupData}.
     *
     * <p class="note">The platform does no size-based rejection of full backup attempts on
     * its own: it is always the responsibility of the transport to implement its own policy.
     * In particular, even if the preflighted payload size is zero, the platform will still call
     * this method and will proceed to back up an archive metadata header with no file content
     * if this method returns TRANSPORT_OK.  To avoid storing such payloads the transport
     * must recognize this case and return TRANSPORT_PACKAGE_REJECTED.
     *
     * Added in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M}.

     * @param size The estimated size of the full-data payload for this app.  This includes
     *         manifest and archive format overhead, but is not guaranteed to be precise.
     * @return TRANSPORT_OK if the platform is to proceed with the full-data backup,
     *         TRANSPORT_PACKAGE_REJECTED if the proposed payload size is too large for
     *         the transport to handle, or TRANSPORT_ERROR to indicate a fatal error
     *         condition that means the platform cannot perform a backup at this time.
