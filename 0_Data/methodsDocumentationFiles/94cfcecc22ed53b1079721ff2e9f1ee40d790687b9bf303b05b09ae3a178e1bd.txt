     * This method begins an asynchronous query. When the query is done
     * {@link #onQueryComplete} is called.
     *
     * @param token A token passed into {@link #onQueryComplete} to identify
     *  the query.
     * @param cookie An object that gets passed into {@link #onQueryComplete}
     * @param uri The URI, using the content:// scheme, for the content to
     *         retrieve.
     * @param projection A list of which columns to return. Passing null will
     *         return all columns, which is discouraged to prevent reading data
     *         from storage that isn't going to be used.
     * @param selection A filter declaring which rows to return, formatted as an
     *         SQL WHERE clause (excluding the WHERE itself). Passing null will
     *         return all rows for the given URI.
     * @param selectionArgs You may include ?s in selection, which will be
     *         replaced by the values from selectionArgs, in the order that they
     *         appear in the selection. The values will be bound as Strings.
     * @param orderBy How to order the rows, formatted as an SQL ORDER BY
     *         clause (excluding the ORDER BY itself). Passing null will use the
     *         default sort order, which may be unordered.
