     * This is the entry point for a Zygote process.  It creates the Zygote server, loads resources,
     * and handles other tasks related to preparing the process for forking into applications.
     *
     * This process is started with a nice value of -20 (highest priority).  All paths that flow
     * into new processes are required to either set the priority to the default value or terminate
     * before executing any non-system code.  The native side of this occurs in SpecializeCommon,
     * while the Java Language priority is changed in ZygoteInit.handleSystemServerProcess,
     * ZygoteConnection.handleChildProc, and Zygote.usapMain.
     *
     * @param argv  Command line arguments used to specify the Zygote's configuration.
