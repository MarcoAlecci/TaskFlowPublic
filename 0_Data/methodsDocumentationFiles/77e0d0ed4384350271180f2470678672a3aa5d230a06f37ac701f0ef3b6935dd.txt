         * Sets the optional bearer specific network specifier.
         * This has no meaning if a single transport is also not specified, so calling
         * this without a single transport set will generate an exception, as will
         * subsequently adding or removing transports after this is set.

         * If the {@code networkSpecifier} is provided, it shall be interpreted as follows:
         * <ul>
         * <li>If the specifier can be parsed as an integer, it will be treated as a
         * {@link android.net TelephonyNetworkSpecifier}, and the provided integer will be
         * interpreted as a SubscriptionId.
         * <li>If the value is an ethernet interface name, it will be treated as such.
         * <li>For all other cases, the behavior is undefined.
         * </ul>
         *
         * @param networkSpecifier A {@code String} of either a SubscriptionId in cellular
         *                         network request or an ethernet interface name in ethernet
         *                         network request.
