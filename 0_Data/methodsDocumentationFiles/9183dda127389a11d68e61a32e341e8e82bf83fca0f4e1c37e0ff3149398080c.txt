     * Register a callback to be invoked when a new image frame becomes available to the
     * SurfaceTexture.
     * <p>
     * The callback may be called on an arbitrary thread, so it is not
     * safe to call {@link #updateTexImage} without first binding the OpenGL ES context to the
     * thread invoking the callback.
     * </p>

     * @param listener The listener to use, or null to remove the listener.
