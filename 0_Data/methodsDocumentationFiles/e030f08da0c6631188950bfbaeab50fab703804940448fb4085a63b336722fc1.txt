     * Enables you to lock or unlock the keyguard. Get an instance of this class by
     * calling {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService(java.lang.String) Context.getSystemService()}.
     * This class is wrapped by {@link android.app.KeyguardManager KeyguardManager}.
     * @param tag A tag that informally identifies who you are (for debugging who
     *   is disabling the keyguard).
     *
     * @return A {@link KeyguardLock} handle to use to disable and reenable the
     *   keyguard.
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link LayoutParams#FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD}
     *   and/or {@link LayoutParams#FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED}
     *   instead; this allows you to seamlessly hide the keyguard as your application
     *   moves in and out of the foreground and does not require that any special
     *   permissions be requested.
