     * Instructs this {@code Call} to continue playing a post-dial DTMF string.
     *
     * A post-dial DTMF string is a string of digits entered after a phone number, when dialed,
     * that are immediately sent as DTMF tones to the recipient as soon as the connection is made.
     *
     * If the DTMF string contains a {@link TelecomManager#DTMF_CHARACTER_PAUSE} symbol, this
     * {@code Call} will temporarily pause playing the tones for a pre-defined period of time.
     *
     * If the DTMF string contains a {@link TelecomManager#DTMF_CHARACTER_WAIT} symbol, this
     * {@code Call} will pause playing the tones and notify callbacks via
     * {@link Callback#onPostDialWait(Call, String)}. At this point, the in-call app
     * should display to the user an indication of this state and an affordance to continue
     * the postdial sequence. When the user decides to continue the postdial sequence, the in-call
     * app should invoke the {@link #postDialContinue(boolean)} method.
     *
     * @param proceed Whether or not to continue with the post-dial sequence.
