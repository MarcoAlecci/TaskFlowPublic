     * Convenience method that efficiently loads a visual thumbnail for the
     * given {@link Uri}. Internally calls
     * {@link ContentProvider#openTypedAssetFile} on the remote provider, but
     * also defensively resizes any returned content to match the requested
     * target size.
     *
     * @param uri The item that should be visualized as a thumbnail.
     * @param size The target area on the screen where this thumbnail will be
     *            shown. This is passed to the provider as {@link #EXTRA_SIZE}
     *            to help it avoid downloading or generating heavy resources.
     * @param signal A signal to cancel the operation in progress.
     * @return Valid {@link Bitmap} which is a visual thumbnail.
     * @throws IOException If any trouble was encountered while generating or
     *             loading the thumbnail, or if
     *             {@link CancellationSignal#cancel()} was invoked.
