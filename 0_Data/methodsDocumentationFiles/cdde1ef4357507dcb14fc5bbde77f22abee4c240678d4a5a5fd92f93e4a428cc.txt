     * Sets the source to be a virtual descendant of the given <code>root</code>.
     * If <code>virtualDescendantId</code> equals to {@link View#NO_ID} the root
     * is set as the source.
     * <p>
     * A virtual descendant is an imaginary View that is reported as a part of the view
     * hierarchy for accessibility purposes. This enables custom views that draw complex
     * content to report them selves as a tree of virtual views, thus conveying their
     * logical structure.

     *
     * @param root The root of the virtual subtree.
     * @param virtualDescendantId The id of the virtual descendant.
