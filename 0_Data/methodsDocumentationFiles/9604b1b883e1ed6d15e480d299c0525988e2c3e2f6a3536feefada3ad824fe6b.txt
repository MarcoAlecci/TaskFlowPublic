             * <p><b>DO NOT USE</b> this method.
             * This feature has negative side effects that are very hard to foresee.
             * <p>A connection timeout allows the system to internally close a connection to
             * a SQLite database after a given timeout, which is good for reducing app's memory
             * consumption.
             * <b>However</b> the side effect is it <b>will reset all of SQLite's per-connection
             * states</b>, which are typically modified with a {@code PRAGMA} statement, and
             * these states <b>will not be restored</b> when a connection is re-established
             * internally, and the system does not provide a callback for an app to reconfigure a
             * connection.
             * This feature may only be used if an app relies on none of such per-connection states.
             *
             * @param idleConnectionTimeoutMs timeout in milliseconds. Use {@link Long#MAX_VALUE}
