     *
     * It is used to set initial timestamp and enable time filtering. Once set, the time will be
     * increased automatically like a clock. Contents are discarded if their timestamps are
     * older than the time in the time filter.
     *
     * This method can be called more than once to reset the initial timestamp.
     *
     * @param timestamp initial timestamp for the time filter before it's increased. It's
     * based on the 90KHz counter, and it's the same format as PTS (Presentation Time Stamp)
     * defined in ISO/IEC 13818-1:2019. The timestamps may or may not be related to PTS or DTS.
     * @return result status of the operation.
