     * a SecurityException will be thrown. This method is not available to managed profile owners.
     * <p>
     * While some policies previously set by the profile owner will be cleared by this method, it is
     * a best-effort process and some other policies will still remain in place after the profile
     * owner is cleared.
     *
     * @param admin The component to remove as the profile owner.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not an active profile owner, or the method is
     * being called from a managed profile.
     *
     * @deprecated This method is expected to be used for testing purposes only. The profile owner
     * will lose control of the user and its data after calling it. In order to protect any
     * sensitive data that remains on this user, it is advised that the profile owner deletes it
     * instead of calling this method. See {@link #wipeData(int)}.
