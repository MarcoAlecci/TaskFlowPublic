     * given wait timeout. To detect a sequence of events one can implement a
     * filter that keeps track of seen events of the expected sequence and
     * returns true after the last event of that sequence is received.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> It is caller's responsibility to recycle the returned event.
     * </p>
