     * Enable/disable the SO_REUSEADDR socket option.
     * <p>
     * For UDP sockets it may be necessary to bind more than one
     * socket to the same socket address. This is typically for the
     * purpose of receiving multicast packets
     * (See {@link java.net.MulticastSocket}). The
     * {@code SO_REUSEADDR} socket option allows multiple
     * sockets to be bound to the same socket address if the
     * {@code SO_REUSEADDR} socket option is enabled prior
     * to binding the socket using {@link #bind(SocketAddress)}.
     * <p>
     * Note: This functionality is not supported by all existing platforms,
     * so it is implementation specific whether this option will be ignored
     * or not. However, if it is not supported then
     * {@link #getReuseAddress()} will always return {@code false}.
     * <p>
     * When a {@code DatagramSocket} is created the initial setting
     * of {@code SO_REUSEADDR} is disabled.
     * <p>
     * The behaviour when {@code SO_REUSEADDR} is enabled or
     * disabled after a socket is bound (See {@link #isBound()})
     * is not defined.
     *

     *            disabling the {@code SO_RESUEADDR} socket option,
     *            or the socket is closed.
