     * Requests pointer capture mode.
     * <p>
     * When the window has pointer capture, the mouse pointer icon will disappear and will not
     * change its position. Further mouse will be dispatched with the source
     * {@link InputDevice#SOURCE_MOUSE_RELATIVE}, and relative position changes will be available
     * through {@link MotionEvent#getX} and {@link MotionEvent#getY}. Non-mouse events
     * (touchscreens, or stylus) will not be affected.
     * <p>
     * If the window already has pointer capture, this call does nothing.
     * <p>
     * The capture may be released through {@link #releasePointerCapture()}, or will be lost
     * automatically when the window loses focus.
