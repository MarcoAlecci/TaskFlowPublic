     * Execute the given SQL statement on all connections to this database.
     * <p>
     * This statement will be immediately executed on all existing connections,
     * and will be automatically executed on all future connections.
     * <p>
     * Some example usages are changes like {@code PRAGMA trusted_schema=OFF} or
     * functions like {@code SELECT icu_load_collation()}. If you execute these
     * statements using {@link #execSQL} then they will only apply to a single
     * database connection; using this method will ensure that they are
     * uniformly applied to all current and future connections.
     *
     * @param sql The SQL statement to be executed. Multiple statements
     *            separated by semicolons are not supported.
     * @param bindArgs The arguments that should be bound to the SQL statement.
