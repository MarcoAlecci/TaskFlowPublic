     * Aggregate process states to reduce size of statistics logs.
     *
     * <p>Involves unpacking the three parts of state (process state / device memory state /
     * screen state), manipulating the elements, then re-packing the new values into a single
     * int. This integer is guaranteed to be unique for any given combination of state elements.
     *
     * @param curState current state as used in mCurState in {@class ProcessState} ie. a value
     *                 combined from the process's state, the device's memory pressure state, and
     *                 the device's screen on/off state.
     * @return an integer representing the combination of screen state and process state, where
     *         process state has been aggregated.
