     * Remove permissions to access a particular content provider Uri
     * that were previously added with {@link #grantUriPermission} for a specific target
     * package.  The given Uri will match all previously granted Uris that are the same or a
     * sub-path of the given Uri.  That is, revoking "content://foo/target" will
     * revoke both "content://foo/target" and "content://foo/target/sub", but not
     * "content://foo".  It will not remove any prefix grants that exist at a
     * higher level.
     *
     * <p>Unlike {@link #revokeUriPermission(Uri, int)}, this method will <em>only</em>
     * revoke permissions that had been explicitly granted through {@link #grantUriPermission}
     * and only for the package specified.  Any matching grants that have happened through
     * other mechanisms (clipboard, activity launching, service starting, etc) will not be
     * removed.</p>
