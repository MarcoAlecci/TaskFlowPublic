     * Sets whether the View's Outline should be used to clip the contents of the View.
     * <p>
     * Only a single non-rectangular clip can be applied on a View at any time.
     * Circular clips from a {@link ViewAnimationUtils#createCircularReveal(View, int, int, float, float)
     * circular reveal} animation take priority over Outline clipping, and
     * child Outline clipping takes priority over Outline clipping done by a
     * parent.
     * <p>
     * Note that this flag will only be respected if the View's Outline returns true from
     * {@link Outline#canClip()}.
