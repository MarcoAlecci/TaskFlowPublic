     * This constructor will try to take a string like
     * "Foo Bar (something) &lt;foo\@google.com&gt;,
     * blah\@google.com (something)"
     * and convert it into one or more Rfc822Tokens, output into the supplied
     * collection.
     *
     * It does *not* decode MIME encoded-words; charset conversion
     * must already have taken place if necessary.
     * It will try to be tolerant of broken syntax instead of
     * returning an error.
     *
