     * Unregister a service registered through {@link #registerService}. A successful
     * unregister is notified to the application with a call to
     * {@link RegistrationListener#onServiceUnregistered}.
     *
     * @param listener This should be the listener object that was passed to
     * {@link #registerService}. It identifies the service that should be unregistered
     * and notifies of a successful or unsuccessful unregistration via the listener
     * callbacks.  In API versions 20 and above, the listener object may be used for
     * another service registration once the callback has been called.  In API versions <= 19,
     * there is no entirely reliable way to know when a listener may be re-used, and a new
     * listener should be created for each service registration request.
