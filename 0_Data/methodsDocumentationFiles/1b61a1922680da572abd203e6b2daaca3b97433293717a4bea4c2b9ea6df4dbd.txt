     * Determines if the {@link Conference} is considered "multiparty" or not.  By default all
     * conferences are considered multiparty.  A multiparty conference is one where there are
     * multiple conference participants (other than the host) in the conference.
     * This is tied to {@link #setConferenceState(boolean)}, which is used for some use cases to
     * have a conference appear as if it is a standalone call, in which case the conference will
     * no longer be multiparty.
     * @return {@code true} if conference is treated as a conference (i.e. it is multiparty),
     * {@code false} if it should emulate a standalone call (i.e. not multiparty).
