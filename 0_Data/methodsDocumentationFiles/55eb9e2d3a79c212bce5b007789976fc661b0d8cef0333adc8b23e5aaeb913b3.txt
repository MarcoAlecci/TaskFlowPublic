     * Generic method for retrieving vendor-specific parameter values.
     * The framework does not interpret the parameters, they are passed
     * in an opaque manner between a vendor application and HAL.
     *
     * Framework does not cache set/get requests, so it's possible for
     * getParameter to return a different value than previous setParameter call.
     *
     * The syntax and semantics of keys are up to the vendor (as long as prefix
     * rules are obeyed). For instance, vendors may include some form of
     * wildcard support. In such case, result vector may be of different size
     * than requested keys vector. However, wildcards are not recognized by
     * framework and they are passed as-is to the HAL implementation.
     *
     * Unknown keys must be ignored and not placed into results vector.
     *
     * @param keys Parameter keys to fetch.
     * @return Vendor-specific key-value pairs.
