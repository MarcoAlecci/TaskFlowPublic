     * Register the callback to be notified when the state of a hardware geofence
     * monitoring system changes. For instance, it can change from
     * {@link #MONITOR_CURRENTLY_AVAILABLE} to {@link #MONITOR_CURRENTLY_UNAVAILABLE}
     *
     * <p> Requires {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} permission when
     * {@link #MONITORING_TYPE_GPS_HARDWARE} is used.
     *
     * <p> Requires {@link android.Manifest.permission#LOCATION_HARDWARE} permission to access
     * geofencing in hardware.
     *
     * <p>This API should not be called directly by the app developers. A higher level api
     * which abstracts the hardware should be used instead. All the checks are done by the higher
     * level public API. Any needed locking should be handled by the higher level API.
     *
     * <p> The same callback object can be used to be informed of geofence transitions
     * and state changes of the underlying hardware subsystem.
     *
     * @param monitoringType Type of the monitor
     * @param callback Callback that will be called.
     * @return true on success
