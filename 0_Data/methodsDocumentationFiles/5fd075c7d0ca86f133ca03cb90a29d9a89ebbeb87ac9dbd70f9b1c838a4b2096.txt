     * Return true if the fragment has been hidden.  By default fragments
     * are shown.  You can find out about changes to this state with
     * {@link #onHiddenChanged}.  Note that the hidden state is orthogonal
     * to other states -- that is, to be visible to the user, a fragment
     * must be both started and not hidden.
