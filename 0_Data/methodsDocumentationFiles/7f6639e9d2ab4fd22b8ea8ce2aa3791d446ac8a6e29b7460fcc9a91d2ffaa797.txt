     * Apply this matrix to the src rectangle, and write the transformed rectangle into dst. This is
     * accomplished by transforming the 4 corners of src, and then setting dst to the bounds of
     * those points.
     *
     * @param dst Where the transformed rectangle is written.
     * @param src The original rectangle to be transformed.
     * @return the result of calling rectStaysRect()
