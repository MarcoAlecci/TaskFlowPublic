     * Samples the gesture spatially by rendering the gesture into a 2D 
     * grayscale bitmap. Scales the gesture to fit the size of the bitmap. 
     * 
     * @param gesture the gesture to be sampled
     * @param bitmapSize the size of the bitmap
     * @param keepAspectRatio if the scaling should keep the gesture's 
     *        aspect ratio
     * 
     * @return a bitmapSize x bitmapSize grayscale bitmap that is represented 
     *         as a 1D array. The float at index i represents the grayscale 
     *         value at pixel [i%bitmapSize, i/bitmapSize]
