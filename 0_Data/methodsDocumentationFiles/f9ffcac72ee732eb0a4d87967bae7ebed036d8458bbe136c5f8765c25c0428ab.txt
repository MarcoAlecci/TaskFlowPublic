     * @hide
     * @param discardBuffer determines whether the surface will attempt to preserve its contents
     *                      between frames.  If set to true the renderer will attempt to preserve
     *                      the contents of the buffer between frames if the implementation allows
     *                      it.  If set to false no attempt will be made to preserve the buffer's
     *                      contents between frames.
