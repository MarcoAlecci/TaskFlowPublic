         * Returns the total cumulative duration that this timer has been on since reset().
         * If mTimerPool == null, this should be the same
         * as getTotalTimeLocked(elapsedRealtimeMs*1000, STATS_SINCE_CHARGED)/1000.
         *
         * Note that this time is NOT split between the timers in the timer group that
         * this timer is attached to.  It is the TOTAL time. For this reason, if mTimerPool != null,
         * the result will not be equivalent to getTotalTimeLocked.
