     * This method tries its best to return a valid {@link Locale} object from the TTS-specific
     * Locale input (returned by {@link TextToSpeech#getLanguage}
     * and {@link TextToSpeech#getDefaultLanguage}). A TTS Locale language field contains
     * a three-letter ISO 639-2/T code (where a proper Locale would use a two-letter ISO 639-1
     * code), and the country field contains a three-letter ISO 3166 country code (where a proper
     * Locale would use a two-letter ISO 3166-1 code).
     *
     * This method tries to convert three-letter language and country codes into their two-letter
     * equivalents. If it fails to do so, it keeps the value from the TTS locale.
