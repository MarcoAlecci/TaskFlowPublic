         * The default state is {@code false}: that is, the for the job to be runnable even when
         * someone is interacting with the device.
         *
         * <p>This state is a loose definition provided by the system. In general, it means that
         * the device is not currently being used interactively, and has not been in use for some
         * time. As such, it is a good time to perform resource heavy jobs. Bear in mind that
         * battery usage will still be attributed to your application, and surfaced to the user in
         * battery stats.</p>

         * <p class="note">Despite the similar naming, this job constraint is <em>not</em>
         * related to the system's "device idle" or "doze" states.  This constraint only
         * determines whether a job is allowed to run while the device is directly in use.

         * @param requiresDeviceIdle Pass {@code true} to prevent the job from running
         *     while the device is being used interactively.
