     * Control whether the EGL context is preserved when the GLSurfaceView is paused and
     * resumed.
     * <p>
     * If set to true, then the EGL context may be preserved when the GLSurfaceView is paused.
     * <p>
     * Prior to API level 11, whether the EGL context is actually preserved or not
     * depends upon whether the Android device can support an arbitrary number of
     * EGL contexts or not. Devices that can only support a limited number of EGL
     * contexts must release the EGL context in order to allow multiple applications
     * to share the GPU.
     * <p>
     * If set to false, the EGL context will be released when the GLSurfaceView is paused,
     * and recreated when the GLSurfaceView is resumed.
     * <p>
     *
     * The default is false.
