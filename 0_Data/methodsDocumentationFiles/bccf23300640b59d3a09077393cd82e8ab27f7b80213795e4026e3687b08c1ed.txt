     * Set the timestamp associated with this frame.
     * <p>
     * The timestamp is measured in nanoseconds, and is normally monotonically
     * increasing. The timestamps for the images from different sources may have
     * different timebases therefore may not be comparable. The specific meaning and
     * timebase of the timestamp depend on the source providing images. See
     * {@link android.hardware.Camera Camera},
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice CameraDevice},
     * {@link MediaPlayer} and {@link MediaCodec} for more details.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For images dequeued from {@link ImageWriter} via
     * {@link ImageWriter#dequeueInputImage()}, it's up to the application to
     * set the timestamps correctly before sending them back to the
     * {@link ImageWriter}, or the timestamp will be generated automatically when
     * {@link ImageWriter#queueInputImage queueInputImage()} is called.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param timestamp The timestamp to be set for this image.
