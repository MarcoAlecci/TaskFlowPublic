     * Terminates this instance. Also terminates
     * any streaming services spawned from this instance as if
     * {@link StreamingService#close()} had been called on them. After this method returns,
     * no further callbacks originating from the middleware will be enqueued on the provided
     * instance of {@link MbmsStreamingSessionCallback}, but callbacks that have already been
     * enqueued will still be delivered.
     *
     * It is safe to call {@link #create(Context, Executor, int, MbmsStreamingSessionCallback)} to
     * obtain another instance of {@link MbmsStreamingSession} immediately after this method
     * returns.
     *
     * May throw an {@link IllegalStateException}
