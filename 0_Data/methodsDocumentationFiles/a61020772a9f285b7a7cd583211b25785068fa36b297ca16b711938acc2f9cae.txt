     * Sets the Transition that will be used for shared elements transferred back to a
     * calling Activity. Typical Transitions will affect size and location, such as
     * {@link android.transition.ChangeBounds}. A null
     * value will cause transferred shared elements to blink to the final position.
     * If no value is set, the default will be to use the same value as
     * {@link #setSharedElementEnterTransition(android.transition.Transition)}.
     * Requires {@link #FEATURE_ACTIVITY_TRANSITIONS}.
