         * resolve layout parameters that are relative to the layout direction.
         * <p>
         * After this method is called, any rules using layout-relative verbs
         * (ex. {@link #START_OF}) previously added via {@link #addRule(int)}
         * may only be accessed via their resolved absolute verbs (ex.
         * {@link #LEFT_OF}).
