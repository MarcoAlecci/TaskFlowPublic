     * Adopt the permission identity of the shell UID for all permissions. This allows
     * you to call APIs protected permissions which normal apps cannot hold but are
     * granted to the shell UID. If you already adopted all shell permissions by calling
     * this method or {@link #adoptShellPermissionIdentity(String...)} a subsequent call
     * would be a no-op. Note that your permission state becomes that of the shell UID
     * and it is not a combination of your and the shell UID permissions.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:<strong/> Calling this method adopts all shell permissions and overrides
     * any subset of adopted permissions via {@link #adoptShellPermissionIdentity(String...)}.
