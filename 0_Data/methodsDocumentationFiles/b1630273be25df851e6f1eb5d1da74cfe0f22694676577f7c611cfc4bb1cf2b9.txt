     * Returns the top left coordinates of the magnifier source (i.e. the view region going to
     * be magnified and copied to the magnifier), relative to the window or surface the content
     * is copied from. The content will be copied:
     * - if the magnified view is a {@link SurfaceView}, from the surface backing it
     * - otherwise, from the surface backing the main application window, and the coordinates
     *   returned will be relative to the main application window
     * The method will return {@code null} if #show has not yet been called, or if the last
     * operation performed was a #dismiss.
