     * Removes a previously registered list of AIDs for the specified category for the
     * service provided.
     *
     * <p>Note that this will only remove AIDs that were dynamically
     * registered using the {@link #registerAidsForService(ComponentName, String, List)}
     * method. It will *not* remove AIDs that were statically registered in
     * the manifest. If dynamically registered AIDs are removed using
     * this method, and a statically registered AID group for the same category
     * exists in the manifest, the static AID group will become active again.
     *
     * @param service The component name of the service
     * @param category The category of the AIDs to be removed, e.g. {@link #CATEGORY_PAYMENT}
     * @return whether the group was successfully removed.
