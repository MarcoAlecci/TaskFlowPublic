     * Performs a strict and comprehensive check of whether a calling package is allowed to
     * change the state of network, as the condition differs for pre-M, M+, and
     * privileged/preinstalled apps. The caller is expected to have either the
     * CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE or the WRITE_SETTINGS permission declared. Either of these
     * permissions allow changing network state; WRITE_SETTINGS is a runtime permission and
     * can be revoked, but (except in M, excluding M MRs), CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE is a normal
     * permission and cannot be revoked. See http://b/23597341
     *
     * Note: if the check succeeds because the application holds WRITE_SETTINGS, the operation
     * of this app will be updated to the current time.
