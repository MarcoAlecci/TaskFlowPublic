     * Requests the system does not modify the currently installed time zone distro, if any. This
     * method records the fact that a time zone check operation triggered by the system is now
     * complete and there was nothing to do. The token passed should be the one presented when the
     * check was triggered.
     *
     * <p>Note: Passing {@code success == false} may result in more checks being triggered. Clients
     * should be careful not to pass false if the failure is unlikely to resolve by itself.
     *
     * @param checkToken an optional token provided if the install was triggered in response to a
     *     {@link RulesUpdaterContract#ACTION_TRIGGER_RULES_UPDATE_CHECK} intent
     * @param succeeded true if the check was successful, false if it was not successful but may
     *     succeed if it is retried
