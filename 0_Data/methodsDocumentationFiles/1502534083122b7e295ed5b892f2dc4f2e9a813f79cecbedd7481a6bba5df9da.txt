     * Internal utility method for checking whether a given view/id
     * is valid for this transition, where "valid" means that either
     * the Transition has no target/targetId list (the default, in which
     * cause the transition should act on all views in the hiearchy), or
     * the given view is in the target list or the view id is in the
     * targetId list. If the target parameter is null, then the target list
     * is not checked (this is in the case of ListView items, where the
     * views are ignored and only the ids are used).
