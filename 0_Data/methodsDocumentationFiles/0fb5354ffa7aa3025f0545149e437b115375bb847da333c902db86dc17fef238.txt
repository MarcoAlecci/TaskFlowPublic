         * Defines the maximum velocity ItemTouchHelper will ever calculate for pointer movements.
         * <p>
         * To consider a movement as swipe, ItemTouchHelper requires it to be larger than the
         * perpendicular movement. If both directions reach to the max threshold, none of them will
         * be considered as a swipe because it is usually an indication that user rather tried to
         * scroll then swipe.
         * <p>
         * The velocity is calculated in pixels per second.
         * <p>
         * You can customize this behavior by changing this method. If you increase the value, it
         * will be easier for the user to swipe diagonally and if you decrease the value, user will
         * need to make a rather straight finger movement to trigger a swipe.
         *
         * @param defaultValue The default value(in pixels per second) used by the ItemTouchHelper.
         * @return The velocity cap for pointer movements. The default implementation returns the
         * <code>defaultValue</code> parameter.
