         * If your job doesn't need a network connection, you don't need to call
         * this method, as the default is {@code null}.
         * <p>
         * Calling this method defines network as a strict requirement for your
         * job. If the network requested is not available your job will never
         * run. See {@link #setOverrideDeadline(long)} to change this behavior.
         * Calling this method will override any requirements previously defined
         * by {@link #setRequiredNetworkType(int)}; you typically only want to
         * call one of these methods.
         * <p class="note">
         * When your job executes in
         * {@link JobService#onStartJob(JobParameters)}, be sure to use the
         * specific network returned by {@link JobParameters#getNetwork()},
         * otherwise you'll use the default network which may not meet this
         * constraint.
