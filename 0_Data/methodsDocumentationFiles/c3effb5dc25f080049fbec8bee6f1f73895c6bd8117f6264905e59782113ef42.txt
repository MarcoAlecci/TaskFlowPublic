     * Computes a SHA256 digest of the signatures' SHA256 digests. First,
     * individual hashes for each signature is derived in a hexademical
     * form, then these strings are sorted based the natural ordering, and
     * finally a hash is derived from these strings' bytes.
     * @param signatures The signatures.
     * @return The digest.
