     * Sets the audio sampling rate for recording. Call this method before prepare().
     * Prepare() may perform additional checks on the parameter to make sure whether
     * the specified audio sampling rate is applicable. The sampling rate really depends
     * on the format for the audio recording, as well as the capabilities of the platform.
     * For instance, the sampling rate supported by AAC audio coding standard ranges
     * from 8 to 96 kHz, the sampling rate supported by AMRNB is 8kHz, and the sampling
     * rate supported by AMRWB is 16kHz. Please consult with the related audio coding
     * standard for the supported audio sampling rate.
     *
     * @param samplingRate the sampling rate for audio in samples per second.
