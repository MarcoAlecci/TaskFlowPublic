     * Get a sort key that orders this notification among other notifications from the
     * same package. This can be useful if an external sort was already applied and an app
     * would like to preserve this. Notifications will be sorted lexicographically using this
     * value, although providing different priorities in addition to providing sort key may
     * cause this value to be ignored.
     *
     * <p>This sort key can also be used to order members of a notification group. See
     * {@link Builder#setGroup}.
