     * Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the
     * current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call
     * this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and
     * therefore you can skip making the draw calls).
     *
     * @param left        The left side of the rectangle to compare with the
     *                    current clip
     * @param top         The top of the rectangle to compare with the current
     *                    clip
     * @param right       The right side of the rectangle to compare with the
     *                    current clip
     * @param bottom      The bottom of the rectangle to compare with the
     *                    current clip
     * @param type        {@link Canvas.EdgeType#AA} if the path should be considered antialiased,
     *                    since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than
     *                    non-antialiased ({@link Canvas.EdgeType#BW}).
     * @return            true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix)
     *                    does not intersect with the canvas' clip
     * @deprecated The EdgeType is ignored. Use {@link #quickReject(float, float, float, float)}
     *             instead.
