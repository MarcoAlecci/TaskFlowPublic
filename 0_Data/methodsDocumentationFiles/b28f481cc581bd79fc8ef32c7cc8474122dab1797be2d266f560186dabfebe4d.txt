     * Returns the set of physical camera ids that this logical {@link CameraDevice} is
     * made up of.
     *
     * <p>A camera device is a logical camera if it has
     * REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA capability. If the camera device
     * doesn't have the capability, the return value will be an empty set. </p>
     *
     * <p>Prior to API level 29, all returned IDs are guaranteed to be returned by {@link
     * CameraManager#getCameraIdList}, and can be opened directly by
     * {@link CameraManager#openCamera}. Starting from API level 29, for each of the returned ID,
     * if it's also returned by {@link CameraManager#getCameraIdList}, it can be used as a
     * standalone camera by {@link CameraManager#openCamera}. Otherwise, the camera ID can only be
     * used as part of the current logical camera.</p>
     *
     * <p>The set returned is not modifiable, so any attempts to modify it will throw
     * a {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.</p>
     *
     * @return Set of physical camera ids for this logical camera device.
