     * Sets the {@link android.text.method.MovementMethod} for handling arrow key movement
     * for this TextView. This can be null to disallow using the arrow keys to move the
     * cursor or scroll the view.
     * <p>
     * Be warned that if you want a TextView with a key listener or movement
     * method not to be focusable, or if you want a TextView without a
     * key listener or movement method to be focusable, you must call
     * {@link #setFocusable} again after calling this to get the focusability
     * back the way you want it.
