     * Set an event listener to receive notifications from the MediaCas instance.
     *
     * @param listener the event listener to be set.
     * @param handler the handler whose looper the event listener will be called on.
     * If handler is null, we'll try to use current thread's looper, or the main
     * looper. If neither are available, an internal thread will be created instead.
