         * <p>Each TV input service is required to query the system whether the user is allowed to
         * watch the current program before showing it to the user if the parental controls is
         * enabled (i.e. {@link TvInputManager#isParentalControlsEnabled
         * TvInputManager.isParentalControlsEnabled()} returns {@code true}). Whether the TV input
         * service should block the content or not is determined by invoking
         * {@link TvInputManager#isRatingBlocked TvInputManager.isRatingBlocked(TvContentRating)}
         * with the content rating for the current program. Then the {@link TvInputManager} makes a
         * judgment based on the user blocked ratings stored in the secure settings and returns the
         * result. If the rating in question turns out to be allowed by the user, the TV input
         * service must call this method to notify the application that is permitted to show the
         * content.
         *
         * <p>Each TV input service also needs to continuously listen to any changes made to the
         * parental controls settings by registering a broadcast receiver to receive
         * {@link TvInputManager#ACTION_BLOCKED_RATINGS_CHANGED} and
         * {@link TvInputManager#ACTION_PARENTAL_CONTROLS_ENABLED_CHANGED} and immediately
         * reevaluate the current program with the new parental controls settings.
