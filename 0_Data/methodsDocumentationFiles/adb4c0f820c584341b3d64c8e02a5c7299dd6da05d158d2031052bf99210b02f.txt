     *
     * <p> If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then at a
     * single point during a decoding operation this method may start returning
     * <tt>true</tt> to indicate that a specific charset has been detected in
     * the input byte sequence.  Once this occurs, the {@link #detectedCharset
     * detectedCharset} method may be invoked to retrieve the detected charset.
     *
     * <p> That this method returns <tt>false</tt> does not imply that no bytes
     * have yet been decoded.  Some auto-detecting decoders are capable of
     * decoding some, or even all, of an input byte sequence without fixing on
     * a particular charset.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method always throws an {@link
     * UnsupportedOperationException}; it should be overridden by
     * auto-detecting decoders to return <tt>true</tt> once the input charset
     * has been determined.  </p>
