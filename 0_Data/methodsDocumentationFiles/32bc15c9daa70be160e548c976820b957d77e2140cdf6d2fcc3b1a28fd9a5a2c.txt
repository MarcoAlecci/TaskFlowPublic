     * Checks whether the IPC you are handling or your app has a given permission
     * and whether the app op that corresponds to this permission is allowed.
     *
     * <strong>NOTE:</strong> Use this method only for permission checks at the
     * point where you will deliver the permission protected data to clients.
     *
     * <p>For example, if an app registers a location listener it should have the location
     * permission but no data is actually sent to the app at the moment of registration
     * and you should use {@link #checkCallingOrSelfPermissionForPreflight(Context, String)}
     * to determine if the app has or may have location permission (if app has only foreground
     * location the grant state depends on the app's fg/gb state) and this check will not
     * leave a trace that permission protected data was delivered. When you are about to
     * deliver the location data to a registered listener you should use this method which
     * will evaluate the permission access based on the current fg/bg state of the app and
     * leave a record that the data was accessed.
     *
