     * Returns the top left coordinates of the magnifier, relative to the main application
     * window. They will be determined by the coordinates of the last {@link #show(float, float)}
     * or {@link #show(float, float, float, float)} call, adjusted to take into account any
     * potential clamping behavior. The method can be used immediately after a #show
     * call to find out where the magnifier will be positioned. However, the position of the
     * magnifier will not be updated visually in the same frame, due to the async nature of
     * the content copying and of the magnifier rendering.
     * The method will return {@code null} if #show has not yet been called, or if the last
     * operation performed was a #dismiss.
