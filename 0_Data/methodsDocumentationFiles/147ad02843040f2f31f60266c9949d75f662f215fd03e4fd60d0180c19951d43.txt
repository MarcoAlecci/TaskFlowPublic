     * Create a Bluetooth L2CAP Connection-oriented Channel (CoC) {@link BluetoothSocket} that can
     * be used to start a secure outgoing connection to the remote device with the same dynamic
     * protocol/service multiplexer (PSM) value. The supported Bluetooth transport is LE only.
     * <p>This is designed to be used with {@link
     * BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingInsecureL2capChannel()} for peer-peer Bluetooth applications.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothSocket#connect} to initiate the outgoing connection.
     * <p>Application using this API is responsible for obtaining PSM value from remote device.
     * <p> The communication channel may not have an authenticated link key, i.e. it may be subject
     * to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use {@link #createL2capChannel(int)} if an encrypted and
     * authenticated communication channel is possible.

     * @throws IOException on error, for example Bluetooth not available, or insufficient
     * permissions
