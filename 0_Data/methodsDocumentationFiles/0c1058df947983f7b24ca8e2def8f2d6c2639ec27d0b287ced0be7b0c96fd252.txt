     * Get a predefined vibration effect associated with a given URI.
     *
     * Predefined effects are a set of common vibration effects that should be identical, regardless
     * of the app they come from, in order to provide a cohesive experience for users across
     * the entire device. They also may be custom tailored to the device hardware in order to
     * provide a better experience than you could otherwise build using the generic building
     * blocks.
     *
     * @param uri The URI associated with the haptic effect.
     * @param context The context used to get the URI to haptic effect association.
     *
     * @return The desired effect, or {@code null} if there's no associated effect.
