     * Creates a server mode {@link Socket} layered over an
     * existing connected socket, and is able to read data which has
     * already been consumed/removed from the {@link Socket}'s
     * underlying {@link InputStream}.
     * <p>
     * This method can be used by a server application that needs to
     * observe the inbound data but still create valid SSL/TLS
     * connections: for example, inspection of Server Name Indication
     * (SNI) extensions (See section 3 of <A
     * HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6066.txt">TLS Extensions
     * (RFC6066)</A>).  Data that has been already removed from the
     * underlying {@link InputStream} should be loaded into the
     * {@code consumed} stream before this method is called, perhaps
     * using a {@link java.io.ByteArrayInputStream}.  When this
     * {@link Socket} begins handshaking, it will read all of the data in
     * {@code consumed} until it reaches {@code EOF}, then all further
     * data is read from the underlying {@link InputStream} as
     * usual.
     * <p>
     * The returned socket is configured using the socket options
     * established for this factory, and is set to use server mode when
     * handshaking (see {@link SSLSocket#setUseClientMode(boolean)}).

     *         the consumed inbound network data that has already been
     *         removed from the existing {@link Socket}
     *         {@link InputStream}.  This parameter may be
     *         {@code null} if no data has been removed.
     * @param  autoClose close the underlying socket when this socket is closed.
