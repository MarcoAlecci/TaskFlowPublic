     * If a particular process and user ID has not been granted
     * permission to access a specific URI, throw {@link
     * SecurityException}.  This only checks for permissions that have
     * been explicitly granted -- if the given process/uid has more
     * general access to the URI's content provider then this check
     * will always fail.
     *
     * @param uri The uri that is being checked.
     * @param pid The process ID being checked against.  Must be &gt; 0.
     * @param uid The user ID being checked against.  A uid of 0 is the root
     * user, which will pass every permission check.
     * @param modeFlags The access modes to enforce.
     * @param message A message to include in the exception if it is thrown.
