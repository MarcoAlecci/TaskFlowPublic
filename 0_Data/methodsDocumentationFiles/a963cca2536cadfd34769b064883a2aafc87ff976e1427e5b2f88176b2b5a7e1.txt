     * Decodes a string field that's formatted like the EF[ADN] alpha
     * identifier
     *
     * From TS 51.011 10.5.1:
     *   Coding:
     *       this alpha tagging shall use either
     *      -    the SMS default 7 bit coded alphabet as defined in
     *          TS 23.038 [12] with bit 8 set to 0. The alpha identifier
     *          shall be left justified. Unused bytes shall be set to 'FF'; or
     *      -    one of the UCS2 coded options as defined in annex B.
     *
     * Annex B from TS 11.11 V8.13.0:
     *      1)  If the first octet in the alpha string is '80', then the
     *          remaining octets are 16 bit UCS2 characters ...
     *      2)  if the first octet in the alpha string is '81', then the
     *          second octet contains a value indicating the number of
     *          characters in the string, and the third octet contains an
     *          8 bit number which defines bits 15 to 8 of a 16 bit
     *          base pointer, where bit 16 is set to zero and bits 7 to 1
     *          are also set to zero.  These sixteen bits constitute a
     *          base pointer to a "half page" in the UCS2 code space, to be
     *          used with some or all of the remaining octets in the string.
     *          The fourth and subsequent octets contain codings as follows:
     *          If bit 8 of the octet is set to zero, the remaining 7 bits
     *          of the octet contain a GSM Default Alphabet character,
     *          whereas if bit 8 of the octet is set to one, then the
     *          remaining seven bits are an offset value added to the
     *          16 bit base pointer defined earlier...
     *      3)  If the first octet of the alpha string is set to '82', then
     *          the second octet contains a value indicating the number of
     *          characters in the string, and the third and fourth octets
     *          contain a 16 bit number which defines the complete 16 bit
     *          base pointer to a "half page" in the UCS2 code space...
