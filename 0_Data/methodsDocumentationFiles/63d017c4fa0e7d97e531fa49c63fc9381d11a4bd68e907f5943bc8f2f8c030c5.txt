     * Returns {@code true} if {@code x} is a {@code BigDecimal} instance and if
     * this instance is equal to this big decimal. Two big decimals are equal if
     * their unscaled value and their scale is equal. For example, 1.0
     * (10*10<sup>-1</sup>) is not equal to 1.00 (100*10<sup>-2</sup>). Similarly, zero
     * instances are not equal if their scale differs.
