     * Called to open a {@link MidiInputPort} for the specified port number.
     *
     * An input port can only be used by one sender at a time.
     * Opening an input port will fail if another application has already opened it for use.
     * A {@link MidiDeviceStatus} can be used to determine if an input port is already open.
     *
     * @param portNumber the number of the input port to open
     * @return the {@link MidiInputPort} if the open is successful,
     *         or null in case of failure.
