     *
     * <p> The returned {@code Set} is backed by this Subject's
     * internal private Credential {@code Set}.  Any modification
     * to the returned {@code Set} affects the internal private
     * Credential {@code Set} as well.
     *
     * <p> A caller requires permissions to access the Credentials
     * in the returned {@code Set}, or to modify the
     * {@code Set} itself.  A {@code SecurityException}
     * is thrown if the caller does not have the proper permissions.
     *
     * <p> While iterating through the {@code Set},
     * a {@code SecurityException} is thrown
     * if the caller does not have permission to access a
     * particular Credential.  The {@code Iterator}
     * is nevertheless advanced to next element in the {@code Set}.
