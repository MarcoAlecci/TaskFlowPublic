     * Computes the differences in WorkChains contained between {@code oldWs} and {@code newWs}.
     *
     * Returns {@code null} if no differences exist, otherwise returns a two element array. The
     * first element is a list of "new" chains, i.e WorkChains present in {@code newWs} but not in
     * {@code oldWs}. The second element is a list of "gone" chains, i.e WorkChains present in
     * {@code oldWs} but not in {@code newWs}.
