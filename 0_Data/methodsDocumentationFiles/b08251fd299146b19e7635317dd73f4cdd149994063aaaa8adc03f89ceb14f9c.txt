     * Gets the current notification interruption filter active on the host.
     *
     * <p>
     * The interruption filter defines which notifications are allowed to interrupt the user
     * (e.g. via sound &amp; vibration) and is applied globally. Listeners can find out whether
     * a specific notification matched the interruption filter via
     * {@link Ranking#matchesInterruptionFilter()}.
     * <p>
     * The current filter may differ from the previously requested filter if the notification host
     * does not support or refuses to apply the requested filter, or if another component changed
     * the filter in the meantime.
     * <p>
     * Listen for updates using {@link #onInterruptionFilterChanged(int)}.
     *
     * <p>The service should wait for the {@link #onListenerConnected()} event
     * before performing this operation.
     *
     * @return One of the INTERRUPTION_FILTER_ constants, or INTERRUPTION_FILTER_UNKNOWN when
     * unavailable.
