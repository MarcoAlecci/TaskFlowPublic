     * @return true if this subtype is auxiliary, false otherwise. An auxiliary subtype will not be
     * shown in the list of enabled IMEs for choosing the current IME in the Settings even when this
     * subtype is enabled. Please note that this subtype will still be shown in the list of IMEs in
     * the IME switcher to allow the user to tentatively switch to this subtype while an IME is
     * shown. The framework will never switch the current IME to this subtype by
     * {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager#switchToLastInputMethod}.
     * The intent of having this flag is to allow for IMEs that are invoked in a one-shot way as
     * auxiliary input mode, and return to the previous IME once it is finished (e.g. voice input).
