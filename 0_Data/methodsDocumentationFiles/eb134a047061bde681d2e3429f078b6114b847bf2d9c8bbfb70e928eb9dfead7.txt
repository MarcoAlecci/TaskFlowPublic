     * Initializes this key agreement with the given key and set of
     * algorithm parameters.
     *
     * <p> If this key agreement requires any random bytes, it will get
     * them using the
     * {@link java.security.SecureRandom}
     * implementation of the highest-priority
     * installed provider as the source of randomness.
     * (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation of
     * SecureRandom, a system-provided source of randomness will be used.)
     *
     * @param key the party's private information. For example, in the case
     * of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, this would be the party's own
     * Diffie-Hellman private key.
     * @param params the key agreement parameters
     *
     * @exception InvalidKeyException if the given key is
     * inappropriate for this key agreement, e.g., is of the wrong type or
     * has an incompatible algorithm type.
     * @exception InvalidAlgorithmParameterException if the given parameters
     * are inappropriate for this key agreement.
