     *  Returns the maximum size of the <code>AudioTrack</code> buffer in frames.
     *  <p> If the track's creation mode is {@link #MODE_STATIC},
     *  it is equal to the specified bufferSizeInBytes on construction, converted to frame units.
     *  A static track's frame count will not change.
     *  <p> If the track's creation mode is {@link #MODE_STREAM},
     *  it is greater than or equal to the specified bufferSizeInBytes converted to frame units.
     *  For streaming tracks, this value may be rounded up to a larger value if needed by
     *  the target output sink, and
     *  if the track is subsequently routed to a different output sink, the
     *  frame count may enlarge to accommodate.
     *  <p> If the <code>AudioTrack</code> encoding indicates compressed data,
     *  e.g. {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_AC3}, then the frame count returned is
     *  the size of the <code>AudioTrack</code> buffer in bytes.
     *  <p> See also {@link AudioManager#getProperty(String)} for key
     *  {@link AudioManager#PROPERTY_OUTPUT_FRAMES_PER_BUFFER}.
     *  @return maximum size in frames of the <code>AudioTrack</code> buffer.
     *  @throws IllegalStateException if track is not initialized.
