     * Explicitly set the storage location used internally by this class to be
     * device-protected storage.
     * <p>
     * On devices with direct boot, data stored in this location is encrypted
     * with a key tied to the physical device, and it can be accessed
     * immediately after the device has booted successfully, both
     * <em>before and after</em> the user has authenticated with their
     * credentials (such as a lock pattern or PIN).
     * <p>
     * Because device-protected data is available without user authentication,
     * you should carefully limit the data you store using this Context. For
     * example, storing sensitive authentication tokens or passwords in the
     * device-protected area is strongly discouraged.
