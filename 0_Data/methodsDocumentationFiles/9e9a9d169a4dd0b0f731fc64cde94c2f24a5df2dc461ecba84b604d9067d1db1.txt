         * Optional: Sets a hint to the system for whether to require user confirmation after
         * authentication. For example, implicit modalities like face and iris are passive, meaning
         * they don't require an explicit user action to complete authentication. If set to true,
         * these modalities should require the user to take some action (e.g. press a button)
         * before {@link AuthenticationCallback#onAuthenticationSucceeded(AuthenticationResult)} is
         * called. Defaults to true.
         *
         * <p>A typical use case for not requiring confirmation would be for low-risk transactions,
         * such as re-authenticating a recently authenticated application. A typical use case for
         * requiring confirmation would be for authorizing a purchase.
         *
         * <p>Note that this just passes a hint to the system, which the system may then ignore. For
         * example, a value of false may be ignored if the user has disabled implicit authentication
         * in Settings, or if it does not apply to a particular modality (e.g. fingerprint).
         *
         * @param requireConfirmation true if explicit user confirmation should be required, or
         *                            false otherwise.
         * @return This builder.
