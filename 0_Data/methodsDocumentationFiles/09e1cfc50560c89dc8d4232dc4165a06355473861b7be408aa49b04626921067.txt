     * Gets the backup directory which may or may not exist. This could be
     * useful if you are writing new state to the directory but need to access
     * the last persisted state at the same time. This means that this call is
     * useful in between {@link #startWrite()} and {@link #finishWrite()} or
     * {@link #failWrite()}. You should not modify the content returned by this
     * method.
