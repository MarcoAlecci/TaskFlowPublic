     * An unique id per face while the face is visible to the tracker.
     *
     * <p>
     * If the face leaves the field-of-view and comes back, it will get a new
     * id.</p>
     *
     * <p>This is an optional field, may not be supported on all devices.
     * If the id is {@value #ID_UNSUPPORTED} then the leftEyePosition, rightEyePosition, and
     * mouthPositions are guaranteed to be {@code null}. Otherwise, each of leftEyePosition,
     * rightEyePosition, and mouthPosition may be independently null or not-null. When devices
     * report the value of key {@link CaptureResult#STATISTICS_FACE_DETECT_MODE} as
     * {@link CameraMetadata#STATISTICS_FACE_DETECT_MODE_SIMPLE} in {@link CaptureResult},
     * the face id of each face is expected to be {@value #ID_UNSUPPORTED}.</p>
     *
     * <p>This value will either be {@value #ID_UNSUPPORTED} or
     * otherwise greater than {@code 0}.</p>
