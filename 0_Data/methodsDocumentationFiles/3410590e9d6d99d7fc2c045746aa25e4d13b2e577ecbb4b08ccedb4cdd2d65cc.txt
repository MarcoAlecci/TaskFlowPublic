     * Called when the database needs to be downgraded. This is strictly similar to
     * {@link #onUpgrade} method, but is called whenever current version is newer than requested one.
     * However, this method is not abstract, so it is not mandatory for a customer to
     * implement it. If not overridden, default implementation will reject downgrade and
     * throws SQLiteException
     *
     * <p>
     * This method executes within a transaction.  If an exception is thrown, all changes
     * will automatically be rolled back.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param db The database.
     * @param oldVersion The old database version.
     * @param newVersion The new database version.
