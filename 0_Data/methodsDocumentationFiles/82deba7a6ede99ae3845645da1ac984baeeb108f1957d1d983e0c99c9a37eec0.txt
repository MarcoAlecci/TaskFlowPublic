     * Default implementation of {@link KeyEvent.Callback#onKeyMultiple(int, int, KeyEvent)
     * KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyMultiple()}: always returns false (doesn't handle
     * the event).
     * <p>Key presses in software keyboards will generally NOT trigger this listener,
     * although some may elect to do so in some situations. Do not rely on this to
     * catch software key presses.
     *
     * @param keyCode     A key code that represents the button pressed, from
     *                    {@link android.view.KeyEvent}.
     * @param repeatCount The number of times the action was made.
     * @param event       The KeyEvent object that defines the button action.
