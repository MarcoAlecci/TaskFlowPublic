     * @return An array of audio encodings (e.g. {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_16BIT},
     * {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_FLOAT}) supported by the audio device.
     * <code>ENCODING_PCM_FLOAT</code> indicates the device supports more
     * than 16 bits of integer precision.  As there is no AudioFormat constant
     * specifically defined for 24-bit PCM, the value <code>ENCODING_PCM_FLOAT</code>
     * indicates that {@link AudioTrack} or {@link AudioRecord} can preserve at least 24 bits of
     * integer precision to that device.
     *
     * @see AudioFormat
     *
     * Note: an empty array indicates that the device supports arbitrary encodings.
