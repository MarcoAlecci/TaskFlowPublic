     * Called when a new client has bound to the input method.  This
     * may be followed by a series of {@link #onStartInput(EditorInfo, boolean)}
     * and {@link #onFinishInput()} calls as the user navigates through its
     * UI.  Upon this call you know that {@link #getCurrentInputBinding}
     * and {@link #getCurrentInputConnection} return valid objects.
