         * @implSpec the default implementation invokes {@link #asPrimitiveArray()}
         * to obtain a long[] array then and copies the elements from that
         * long[] array into the boxed Long[] array.  This is not efficient and
         * it is recommended to invoke {@link #copyInto(Object, int)}.
