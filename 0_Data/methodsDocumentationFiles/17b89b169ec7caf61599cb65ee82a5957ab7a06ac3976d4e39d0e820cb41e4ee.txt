     * Notification that the application's current backup operation causes it to exceed
     * the maximum size permitted by the transport.  The ongoing backup operation is
     * halted and rolled back: any data that had been stored by a previous backup operation
     * is still intact.  Typically the quota-exceeded state will be detected before any data
     * is actually transmitted over the network.
     *
     * <p>The {@code quotaBytes} value is the total data size currently permitted for this
     * application.  If desired, the application can use this as a hint for determining
     * how much data to store.  For example, a messaging application might choose to
     * store only the newest messages, dropping enough older content to stay under
     * the quota.
     *
     * <p class="note">Note that the maximum quota for the application can change over
     * time.  In particular, in the future the quota may grow.  Applications that adapt
     * to the quota when deciding what data to store should be aware of this and implement
     * their data storage mechanisms in a way that can take advantage of additional
     * quota.
     *
     * @param backupDataBytes The amount of data measured while initializing the backup
     *    operation, if the total exceeds the app's alloted quota.  If initial measurement
     *    suggested that the data would fit but then too much data was actually submitted
     *    as part of the operation, then this value is the amount of data that had been
     *    streamed into the transport at the time the quota was reached.
     * @param quotaBytes The maximum data size that the transport currently permits
     *    this application to store as a backup.
