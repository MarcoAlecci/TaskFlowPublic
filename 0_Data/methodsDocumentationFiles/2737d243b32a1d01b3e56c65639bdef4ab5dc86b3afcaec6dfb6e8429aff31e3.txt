     * <p>A call to this method resets this signature object to the state
     * it was in when previously initialized for verification via a
     * call to {@code initVerify(PublicKey)}. That is, the object is
     * reset and available to verify another signature from the identity
     * whose public key was specified in the call to {@code initVerify}.

     *
     * @param signature the signature bytes to be verified.
     * @param offset the offset to start from in the array of bytes.
     * @param length the number of bytes to use, starting at offset.
     *
     * @return true if the signature was verified, false if not.
     *
     * @exception SignatureException if this signature object is not
     * initialized properly, the passed-in signature is improperly
     * encoded or of the wrong type, if this signature algorithm is unable to
     * process the input data provided, etc.
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the {@code signature}
     * byte array is null, or the {@code offset} or {@code length}
     * is less than 0, or the sum of the {@code offset} and
     * {@code length} is greater than the length of the
     * {@code signature} byte array.
