     * Turn on launch mode that is safe to use when forwarding intents received from
     * applications and running in system processes.  This mode uses Activity.startActivityAsCaller
     * instead of the normal Activity.startActivity for launching the activity selected
     * by the user.
     *
     * <p>This mode is set to true by default if the activity is initialized through
     * {@link #onCreate(android.os.Bundle)}.  If a subclass calls one of the other onCreate
     * methods, it is set to false by default.  You must set it before calling one of the
     * more detailed onCreate methods, so that it will be set correctly in the case where
     * there is only one intent to resolve and it is thus started immediately.</p>
