     * Add a surface to this OutputConfiguration.
     *
     * <p> This function can be called before or after {@link
     * CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations}. If it's called after,
     * the application must finalize the capture session with
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession#finalizeOutputConfigurations}. It is possible to call this method
     * after the output configurations have been finalized only in cases of enabled surface sharing
     * see {@link #enableSurfaceSharing}. The modified output configuration must be updated with
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession#updateOutputConfiguration}.</p>
     *
     * <p> If the OutputConfiguration was constructed with a deferred surface by {@link
     * OutputConfiguration#OutputConfiguration(Size, Class)}, the added surface must be obtained
     * from {@link android.view.SurfaceView} by calling {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#getSurface},
     * or from {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture} via
     * {@link android.view.Surface#Surface(android.graphics.SurfaceTexture)}).</p>
     *
     * <p> If the OutputConfiguration was constructed by other constructors, the added
     * surface must be compatible with the existing surface. See {@link #enableSurfaceSharing} for
     * details of compatible surfaces.</p>
     *
     * <p> If the OutputConfiguration already contains a Surface, {@link #enableSurfaceSharing} must
     * be called before calling this function to add a new Surface.</p>
     *
     * @param surface The surface to be added.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the Surface is invalid, the Surface's
     *         dataspace/format doesn't match, or adding the Surface would exceed number of
     *         shared surfaces supported.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the Surface was already added to this OutputConfiguration,
     *         or if the OutputConfiguration is not shared and it already has a surface associated
     *         with it.
