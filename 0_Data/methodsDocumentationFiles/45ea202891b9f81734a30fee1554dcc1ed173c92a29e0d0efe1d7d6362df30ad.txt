     * Sends an event associated with this {@link Conference} with associated event extras to the
     * {@link InCallService}.
     * <p>
     * Connection events are used to communicate point in time information from a
     * {@link ConnectionService} to an {@link InCallService} implementation.  An example of a
     * custom connection event includes notifying the UI when a WIFI call has been handed over to
     * LTE, which the InCall UI might use to inform the user that billing charges may apply.  The
     * Android Telephony framework will send the {@link Connection#EVENT_MERGE_COMPLETE}
     * connection event when a call to {@link Call#mergeConference()} has completed successfully.
     * <p>
     * Events are exposed to {@link InCallService} implementations via
     * {@link Call.Callback#onConnectionEvent(Call, String, Bundle)}.
     * <p>
     * No assumptions should be made as to how an In-Call UI or service will handle these events.
     * The {@link ConnectionService} must assume that the In-Call UI could even chose to ignore
     * some events altogether.
     * <p>
     * Events should be fully qualified (e.g. {@code com.example.event.MY_EVENT}) to avoid
     * conflicts between {@link ConnectionService} implementations.  Further, custom
     * {@link ConnectionService} implementations shall not re-purpose events in the
     * {@code android.*} namespace, nor shall they define new event types in this namespace.  When
     * defining a custom event type, ensure the contents of the extras {@link Bundle} is clearly
     * defined.  Extra keys for this bundle should be named similar to the event type (e.g.
     * {@code com.example.extra.MY_EXTRA}).
     * <p>
     * When defining events and the associated extras, it is important to keep their behavior
     * consistent when the associated {@link ConnectionService} is updated.  Support for deprecated
     * events/extras should me maintained to ensure backwards compatibility with older
     * {@link InCallService} implementations which were built to support the older behavior.
     * <p>
     * Expected connection events from the Telephony stack are:
     * <p>
     * <ul>
     *      <li>{@link Connection#EVENT_CALL_HOLD_FAILED} with {@code null} {@code extras} when the
     *      {@link Conference} could not be held.</li>
     *      <li>{@link Connection#EVENT_MERGE_START} with {@code null} {@code extras} when a new
     *      call is being merged into the conference.</li>
     *      <li>{@link Connection#EVENT_MERGE_COMPLETE} with {@code null} {@code extras} a new call
     *      has completed being merged into the conference.</li>
     *      <li>{@link Connection#EVENT_CALL_MERGE_FAILED} with {@code null} {@code extras} a new
     *      call has failed to merge into the conference (the dialer app can determine which call
     *      failed to merge based on the fact that the call still exists outside of the conference
     *      at the end of the merge process).</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param event The conference event.
     * @param extras Optional bundle containing extra information associated with the event.
