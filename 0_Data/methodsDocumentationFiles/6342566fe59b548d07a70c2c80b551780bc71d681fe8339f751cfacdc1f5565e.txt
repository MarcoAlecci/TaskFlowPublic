         * Sets which restricted permissions to be whitelisted for the app. Whitelisting
         * is not granting the permissions, rather it allows the app to hold permissions
         * which are otherwise restricted. Whitelisting a non restricted permission has
         * no effect.
         *
         * <p> Permissions can be hard restricted which means that the app cannot hold
         * them or soft restricted where the app can hold the permission but in a weaker
         * form. Whether a permission is {@link PermissionInfo#FLAG_HARD_RESTRICTED hard
         * restricted} or {@link PermissionInfo#FLAG_SOFT_RESTRICTED soft restricted}
         * depends on the permission declaration. Whitelisting a hard restricted permission
         * allows the app to hold that permission and whitelisting a soft restricted
         * permission allows the app to hold the permission in its full, unrestricted form.
         *
         * <p> Permissions can also be immutably restricted which means that the whitelist
         * state of the permission can be determined only at install time and cannot be
         * changed on updated or at a later point via the package manager APIs.
         *
         * <p>Initially, all restricted permissions are whitelisted but you can change
         * which ones are whitelisted by calling this method or the corresponding ones
         * on the {@link PackageManager}. Only soft or hard restricted permissions on the current
         * Android version are supported and any invalid entries will be removed.
