     * Gets the name of the property that will be animated. This name will be used to derive
     * a setter function that will be called to set animated values.
     * For example, a property name of <code>foo</code> will result
     * in a call to the function <code>setFoo()</code> on the target object. If either
     * <code>valueFrom</code> or <code>valueTo</code> is null, then a getter function will
     * also be derived and called.
     *
     * <p>If this animator was created with a {@link Property} object instead of the
     * string name of a property, then this method will return the {@link
     * Property#getName() name} of that Property object instead. If this animator was
     * created with one or more {@link PropertyValuesHolder} objects, then this method
     * will return the {@link PropertyValuesHolder#getPropertyName() name} of that
     * object (if there was just one) or a comma-separated list of all of the
     * names (if there are more than one).</p>
