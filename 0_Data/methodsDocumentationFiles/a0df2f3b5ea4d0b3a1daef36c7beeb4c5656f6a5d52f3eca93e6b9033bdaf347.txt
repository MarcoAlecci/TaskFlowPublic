 Returns the view's optional matrix. This is applied to the
        view's drawable when it is drawn. If there is no matrix,
        this method will return an identity matrix.
        Do not change this matrix in place but make a copy.
        If you want a different matrix applied to the drawable,
        be sure to call setImageMatrix().
