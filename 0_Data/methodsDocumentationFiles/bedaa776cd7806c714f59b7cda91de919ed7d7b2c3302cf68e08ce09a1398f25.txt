     * Returns the number of bits in the two's complement representation of
     * {@code this} which differ from the sign bit. If {@code this} is negative,
     * the result is equivalent to the number of bits set in the two's
     * complement representation of {@code -this - 1}.
     *
     * <p>Use {@code bitLength(0)} to find the length of the binary value in
     * bits.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Note:</b> Usage of this method is not recommended as
     * the current implementation is not efficient.
