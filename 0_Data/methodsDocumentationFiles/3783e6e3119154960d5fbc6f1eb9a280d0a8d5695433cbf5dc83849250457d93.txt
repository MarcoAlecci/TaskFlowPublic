     * Approximate the <code>Path</code> with a series of line segments.
     * This returns float[] with the array containing point components.
     * There are three components for each point, in order:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Fraction along the length of the path that the point resides</li>
     *     <li>The x coordinate of the point</li>
     *     <li>The y coordinate of the point</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>Two points may share the same fraction along its length when there is
     * a move action within the Path.</p>
     *
     * @param acceptableError The acceptable error for a line on the
     *                        Path. Typically this would be 0.5 so that
     *                        the error is less than half a pixel.
     * @return An array of components for points approximating the Path.
