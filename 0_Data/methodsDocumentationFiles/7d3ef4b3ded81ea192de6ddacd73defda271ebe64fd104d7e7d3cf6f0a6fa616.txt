     * Apply multiple WindowContainer operations at once.
     * @param t The transaction to apply.
     * @param callback This transaction will use the synchronization scheme described in
     *        BLASTSyncEngine.java. The SurfaceControl transaction containing the effects of this
     *        WindowContainer transaction will be passed to this callback when ready.
     * @return An ID for the sync operation which will later be passed to transactionReady callback.
     *         This lets the caller differentiate overlapping sync operations.
