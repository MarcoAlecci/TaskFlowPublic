     * Returns the Transition that will be used to move Views in to the scene when returning due
     * to popping a back stack. The entering Views will be those that are regular Views
     * or ViewGroups that have {@link ViewGroup#isTransitionGroup} return true. Typical Transitions
     * will extend {@link android.transition.Visibility} as exiting is governed by changing
     * visibility from {@link View#VISIBLE} to {@link View#INVISIBLE}. If transition is null,
     * the views will remain unaffected. If nothing is set, the default will be to use the same
     * transition as {@link #setExitTransition(android.transition.Transition)}.
     *
     * @return the Transition to use to move Views into the scene when reentering from a
     *                   previously-started Activity.
