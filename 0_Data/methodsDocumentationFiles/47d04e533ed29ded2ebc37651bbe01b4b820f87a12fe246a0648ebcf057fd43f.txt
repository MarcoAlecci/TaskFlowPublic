     * Writes the audio data to the audio sink for playback (streaming mode),
     * or copies audio data for later playback (static buffer mode).
     * The format specified in the AudioTrack constructor should be
     * {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_8BIT} to correspond to the data in the array.
     * The format can be {@link AudioFormat#ENCODING_PCM_16BIT}, but this is deprecated.
     * <p>
     * In streaming mode, the write will normally block until all the data has been enqueued for
     * playback, and will return a full transfer count.  However, if the track is stopped or paused
     * on entry, or another thread interrupts the write by calling stop or pause, or an I/O error
     * occurs during the write, then the write may return a short transfer count.
     * <p>
     * In static buffer mode, copies the data to the buffer starting at offset 0.
     * Note that the actual playback of this data might occur after this function returns.
     *
     * @param audioData the array that holds the data to play.
     * @param offsetInBytes the offset expressed in bytes in audioData where the data to write
     *    starts.
     *    Must not be negative, or cause the data access to go out of bounds of the array.
     * @param sizeInBytes the number of bytes to write in audioData after the offset.
     *    Must not be negative, or cause the data access to go out of bounds of the array.
     * @return zero or the positive number of bytes that were written, or one of the following
     *    error codes. The number of bytes will be a multiple of the frame size in bytes
     *    not to exceed sizeInBytes.
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION} if the track isn't properly initialized</li>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR_BAD_VALUE} if the parameters don't resolve to valid data and indexes</li>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR_DEAD_OBJECT} if the AudioTrack is not valid anymore and
     *    needs to be recreated. The dead object error code is not returned if some data was
     *    successfully transferred. In this case, the error is returned at the next write()</li>
     * <li>{@link #ERROR} in case of other error</li>
     * </ul>
     * This is equivalent to {@link #write(byte[], int, int, int)} with <code>writeMode</code>
     * set to  {@link #WRITE_BLOCKING}.
