     * Register a component to be the sole receiver of MEDIA_BUTTON intents.  This is like
     * {@link #registerMediaButtonEventReceiver(android.content.ComponentName)}, but allows
     * the buttons to go to any PendingIntent.  Note that you should only use this form if
     * you know you will continue running for the full time until unregistering the
     * PendingIntent.
     * @param eventReceiver target that will receive media button intents.  The PendingIntent
     * will be sent an {@link Intent#ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON} event when a media button action
     * occurs, with {@link Intent#EXTRA_KEY_EVENT} added and holding the key code of the
     * media button that was pressed.
     * @deprecated Use {@link MediaSession#setMediaButtonReceiver(PendingIntent)} instead.
