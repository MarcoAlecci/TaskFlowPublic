     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} instance with the specified scale.
     * <p>
     * If the new scale is greater than the old scale, then additional zeros are
     * added to the unscaled value. In this case no rounding is necessary.
     * <p>
     * If the new scale is smaller than the old scale, then trailing digits are
     * removed. If these trailing digits are not zero, then the remaining
     * unscaled value has to be rounded. For this rounding operation the
     * specified rounding mode is used.
     *
     * @param newScale
     *            scale of the result returned.
     * @param roundingMode
     *            rounding mode to be used to round the result.
     * @return a new {@code BigDecimal} instance with the specified scale.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *             if {@code roundingMode} is not a valid rounding mode.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code roundingMode == ROUND_UNNECESSARY} and rounding is
     *             necessary according to the given scale.
