     * recording changes. Any mutations to the RenderNode content, or any of the RenderNode's
     * contained within the content node, will be applied whenever a new {@link FrameRenderRequest}
     * is issued via {@link #createRenderRequest()} and {@link FrameRenderRequest#syncAndDraw()}.
     *
     * @param content The content to set as the root RenderNode. If null the content root is removed
     *                and the renderer will draw nothing.
