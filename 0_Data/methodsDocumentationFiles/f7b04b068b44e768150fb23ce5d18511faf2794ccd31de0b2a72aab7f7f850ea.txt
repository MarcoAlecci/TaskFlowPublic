     * Sets the screen brightness to use while dozing.
     * <p>
     * The value of this property determines the power state of the primary display
     * once {@link #startDozing} has been called.  The default value is
     * {@link PowerManager#BRIGHTNESS_DEFAULT} which lets the system decide.
     * The dream may set a different brightness before starting to doze and may adjust
     * the brightness while dozing to conserve power and achieve various effects.
     * </p><p>
     * Note that dream may specify any brightness in the full 0-255 range, including
     * values that are less than the minimum value for manual screen brightness
     * adjustments by the user.  In particular, the value may be set to 0 which may
     * turn off the backlight entirely while still leaving the screen on although
     * this behavior is device dependent and not guaranteed.
     * </p><p>
     * The available range of display brightness values and their behavior while dozing is
     * hardware dependent and may vary across devices.  The dream may therefore
     * need to be modified or configured to correctly support the hardware.

     * @param brightness The screen brightness while dozing as a value between
     * {@link PowerManager#BRIGHTNESS_OFF} (0) and {@link PowerManager#BRIGHTNESS_ON} (255),
     * or {@link PowerManager#BRIGHTNESS_DEFAULT} (-1) to ask the system to apply
     * its default policy based on the screen state.
     *
     * @hide For use by system UI components only.
