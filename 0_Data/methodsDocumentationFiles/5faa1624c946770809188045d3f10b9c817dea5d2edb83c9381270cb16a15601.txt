     * Ask that all user data be wiped. If called as a secondary user, the user will be removed and
     * other users will remain unaffected, the provided reason for wiping data can be shown to
     * user. Calling from the primary user will cause the device to reboot, erasing all device data
     * - including all the secondary users and their data - while booting up. In this case, we don't
     * show the reason to the user since the device would be factory reset.
     * <p>
     * The calling device admin must have requested {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_WIPE_DATA} to
     * be able to call this method; if it has not, a security exception will be thrown.
     *
     * If the caller is a profile owner of an organization-owned managed profile, it may
     * additionally call this method on the parent instance.
     * Calling this method on the parent {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance would wipe the
     * entire device, while calling it on the current profile instance would relinquish the device
     * for personal use, removing the managed profile and all policies set by the profile owner.
     *
     * @param flags Bit mask of additional options: currently supported flags are
     *            {@link #WIPE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, {@link #WIPE_RESET_PROTECTION_DATA} and
     *            {@link #WIPE_EUICC}.
     * @param reason a string that contains the reason for wiping data, which can be
     *            presented to the user.
     * @throws SecurityException if the calling application does not own an active administrator
     *            that uses {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_WIPE_DATA}
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the input reason string is null or empty, or if
     *            {@link #WIPE_SILENTLY} is set.
