     * Requests a CAS session resource.
     *
     * <p>There are three possible scenarios:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If there is Cas session available, the API would send the id back.
     *
     * <li>If no Cas system is available but the current request info can show higher priority than
     * other uses of the cas sessions under the requested cas system, the API will send
     * {@link IResourcesReclaimListener#onReclaimResources()} to the {@link Tuner}. Tuner would
     * handle the resource reclaim on the holder of lower priority and notify the holder of its
     * resource loss.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> {@link #updateCasInfo(int, int)} must be called before this
     * request.
     *
     * @param request {@link CasSessionRequest} information of the current request.
     * @param casSessionHandle a one-element array to return the granted cas session handel.
     *                         If no CAS granted, this will return {@link #INVALID_RESOURCE_HANDLE}.
     *
     * @return true if there is CAS session granted.
