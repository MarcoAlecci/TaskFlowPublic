     * Called each time a new batch of network logs can be retrieved. This callback method will only
     * ever be called when network logging is enabled. The logs can only be retrieved while network
     * logging is enabled.
     *
     * <p>If a secondary user or profile is created, this callback won't be received until all users
     * become affiliated again (even if network logging is enabled). It will also no longer be
     * possible to retrieve the network logs batch with the most recent {@code batchToken} provided
     * by this callback. See {@link DevicePolicyManager#setAffiliationIds}.
     *
     * <p> This callback is only applicable if the delegated app has
     * {@link DevicePolicyManager#DELEGATION_NETWORK_LOGGING} capability. Additionally, it must
     * declare an intent filter for {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#ACTION_NETWORK_LOGS_AVAILABLE} in the
     * receiver's manifest in order to receive this callback. The default implementation
     * simply throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * @param context The running context as per {@link #onReceive}.
     * @param intent The received intent as per {@link #onReceive}.
     * @param batchToken The token representing the current batch of network logs.
     * @param networkLogsCount The total count of events in the current batch of network logs.
