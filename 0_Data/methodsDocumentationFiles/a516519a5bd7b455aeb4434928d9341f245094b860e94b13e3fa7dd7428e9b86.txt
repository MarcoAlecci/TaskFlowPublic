     * connected, it cannot be selected as active.
     *
     * <p> This API returns false in scenarios like the profile on the

     * When this API returns true, it is guaranteed that the
     * {@link #ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED} intent will be broadcasted
     * with the active device.
     *
