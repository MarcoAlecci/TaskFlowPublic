     * Requests a Tuner Demux resource.
     *
     * <p>There are three possible scenarios:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If there is Demux available, the API would send the handle back.
     *
     * <li>If no Demux is available but the current request has a higher priority than other uses of
     * demuxes, the API will send {@link IResourcesReclaimListener#onReclaimResources()} to the
     * {@link Tuner}. Tuner would handle the resource reclaim on the holder of lower priority and
     * notify the holder of its resource loss.
     *
     * <li>If no Demux system can be granted, the API would return false.
     * <ul>
     *
     * @param request {@link TunerDemuxRequest} information of the current request.
     * @param demuxHandle a one-element array to return the granted Demux handle.
     *                    If no Demux granted, this will return {@link #INVALID_RESOURCE_HANDLE}.
     *
     * @return true if there is Demux granted.
