     * Encrypts or decrypts data in a single-part operation, or finishes a
     * multiple-part operation. The data is encrypted or decrypted,
     * depending on how this cipher was initialized.
     *
     * <p>The first <code>inputLen</code> bytes in the <code>input</code>
     * buffer, starting at <code>inputOffset</code> inclusive, and any input
     * bytes that may have been buffered during a previous
     * <code>update</code> operation, are processed, with padding
     * (if requested) being applied.
     * If an AEAD mode such as GCM/CCM is being used, the authentication
     * tag is appended in the case of encryption, or verified in the
     * case of decryption.
     * The result is stored in the <code>output</code> buffer, starting at
     * <code>outputOffset</code> inclusive.
     *
     * <p>If the <code>output</code> buffer is too small to hold the result,
     * a <code>ShortBufferException</code> is thrown. In this case, repeat this
     * call with a larger output buffer. Use
     * {@link #getOutputSize(int) getOutputSize} to determine how big
     * the output buffer should be.
     *
     * <p>Upon finishing, this method resets this cipher object to the state
     * it was in when previously initialized via a call to <code>init</code>.
     * That is, the object is reset and available to encrypt or decrypt
     * (depending on the operation mode that was specified in the call to
     * <code>init</code>) more data.
     *
     * <p>Note: if any exception is thrown, this cipher object may need to
     * be reset before it can be used again.
     *
     * <p>Note: this method should be copy-safe, which means the
     * <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> buffers can reference
     * the same byte array and no unprocessed input data is overwritten
     * when the result is copied into the output buffer.
