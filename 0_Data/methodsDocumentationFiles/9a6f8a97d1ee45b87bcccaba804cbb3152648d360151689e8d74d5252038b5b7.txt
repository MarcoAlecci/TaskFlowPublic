     * Show a dialog managed by this activity.  A call to {@link #onCreateDialog(int, Bundle)}
     * will be made with the same id the first time this is called for a given
     * id.  From thereafter, the dialog will be automatically saved and restored.
     *
     * <em>If you are targeting {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}
     * or later, consider instead using a {@link DialogFragment} instead.</em>
     *
     * <p>Each time a dialog is shown, {@link #onPrepareDialog(int, Dialog, Bundle)} will
     * be made to provide an opportunity to do any timely preparation.
     *
     * @param id The id of the managed dialog.
     * @param args Arguments to pass through to the dialog.  These will be saved
     * and restored for you.  Note that if the dialog is already created,
     * {@link #onCreateDialog(int, Bundle)} will not be called with the new
     * arguments but {@link #onPrepareDialog(int, Dialog, Bundle)} will be.
     * If you need to rebuild the dialog, call {@link #removeDialog(int)} first.
     * @return Returns true if the Dialog was created; false is returned if
     * it is not created because {@link #onCreateDialog(int, Bundle)} returns false.
     *
