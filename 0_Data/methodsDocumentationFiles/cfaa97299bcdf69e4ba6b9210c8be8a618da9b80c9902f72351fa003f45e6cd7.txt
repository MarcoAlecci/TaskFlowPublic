     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} whose value is {@code this}, rounded
     * according to the passed context {@code mc}.
     * <p>
     * If {@code mc.precision = 0}, then no rounding is performed.
     * <p>
     * If {@code mc.precision > 0} and {@code mc.roundingMode == UNNECESSARY},
     * then an {@code ArithmeticException} is thrown if the result cannot be
     * represented exactly within the given precision.
     *
     * @param mc
     *            rounding mode and precision for the result of this operation.
     * @return {@code this} rounded according to the passed context.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code mc.precision > 0} and {@code mc.roundingMode ==
     *             UNNECESSARY} and this cannot be represented within the given
     *             precision.
