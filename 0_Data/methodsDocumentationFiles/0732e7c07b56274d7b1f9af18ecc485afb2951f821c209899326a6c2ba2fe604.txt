     * Retrieve the boolean value for the attribute at <var>index</var>.
     * <p>
     * If the attribute is an integer value, this method returns false if the
     * attribute is equal to zero, and true otherwise.
     * If the attribute is not a boolean or integer value,
     * this method will attempt to coerce it to an integer using
     * {@link Integer#decode(String)} and return whether it is equal to zero.
     *
     * @param index Index of attribute to retrieve.
     * @param defValue Value to return if the attribute is not defined or
     *                 cannot be coerced to an integer.
     *
     * @return Boolean value of the attribute, or defValue if the attribute was
     *         not defined or could not be coerced to an integer.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the TypedArray has already been recycled.
