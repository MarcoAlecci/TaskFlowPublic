     * Convenience for constructing a {@link MediaScannerConnection}, calling
     * {@link #connect} on it, and calling {@link #scanFile(String, String)} with the given
     * <var>path</var> and <var>mimeType</var> when the connection is
     * established.
     * @param context The caller's Context, required for establishing a connection to
     * the media scanner service.
     * Success or failure of the scanning operation cannot be determined until
     * {@link MediaScannerConnectionClient#onScanCompleted(String, Uri)} is called.
     * @param paths Array of paths to be scanned.
     * @param mimeTypes Optional array of MIME types for each path.
     * If mimeType is null, then the mimeType will be inferred from the file extension.
     * @param callback Optional callback through which you can receive the
     * scanned URI and MIME type; If null, the file will be scanned but
     * you will not get a result back.
     * @see #scanFile(String, String)
