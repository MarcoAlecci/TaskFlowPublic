     * The {@link InCallService} will create the {@code requestProfile} based on the current
     * video state (i.e. {@link Call.Details#getVideoState()}).  It is, however, possible that the
     * video state maintained by the {@link InCallService} could get out of sync with what is known
     * by the {@link android.telecom.Connection.VideoProvider}.  To remove ambiguity, the
     * {@link VideoCallImpl} passes along the pre-modify video profile to the {@code VideoProvider}
     * to ensure it has full context of the requested change.
     *
     * @param requestProfile The requested video profile.
