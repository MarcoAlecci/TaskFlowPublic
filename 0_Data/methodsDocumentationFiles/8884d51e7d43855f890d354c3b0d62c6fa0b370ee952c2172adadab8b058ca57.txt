     * Schedule an immediate backup attempt for all pending key/value updates.  This
     * is primarily intended for transports to use when they detect a suitable
     * opportunity for doing a backup pass.  If there are no pending updates to
     * be sent, no action will be taken.  Even if some updates are pending, the
     * transport will still be asked to confirm via the usual requestBackupTime()
     * method.
