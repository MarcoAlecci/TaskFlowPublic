         * Called after a full layout calculation is finished. The layout calculation may include
         * multiple {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, State)} calls due to animations or
         * layout measurement but it will include only one {@link #onLayoutCompleted(State)} call.
         * This method will be called at the end of {@link View#layout(int, int, int, int)} call.
         * <p>
         * This is a good place for the LayoutManager to do some cleanup like pending scroll
         * position, saved state etc.
         *
         * @param state Transient state of RecyclerView
