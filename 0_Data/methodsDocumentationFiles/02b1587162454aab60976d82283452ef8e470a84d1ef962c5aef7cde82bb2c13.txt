     * <p>
     * Causes the handler thread's looper to terminate as soon as all remaining messages
     * in the message queue that are already due to be delivered have been handled.
     * Pending delayed messages with due times in the future will not be delivered.
     * </p><p>
     * Any attempt to post messages to the queue after the looper is asked to quit will fail.
     * For example, the {@link Handler#sendMessage(Message)} method will return false.
     * </p><p>
     * If the thread has not been started or has finished (that is if
     * {@link #getLooper} returns null), then false is returned.
     * Otherwise the looper is asked to quit and true is returned.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return True if the looper looper has been asked to quit or false if the
     * thread had not yet started running.
