     * Runs k-means on the input data (X) trying to find k means.
     *
     * K-Means is known for getting stuck into local optima, so you might
     * want to run it multiple time and argmax on {@link KMeans#score(List)}
     *
     * @param k The number of points to return.
     * @param inputData Input data.
     * @return An array of k Means, each representing a centroid and data points that belong to it.
