     * Allocate the requested number of bytes for your application to use on the
     * given storage volume. This will cause the system to delete any cached
     * files necessary to satisfy your request.
     * <p>
     * Attempts to allocate disk space beyond the value returned by
     * {@link #getAllocatableBytes(UUID)} will fail.
     * <p>
     * Since multiple apps can be running simultaneously, this method may be
     * subject to race conditions. If possible, consider using
     * {@link #allocateBytes(FileDescriptor, long)} which will guarantee
     * that bytes are allocated to an opened file.
     * <p>
     * If you're progressively allocating an unbounded amount of storage space
     * (such as when recording a video) you should avoid calling this method
     * more than once every 60 seconds.
     *
     * @param storageUuid the UUID of the storage volume where you'd like to
     *            allocate disk space. The UUID for a specific path can be
     *            obtained using {@link #getUuidForPath(File)}.
     * @param bytes the number of bytes to allocate.
     * @throws IOException when the storage device isn't present, or when it
     *             doesn't support allocating space, or if the device had
     *             trouble allocating the requested space.
