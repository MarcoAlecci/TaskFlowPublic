     * The {@code selectedIndex} represents the index of the card that should be presented in the
     * 'selected' position when the cards are initially displayed in the quick access wallet.  The
     * {@code selectedIndex} should be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the
     * list of {@link WalletCard walletCards}, unless the list is empty in which case the {@code
     * selectedIndex} can take any value. 0 is a nice round number for such cases.
