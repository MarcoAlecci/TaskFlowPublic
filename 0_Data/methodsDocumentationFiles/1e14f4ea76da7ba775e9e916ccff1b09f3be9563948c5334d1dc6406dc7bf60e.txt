     * <p>Performs the chromatic adaptation of a color space from its native
     * white point to the specified white point.</p>
     *
     * <p>The chromatic adaptation is performed using the

     * @param colorSpace The color space to chromatically adapt
     * @param whitePoint The new white point
     * @return A {@link ColorSpace} instance with the same name, primaries,
     *         transfer functions and range as the specified color space
