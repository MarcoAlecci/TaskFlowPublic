         * <p><b>Note: </b> on Android {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O}, the total number of
         * datasets is limited by the Binder transaction size, so it's recommended to keep it
         * small (in the range of 10-20 at most) and use pagination by adding a fake
         * {@link Dataset.Builder#setAuthentication(IntentSender) authenticated dataset} at the end
         * with a presentation string like "Next 10" that would return a new {@link FillResponse}
         * with the next 10 datasets, and so on. This limitation was lifted on
         * Android {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O_MR1}, although the Binder transaction
         * size can still be reached if each dataset itself is too big.
