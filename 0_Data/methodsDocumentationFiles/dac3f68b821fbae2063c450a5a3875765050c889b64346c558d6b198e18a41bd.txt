         * Sets a fallback family name.
         *
         * By specifying a fallback family name, a fallback Typeface will be returned if the
         * {@link #build} method fails to create a Typeface from the provided font. The fallback
         * family will be resolved with the provided weight and italic information specified by
         * {@link #setWeight} and {@link #setItalic}.
         *
         * If {@link #setWeight} is not called, the fallback family keeps the default weight.
         * Similary, if {@link #setItalic} is not called, the fallback family keeps the default
         * italic information. For example, calling {@code builder.setFallback("sans-serif-light")}
         * is equivalent to calling {@code builder.setFallback("sans-serif").setWeight(300)} in
         * terms of fallback. The default weight and italic information are overridden by calling
         * {@link #setWeight} and {@link #setItalic}. For example, if a Typeface is constructed
         * using {@code builder.setFallback("sans-serif-light").setWeight(700)}, the fallback text
         * will render as sans serif bold.
         *
         * @param familyName A family name to be used for fallback if the provided font can not be
         *                   used. By passing {@code null}, build() returns {@code null}.
         *                   If {@link #setFallback} is not called on the builder, {@code null}
         *                   is assumed.
