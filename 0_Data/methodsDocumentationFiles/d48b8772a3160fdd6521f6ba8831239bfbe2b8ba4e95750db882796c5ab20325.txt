     * Request a network to satisfy a set of {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities}.
     *
     * This function behaves identically to the version that takes a NetworkCallback, but instead
     * of {@link NetworkCallback} a {@link PendingIntent} is used.  This means
     * the request may outlive the calling application and get called back when a suitable
     * network is found.
     * <p>
     * The operation is an Intent broadcast that goes to a broadcast receiver that
     * you registered with {@link Context#registerReceiver} or through the
     * &lt;receiver&gt; tag in an AndroidManifest.xml file
     * <p>
     * The operation Intent is delivered with two extras, a {@link Network} typed
     * extra called {@link #EXTRA_NETWORK} and a {@link NetworkRequest}
     * typed extra called {@link #EXTRA_NETWORK_REQUEST} containing
     * the original requests parameters.  It is important to create a new,
     * {@link NetworkCallback} based request before completing the processing of the
     * Intent to reserve the network or it will be released shortly after the Intent
     * is processed.
     * <p>
     * If there is already a request for this Intent registered (with the equality of
     * two Intents defined by {@link Intent#filterEquals}), then it will be removed and
     * replaced by this one, effectively releasing the previous {@link NetworkRequest}.
     * <p>
     * The request may be released normally by calling
     * {@link #releaseNetworkRequest(android.app.PendingIntent)}.
     * <p>It is presently unsupported to request a network with either
     * {@link NetworkCapabilities#NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED} or
     * {@link NetworkCapabilities#NET_CAPABILITY_CAPTIVE_PORTAL}
     * as these {@code NetworkCapabilities} represent states that a particular
     * network may never attain, and whether a network will attain these states
     * is unknown prior to bringing up the network so the framework does not
     * know how to go about satisfying a request with these capabilities.
     *
     * <p>To avoid performance issues due to apps leaking callbacks, the system will limit the
     * number of outstanding requests to 100 per app (identified by their UID), shared with
     * all variants of this method, of {@link #registerNetworkCallback} as well as
     * {@link ConnectivityDiagnosticsManager#registerConnectivityDiagnosticsCallback}.
     * Requesting a network with this method will count toward this limit. If this limit is
     * exceeded, an exception will be thrown. To avoid hitting this issue and to conserve resources,
     * make sure to unregister the callbacks with {@link #unregisterNetworkCallback(PendingIntent)}
     * or {@link #releaseNetworkRequest(PendingIntent)}.
     *
     * <p>This method requires the caller to hold either the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE} permission
     * or the ability to modify system settings as determined by
     * {@link android.provider.Settings.System#canWrite}.</p>
     *
     * @param request {@link NetworkRequest} describing this request.
     * @param operation Action to perform when the network is available (corresponds
     *                  to the {@link NetworkCallback#onAvailable} call.  Typically
     *                  comes from {@link PendingIntent#getBroadcast}. Cannot be null.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code request} contains invalid network capabilities.
     * @throws SecurityException if missing the appropriate permissions.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the app already has too many callbacks registered.
