     * user. If successful, this would allow the user to leave quiet mode automatically without
     * additional user authentication.
     *
     * This is made possible by the framework storing an encrypted copy of the unified challenge
     * auth-bound to the primary user's lockscreen. As long as the primery user has unlocked
     * recently (7 days), the framework will be able to decrypt it and plug the secret into the
     * unlock flow.

     * @return {@code true} if automatic unlocking is successful, {@code false} otherwise.
