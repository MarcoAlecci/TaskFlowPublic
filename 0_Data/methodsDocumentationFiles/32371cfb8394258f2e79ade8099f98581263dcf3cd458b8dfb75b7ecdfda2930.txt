     * If {@code isPreferred} is true, this method requests that the connected display does minimal
     * post processing when this window is visible on the screen. Otherwise, it requests that the
     * display switches back to standard image processing.
     *
     * <p> By default, the display does not do minimal post processing and if this is desired, this
     * method should not be used. It should be used with {@code isPreferred=true} when low
     * latency has a higher priority than image enhancement processing (e.g. for games or video
     * conferencing). The display will automatically go back into standard image processing mode
     * when no window requesting minimal posst processing is visible on screen anymore.
     * {@code setPreferMinimalPostProcessing(false)} can be used if
     * {@code setPreferMinimalPostProcessing(true)} was previously called for this window and
     * minimal post processing is no longer required.
     *
     * <p>If the Display sink is connected via HDMI, the device will begin to send infoframes with
     * Auto Low Latency Mode enabled and Game Content Type. This will switch the connected display
     * to a minimal image processing mode (if available), which reduces latency, improving the user
     * experience for gaming or video conferencing applications. For more information, see HDMI 2.1
     * specification.
     *
     * <p>If the Display sink has an internal connection or uses some other protocol than HDMI,
     * effects may be similar but implementation-defined.
     *
     * <p>The ability to switch to a mode with minimal post proessing may be disabled by a user
     * setting in the system settings menu. In that case, this method does nothing.
