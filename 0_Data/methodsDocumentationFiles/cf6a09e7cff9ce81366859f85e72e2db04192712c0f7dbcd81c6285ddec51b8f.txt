     * Hard stops rendering into the surface. If the renderer is stopped it will
     * block any attempt to render. Calls to {@link FrameRenderRequest#syncAndDraw()} will
     * still sync over the latest rendering content, however they will not render and instead
     * {@link #SYNC_CONTEXT_IS_STOPPED} will be returned.
     *
     * <p>If false is passed then rendering will resume as normal. Any pending rendering requests
     * will produce a new frame at the next vsync signal.
     *
     * <p>This is useful in combination with lifecycle events such as {@link Activity#onStop()}
     * and {@link Activity#onStart()}.
     *
     * @param stopped true to stop all rendering, false to resume
     * @hide
