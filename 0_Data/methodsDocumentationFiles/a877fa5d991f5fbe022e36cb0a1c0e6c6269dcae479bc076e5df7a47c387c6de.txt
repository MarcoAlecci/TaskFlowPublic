     * Apply this matrix to the array of 2D vectors specified by src, and write the transformed
     * vectors into the array of vectors specified by dst. The two arrays represent their "vectors"
     * as pairs of floats [x, y]. Note: this method does not apply the translation associated with
     * the matrix. Use {@link Matrix#mapPoints(float[], float[])} if you want the translation to be
     * applied.
     *
     * @param dst The array of dst vectors (x,y pairs)
     * @param src The array of src vectors (x,y pairs)
