         * gets the noise gate threshold in decibels (dB) from 0 dB Full Scale (dBFS). Noise gate
         * thresholds are negative. Signals below this level will be expanded according the
         * expanderRatio parameter. A Noise Gate Threshold of -75 dB means very quiet signals might
         * be effectively removed from the signal.
         * @return Noise Gate Threshold in decibels (dB)
