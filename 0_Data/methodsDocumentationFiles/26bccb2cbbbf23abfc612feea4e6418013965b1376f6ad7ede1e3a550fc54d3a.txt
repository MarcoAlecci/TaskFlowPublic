     * A convenience wrapper that takes the current {@link ThreadPolicy} from {@link
     * #getThreadPolicy}, modifies it to permit both disk reads &amp; writes, and sets the new
     * policy with {@link #setThreadPolicy}, returning the old policy so you can restore it at the
     * end of a block.
     *
     * @return the old policy, to be passed to {@link #setThreadPolicy} to restore the policy at the
     *     end of a block
