     * Compares this certification path for equality with the specified
     * object. Two {@code CertPath}s are equal if and only if their
     * types are equal and their certificate {@code List}s (and by
     * implication the {@code Certificate}s in those {@code List}s)
     * are equal. A {@code CertPath} is never equal to an object that is
     * not a {@code CertPath}.
     * <p>
     * This algorithm is implemented by this method. If it is overridden,
     * the behavior specified here must be maintained.

     * @param other the object to test for equality with this certification path
     * @return true if the specified object is equal to this certification path,
     * false otherwise
