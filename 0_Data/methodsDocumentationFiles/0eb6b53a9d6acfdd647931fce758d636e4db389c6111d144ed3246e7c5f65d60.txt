     * Setting this flag tells ChangeBounds to track the before/after parent
     * of every view using this transition. The flag is not enabled by
     * default because it requires the parent instances to be the same
     * in the two scenes or else all parents must use ids to allow
     * the transition to determine which parents are the same.
     *
     * @param reparent true if the transition should track the parent
     * container of target views and animate parent changes.
     * @deprecated Use {@link android.transition.ChangeTransform} to handle
     * transitions between different parents.
