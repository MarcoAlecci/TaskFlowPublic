     * Notify the host application that an HTTP error has been received from the server while
     * loading a resource.  HTTP errors have status codes &gt;= 400.  This callback will be called
     * for any resource (iframe, image, etc.), not just for the main page. Thus, it is recommended
     * to perform minimum required work in this callback. Note that the content of the server
     * response may not be provided within the {@code errorResponse} parameter.
     * @param view The WebView that is initiating the callback.
     * @param request The originating request.
     * @param errorResponse Information about the error occurred.
