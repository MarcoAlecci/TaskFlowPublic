     * Query network usage statistics summaries. Result is summarised data usage for the whole
     * device. Result is a single Bucket aggregated over time, state, uid, tag, metered, and
     * roaming. This means the bucket's start and end timestamp are going to be the same as the
     * 'startTime' and 'endTime' parameters. State is going to be
     * {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#STATE_ALL}, uid {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#UID_ALL},
     * tag {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#TAG_NONE},
     * default network {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#DEFAULT_NETWORK_ALL},
     * metered {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#METERED_ALL},
     * and roaming {@link NetworkStats.Bucket#ROAMING_ALL}.
     *
     * @param networkType As defined in {@link ConnectivityManager}, e.g.
     *            {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_MOBILE}, {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_WIFI}
     *            etc.
     * @param subscriberId If applicable, the subscriber id of the network interface.
     *                     <p>Starting with API level 29, the {@code subscriberId} is guarded by
     *                     additional restrictions. Calling apps that do not meet the new
     *                     requirements to access the {@code subscriberId} can provide a {@code
     *                     null} value when querying for the mobile network type to receive usage
     *                     for all mobile networks. For additional details see {@link
     *                     TelephonyManager#getSubscriberId()}.
     * @param startTime Start of period. Defined in terms of "Unix time", see
     *            {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis}.
     * @param endTime End of period. Defined in terms of "Unix time", see
     *            {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis}.
     * @return Bucket object or null if permissions are insufficient or error happened during
     *         statistics collection.
