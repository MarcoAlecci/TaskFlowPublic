     * Shows the popup menu and makes a best-effort to anchor it to the
     * specified (x,y) coordinate relative to the anchor view.
     * <p>
     * Additionally, the popup's transition epicenter (see
     * {@link android.widget.PopupWindow#setEpicenterBounds(Rect)} will be
     * centered on the specified coordinate, rather than using the bounds of
     * the anchor view.
     * <p>
     * If the popup's resolved gravity is {@link Gravity#LEFT}, this will
     * display the popup with its top-left corner at (x,y) relative to the
     * anchor view. If the resolved gravity is {@link Gravity#RIGHT}, the
     * popup's top-right corner will be at (x,y).
     * <p>
     * If the popup cannot be displayed fully on-screen, this method will
     * attempt to scroll the anchor view's ancestors and/or offset the popup
     * such that it may be displayed fully on-screen.

     * @param x x coordinate relative to the anchor view
     * @param y y coordinate relative to the anchor view
     * @return {@code true} if the popup was shown or was already showing prior
     *         to calling this method, {@code false} otherwise
