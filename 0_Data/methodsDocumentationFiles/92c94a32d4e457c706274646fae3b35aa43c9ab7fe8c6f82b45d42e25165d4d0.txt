     * Inform the notification manager about dismissal of all notifications.
     * <p>
     * Use this if your listener has a user interface that allows the user to dismiss all
     * notifications, similar to the behavior of Android's status bar and notification panel.
     * It should be called after the user invokes the "dismiss all" function of your UI;
     * upon being informed, the notification manager will actually remove all active notifications
     * and you will get multiple {@link #onNotificationRemoved(StatusBarNotification)} callbacks.
     *
     * <p>The service should wait for the {@link #onListenerConnected()} event
     * before performing this operation.
     *
     * {@see #cancelNotification(String, String, int)}
