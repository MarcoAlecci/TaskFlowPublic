     * Draw a series of lines. Each line is taken from 4 consecutive values in the pts array. Thus
     * to draw 1 line, the array must contain at least 4 values. This is logically the same as
     * drawing the array as follows: drawLine(pts[0], pts[1], pts[2], pts[3]) followed by
     * drawLine(pts[4], pts[5], pts[6], pts[7]) and so on.
     *
     * @param pts Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...]
     * @param offset Number of values in the array to skip before drawing.
     * @param count The number of values in the array to process, after skipping "offset" of them.
     *            Since each line uses 4 values, the number of "lines" that are drawn is really
     *            (count >> 2).
     * @param paint The paint used to draw the points
