     * and reported to {@link android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService}s
     * that explore the window content.

     * If this method returns an instance, this instance is responsible for managing
     * {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo}s describing the virtual sub-tree rooted at this
     * View including the one representing the View itself. Similarly the returned
     * instance is responsible for performing accessibility actions on any virtual
     * view or the root view itself.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If an {@link AccessibilityDelegate} has been specified via calling
     * {@link #setAccessibilityDelegate(AccessibilityDelegate)} its
     * {@link AccessibilityDelegate#getAccessibilityNodeProvider(View)}
     * is responsible for handling this call.
