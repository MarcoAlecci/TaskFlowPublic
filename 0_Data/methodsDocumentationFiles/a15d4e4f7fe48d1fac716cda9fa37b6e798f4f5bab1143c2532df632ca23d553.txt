     * Broadcast the given intent to all interested BroadcastReceivers.  This
     * call is asynchronous; it returns immediately, and you will continue
     * executing while the receivers are run.  No results are propagated from
     * receivers and receivers can not abort the broadcast. If you want
     * to allow receivers to propagate results or abort the broadcast, you must
     * send an ordered broadcast using
     * {@link #sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)}.
     *
     * <p>See {@link BroadcastReceiver} for more information on Intent broadcasts.
     *
     * @param intent The Intent to broadcast; all receivers matching this
     *               Intent will receive the broadcast.
