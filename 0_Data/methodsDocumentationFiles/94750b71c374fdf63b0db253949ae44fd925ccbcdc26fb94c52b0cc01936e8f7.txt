     * Retrieve the codec name.
     *
     * If the codec was created by createDecoderByType or createEncoderByType, what component is
     * chosen is not known beforehand. This method returns the name of the codec that was
     * selected by the platform.
     *
     * <strong>Note:</strong> Implementations may provide multiple aliases (codec
     * names) for the same underlying codec, any of which can be used to instantiate the same
     * underlying codec in {@link MediaCodec#createByCodecName}. This method returns the
     * name used to create the codec in this case.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if in the Released state.
