     * Like {@link #checkSignatures(String, String)}, but takes UIDs of
     * the two packages to be checked.  This can be useful, for example,
     * when doing the check in an IPC, where the UID is the only identity
     * available.  It is functionally identical to determining the package
     * associated with the UIDs and checking their signatures.
     *
     * @param uid1 First UID whose signature will be compared.
     * @param uid2 Second UID whose signature will be compared.
     *
     * @return Returns an integer indicating whether all signatures on the
     * two packages match. The value is >= 0 ({@link #SIGNATURE_MATCH}) if
     * all signatures match or < 0 if there is not a match ({@link
     * #SIGNATURE_NO_MATCH} or {@link #SIGNATURE_UNKNOWN_PACKAGE}).
