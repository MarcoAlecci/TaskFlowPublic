     * Start a new activity as if it was started by the activity that started our
     * current activity.  This is for the resolver and chooser activities, which operate
     * as intermediaries that dispatch their intent to the target the user selects -- to
     * do this, they must perform all security checks including permission grants as if
     * their launch had come from the original activity.
     * @param intent The Intent to start.
     * @param options ActivityOptions or null.
     * @param permissionToken Token received from the system that permits this call to be made.
     * @param ignoreTargetSecurity If true, the activity manager will not check whether the
     * caller it is doing the start is, is actually allowed to start the target activity.
     * If you set this to true, you must set an explicit component in the Intent and do any
     * appropriate security checks yourself.
     * @param userId The user the new activity should run as.
     * @hide
