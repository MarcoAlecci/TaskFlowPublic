     * Get an estimator for the movements of a pointer using past movements of the
     * pointer to predict future movements.
     *
     * It is not necessary to call {@link #computeCurrentVelocity(int)} before calling
     * this method.
     *
     * @param id Which pointer's velocity to return.
     * @param outEstimator The estimator to populate.
     * @return True if an estimator was obtained, false if there is no information
     * available about the pointer.
     *
     * @hide For internal use only.  Not a final API.
