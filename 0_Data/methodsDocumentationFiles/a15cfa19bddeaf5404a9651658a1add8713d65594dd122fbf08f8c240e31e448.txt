     *    {@link AudioAttributes.Builder#setAllowedCapturePolicy(int)} </li>
     * <li> application-wide at runtime, with this method </li>
     * <li> application-wide at build time, see {@code allowAudioPlaybackCapture} in the application
     *       manifest. </li>
     * </ul>
     * The most restrictive policy is always applied.
     *
     * See {@link AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration} for more details on
