     * This is used by the RootView to perform an optimization when
     * the view hierarchy contains one or several SurfaceView.
     * SurfaceView is always considered transparent, but its children are not,
     * therefore all View objects remove themselves from the global transparent
     * region (passed as a parameter to this function).
     *
     * @param region The transparent region for this ViewAncestor (window).
     *
     * @return Returns true if the effective visibility of the view at this
     * point is opaque, regardless of the transparent region; returns false
     * if it is possible for underlying windows to be seen behind the view.
     *
     * {@hide}
