     * Sentence-case (first character uppercased).
     *
     * <p>There is no good API available for this, not even in ICU.
     * We can revisit this if we get some ICU support later.</p>
     *
     * <p>There are currently several tickets requesting this feature:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>ICU needs to provide an easy way to titlecase only one first letter
     *   http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/11729</li>
     * <li>Add "initial case"
     *    http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8394</li>
     * <li>Add code for initialCase, toTitlecase don't modify after Lt,
     *   avoid 49Ers, low-level language-specific casing
     *   http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/10410</li>
     * <li>BreakIterator.getFirstInstance: Often you need to titlecase just the first
     *   word, and leave the rest of the string alone.  (closed as duplicate)
     *   http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8946</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>A (clunky) option with the current ICU API is:</p>
     * {{
     *   BreakIterator breakIterator = BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(locale);
     *   String result = UCharacter.toTitleCase(locale,
     *       source, breakIterator, UCharacter.TITLECASE_NO_LOWERCASE);
     * }}
     *
     * <p>That also means creating a BreakIterator for each locale. Expensive...</p>
     *
     * @param str the string to sentence-case.
     * @param locale the locale used for the case conversion.
     * @return the string converted to sentence-case.
