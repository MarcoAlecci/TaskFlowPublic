     * Match this filter against an Intent's data (type, scheme and path). If
     * the filter does not specify any types and does not specify any
     * schemes/paths, the match will only succeed if the intent does not
     * also specify a type or data.  If the filter does not specify any schemes,
     * it will implicitly match intents with no scheme, or the schemes "content:"
     * or "file:" (basically performing a MIME-type only match).  If the filter
     * does not specify any MIME types, the Intent also must not specify a MIME
     * type.
     *
     * <p>Be aware that to match against an authority, you must also specify a base
     * scheme the authority is in.  To match against a data path, both a scheme
     * and authority must be specified.  If the filter does not specify any
     * types or schemes that it matches against, it is considered to be empty
     * (any authority or data path given is ignored, as if it were empty as
     * well).
     *
     * <p><em>Note: MIME type, Uri scheme, and host name matching in the
     * Android framework is case-sensitive, unlike the formal RFC definitions.
     * As a result, you should always write these elements with lower case letters,
     * and normalize any MIME types or Uris you receive from
     * outside of Android to ensure these elements are lower case before
     * supplying them here.</em></p>
     *
     * @param type The desired data type to look for, as returned by
     *             Intent.resolveType().
     * @param scheme The desired data scheme to look for, as returned by
     *               Intent.getScheme().
     * @param data The full data string to match against, as supplied in
     *             Intent.data.
     *
     * @return Returns either a valid match constant (a combination of
     * {@link #MATCH_CATEGORY_MASK} and {@link #MATCH_ADJUSTMENT_MASK}),
     * or one of the error codes {@link #NO_MATCH_TYPE} if the type didn't match
     * or {@link #NO_MATCH_DATA} if the scheme/path didn't match.
