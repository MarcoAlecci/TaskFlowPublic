     * Call this to try to give focus to a specific view or to one of its
     * descendants and give it a hint about what direction focus is heading.
     *
     * A view will not actually take focus if it is not focusable ({@link #isFocusable} returns
     * false), or if it is focusable and it is not focusable in touch mode
     * ({@link #isFocusableInTouchMode}) while the device is in touch mode.
     *
     * See also {@link #focusSearch(int)}, which is what you call to say that you
     * have focus, and you want your parent to look for the next one.
     *
     * This is equivalent to calling {@link #requestFocus(int, Rect)} with
     * <code>null</code> set for the previously focused rectangle.
     *
     * @param direction One of FOCUS_UP, FOCUS_DOWN, FOCUS_LEFT, and FOCUS_RIGHT
     * @return Whether this view or one of its descendants actually took focus.
