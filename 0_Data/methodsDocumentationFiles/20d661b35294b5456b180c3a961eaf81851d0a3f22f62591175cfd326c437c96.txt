     * Constructs a stream that writes bytes to the given channel.
     *
     * <p> The <tt>write</tt> methods of the resulting stream will throw an
     * {@link IllegalBlockingModeException} if invoked while the underlying
     * channel is in non-blocking mode.  The stream will not be buffered.  The
     * stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads.  Closing
     * the stream will in turn cause the channel to be closed.  </p>
     *
     * @param  ch
     *         The channel to which bytes will be written
     *
     * @return  A new output stream
