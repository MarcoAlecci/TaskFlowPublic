     * Adds a new conference call. When a conference call is created either as a result of an
     * explicit request via {@link #onConference} or otherwise, the connection service should supply
     * an instance of {@link Conference} by invoking this method. A conference call provided by this
     * method will persist until {@link Conference#destroy} is invoked on the conference instance.
     *
     * @param conference The new conference object.
