     * Sets an additional audio output device delay in milliseconds.
     *
     * The additional output delay is a request to the output device to
     * delay audio presentation (generally with respect to video presentation for better
     * synchronization).
     * It may not be supported by all output devices,
     * and typically increases the audio latency by the amount of additional
     * audio delay requested.
     *
     * If additional audio delay is supported by an audio output device,
     * it is expected to be supported for all output streams (and configurations)
     * opened on that device.
     *
     * @param device an instance of {@link AudioDeviceInfo} returned from {@link getDevices()}.
     * @param delayMillis delay in milliseconds desired.  This should be in range of {@code 0}
     *     to the value returned by {@link #getMaxAdditionalOutputDeviceDelay()}.
     * @return true if successful, false if the device does not support output device delay
     *     or the delay is not in range of {@link #getMaxAdditionalOutputDeviceDelay()}.
