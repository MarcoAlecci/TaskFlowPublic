     * Obtains a Bundle of arbitrary data associated with this
     * event, lazily creating it if necessary. Set this value by calling
     * {@link #setData(Bundle)}.  Note that when transferring data across
     * processes via {@link Messenger}, you will need to set your ClassLoader
     * on the Bundle via {@link Bundle#setClassLoader(ClassLoader)
     * Bundle.setClassLoader()} so that it can instantiate your objects when
     * you retrieve them.
