     * Called when a virtual view that supports autofill is entered.
     *
     * <p>The virtual view boundaries must be absolute screen coordinates. For example, if the
     * parent, non-virtual view uses {@code bounds} to draw the virtual view inside its Canvas,
     * the absolute bounds could be calculated by:
     *
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     *   int offset[] = new int[2];
     *   getLocationOnScreen(offset);
     *   Rect absBounds = new Rect(bounds.left + offset[0],
     *       bounds.top + offset[1],
     *       bounds.right + offset[0], bounds.bottom + offset[1]);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param view the virtual view parent.
     * @param virtualId id identifying the virtual child inside the parent view.
     * @param absBounds absolute boundaries of the virtual view in the screen.
