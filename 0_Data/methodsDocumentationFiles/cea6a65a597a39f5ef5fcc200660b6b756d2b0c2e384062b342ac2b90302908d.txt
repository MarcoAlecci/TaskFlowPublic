     * The application is being asked to write any data changed since the last
     * time it performed a backup operation. The state data recorded during the
     * last backup pass is provided in the <code>oldState</code> file
     * descriptor. If <code>oldState</code> is <code>null</code>, no old state
     * is available and the application should perform a full backup. In both
     * cases, a representation of the final backup state after this pass should
     * be written to the file pointed to by the file descriptor wrapped in
     * <code>newState</code>.
     * <p>
     * Each entity written to the {@link android.app.backup.BackupDataOutput}
     * <code>data</code> stream will be transmitted
     * over the current backup transport and stored in the remote data set under
     * the key supplied as part of the entity.  Writing an entity with a negative
     * data size instructs the transport to delete whatever entity currently exists
     * under that key from the remote data set.
     *
     * @param oldState An open, read-only ParcelFileDescriptor pointing to the
     *            last backup state provided by the application. May be
     *            <code>null</code>, in which case no prior state is being
     *            provided and the application should perform a full backup.
     * @param data A structured wrapper around an open, read/write
     *            file descriptor pointing to the backup data destination.
     *            Typically the application will use backup helper classes to
     *            write to this file.
     * @param newState An open, read/write ParcelFileDescriptor pointing to an
     *            empty file. The application should record the final backup
     *            state here after writing the requested data to the <code>data</code>
     *            output stream.
