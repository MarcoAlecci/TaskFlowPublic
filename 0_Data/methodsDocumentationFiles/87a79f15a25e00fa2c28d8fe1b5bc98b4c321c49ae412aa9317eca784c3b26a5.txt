     * <p>Handles scrolling in response to a "page up/down" shortcut press. This
     * method will scroll the view by one page left or right and give the focus
     * to the leftmost/rightmost component in the new visible area. If no
     * component is a good candidate for focus, this scrollview reclaims the
     * focus.</p>
     *
     * @param direction the scroll direction: {@link android.view.View#FOCUS_LEFT}
     *                  to go one page left or {@link android.view.View#FOCUS_RIGHT}
     *                  to go one page right
     * @return true if the key event is consumed by this method, false otherwise
