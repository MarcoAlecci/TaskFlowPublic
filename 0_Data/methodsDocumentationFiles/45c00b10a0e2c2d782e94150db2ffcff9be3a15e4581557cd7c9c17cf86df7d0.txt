     * @implSpec
     * This implementation returns a collection that subclasses {@link
     * AbstractCollection}.  The subclass's iterator method returns a
     * "wrapper object" over this map's <tt>entrySet()</tt> iterator.
     * The <tt>size</tt> method delegates to this map's <tt>size</tt>
     * method and the <tt>contains</tt> method delegates to this map's
     * <tt>containsValue</tt> method.
     *
     * <p>The collection is created the first time this method is called, and
     * returned in response to all subsequent calls.  No synchronization is
     * performed, so there is a slight chance that multiple calls to this
     * method will not all return the same collection.
