     * Request that keepalives be started on a IPsec NAT-T socket file descriptor. Directly called
     * by system apps which don't use IpSecService to create {@link UdpEncapsulationSocket}.
     *
     * @param network The {@link Network} the socket is on.
     * @param pfd The {@link ParcelFileDescriptor} that needs to be kept alive. The provided
     *        {@link ParcelFileDescriptor} must be bound to a port and the keepalives will be sent
     *        from that port.
     * @param source The source address of the {@link UdpEncapsulationSocket}.
     * @param destination The destination address of the {@link UdpEncapsulationSocket}. The
     *        keepalive packets will always be sent to port 4500 of the given {@code destination}.
     * @param executor The executor on which callback will be invoked. The provided {@link Executor}
     *                 must run callback sequentially, otherwise the order of callbacks cannot be
     *                 guaranteed.
     * @param callback A {@link SocketKeepalive.Callback}. Used for notifications about keepalive
     *        changes. Must be extended by applications that use this API.
     *
     * @return A {@link SocketKeepalive} object that can be used to control the keepalive on the
     *         given socket.
