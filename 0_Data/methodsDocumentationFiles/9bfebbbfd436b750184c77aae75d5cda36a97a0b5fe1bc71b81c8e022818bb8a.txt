     * The calling device admin must have requested {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_WIPE_DATA} to

     * If the caller is a profile owner of an organization-owned managed profile, it may
     * additionally call this method on the parent instance.
     * Calling this method on the parent {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance would wipe the
     * entire device, while calling it on the current profile instance would relinquish the device
     * for personal use, removing the managed profile and all policies set by the profile owner.
