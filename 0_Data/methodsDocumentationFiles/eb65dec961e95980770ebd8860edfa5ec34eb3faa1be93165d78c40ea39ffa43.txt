         * Default implementation of
         * {@link android.view.KeyEvent.Callback#onKeyMultiple(int, int, KeyEvent)
         * KeyEvent.Callback.onKeyMultiple()}: always returns false (doesn't handle the event).
         *
         * <p>Override this to intercept special key multiple events before they are processed by
         * the application. If you return true, the application will not itself process the event.
         * If you return false, the normal application processing will occur as if the TV input had
         * not seen the event at all.
         *
         * @param keyCode The value in event.getKeyCode().
         * @param count The number of times the action was made.
         * @param event Description of the key event.
         * @return If you handled the event, return {@code true}. If you want to allow the event to
         *         be handled by the next receiver, return {@code false}.
