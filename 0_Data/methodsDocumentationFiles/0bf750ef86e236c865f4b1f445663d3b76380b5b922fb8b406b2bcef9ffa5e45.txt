     * Create a new NDEF Record containing a URI.<p>
     * Use this method to encode a URI (or URL) into an NDEF Record.<p>
     * Uses the well known URI type representation: {@link #TNF_WELL_KNOWN}
     * and {@link #RTD_URI}. This is the most efficient encoding
     * of a URI into NDEF.<p>
     * The uri parameter will be normalized with
     * {@link Uri#normalizeScheme} to set the scheme to lower case to
     * follow Android best practices for intent filtering.
     * However the unchecked exception
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException} may be thrown if the uri
     * parameter has serious problems, for example if it is empty, so always
     * catch this exception if you are passing user-generated data into this
     * method.<p>
     *

     * @param uri URI to encode.
     * @return an NDEF Record containing the URI
     * @throws IllegalArugmentException if the uri is empty or invalid
