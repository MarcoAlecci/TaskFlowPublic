     * Sets the TextView to display the specified slice of the specified
     * char array. You must promise that you will not change the contents
     * of the array except for right before another call to setText(),
     * since the TextView has no way to know that the text
     * has changed and that it needs to invalidate and re-layout.
     *
     * @param text char array to be displayed
     * @param start start index in the char array
     * @param len length of char count after {@code start}
