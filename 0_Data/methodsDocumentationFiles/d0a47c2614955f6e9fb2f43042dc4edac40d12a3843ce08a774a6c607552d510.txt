     * Override this to handle requests to insert a set of new rows, or the
     * default implementation will iterate over the values and call
     * {@link #insert} on each of them.
     * As a courtesy, call {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(android.net.Uri ,android.database.ContentObserver) notifyChange()}
     * after inserting.
     * This method can be called from multiple threads, as described in
     * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     *
     * @param uri The content:// URI of the insertion request.
     * @param values An array of sets of column_name/value pairs to add to the database.
     *    This must not be {@code null}.
     * @return The number of values that were inserted.
