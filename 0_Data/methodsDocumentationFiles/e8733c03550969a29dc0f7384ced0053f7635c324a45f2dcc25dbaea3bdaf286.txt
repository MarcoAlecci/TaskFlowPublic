     * Return the approximate per-application memory class of the current
     * device when an application is running with a large heap.  This is the
     * space available for memory-intensive applications; most applications
     * should not need this amount of memory, and should instead stay with the
     * {@link #getMemoryClass()} limit.  The returned value is in megabytes.
     * This may be the same size as {@link #getMemoryClass()} on memory
     * constrained devices, or it may be significantly larger on devices with
     * a large amount of available RAM.
     *
     * <p>This is the size of the application's Dalvik heap if it has
     * specified <code>android:largeHeap="true"</code> in its manifest.
