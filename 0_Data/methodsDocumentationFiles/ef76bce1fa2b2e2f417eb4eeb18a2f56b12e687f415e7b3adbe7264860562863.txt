     * may continue to exist on-screen as long as its parent continues
     * to exist. To explicitly remove a surface from the screen use
     * {@link Transaction#reparent} with a null-parent. After release,
     * {@link #isValid} will return false and other methods will throw
     * an exception.
     *
     * Always call release() when you're done with a SurfaceControl.
