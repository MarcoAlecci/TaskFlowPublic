     * Sets the flag indicating that this receiver should abort the
     * current broadcast; only works with broadcasts sent through
     * {@link Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)
     * Context.sendOrderedBroadcast}.  This will prevent
     * any other broadcast receivers from receiving the broadcast. It will still
     * call {@link #onReceive} of the BroadcastReceiver that the caller of
     * {@link Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)
     * Context.sendOrderedBroadcast} passed in.
     *
     * <p><strong>This method does not work with non-ordered broadcasts such
     * as those sent with {@link Context#sendBroadcast(Intent)
     * Context.sendBroadcast}</strong></p>
