         * Returns whether this LayoutManager supports automatic item animations.
         * A LayoutManager wishing to support item animations should obey certain
         * rules as outlined in {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, State)}.
         * The default return value is <code>false</code>, so subclasses of LayoutManager
         * will not get predictive item animations by default.
         *
         * <p>Whether item animations are enabled in a RecyclerView is determined both
         * by the return value from this method and the
         * {@link RecyclerView#setItemAnimator(ItemAnimator) ItemAnimator} set on the
         * RecyclerView itself. If the RecyclerView has a non-null ItemAnimator but this
         * method returns false, then simple item animations will be enabled, in which
         * views that are moving onto or off of the screen are simply faded in/out. If
         * the RecyclerView has a non-null ItemAnimator and this method returns true,
         * then there will be two calls to {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, State)} to
         * setup up the information needed to more intelligently predict where appearing
         * and disappearing views should be animated from/to.</p>
         *
         * @return true if predictive item animations should be enabled, false otherwise
