     * Creates a linear spline from a given set of control points.
     *
     * Like a monotone cubic spline, the interpolated curve will be monotonic if the control points
     * are monotonic.
     *
     * @param x The X component of the control points, strictly increasing.
     * @param y The Y component of the control points.
     * @return
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the X or Y arrays are null, have
     * different lengths or have fewer than 2 values.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the X components of the control points are not strictly
     * increasing.
