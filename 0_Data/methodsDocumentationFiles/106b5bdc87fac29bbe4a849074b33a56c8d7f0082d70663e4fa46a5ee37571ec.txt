     * Sets playback rate using {@link PlaybackParams}.
     * <p>
     * When using MediaSync with {@link AudioTrack}, set playback params using this
     * call instead of calling it directly on the track, so that the sync is aware of
     * the params change.
     * <p>
     * This call also works if there is no audio track.
     *
     * @param params the playback params to use. {@link PlaybackParams#getSpeed
     *     Speed} is the ratio between desired playback rate and normal one. 1.0 means
     *     normal playback speed. 0.0 means pause. Value larger than 1.0 means faster playback,
     *     while value between 0.0 and 1.0 for slower playback. <b>Note:</b> the normal rate
     *     does not change as a result of this call. To restore the original rate at any time,
     *     use speed of 1.0.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the internal sync engine or the audio track has not
     *     been initialized.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the params are not supported.
