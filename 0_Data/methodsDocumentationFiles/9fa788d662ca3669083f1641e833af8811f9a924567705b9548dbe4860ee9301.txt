     * This method is called whenever the user chooses to navigate Up within your application's
     * activity hierarchy from the action bar.
     *
     * <p>If the attribute {@link android.R.attr#parentActivityName parentActivityName}
     * was specified in the manifest for this activity or an activity-alias to it,
     * default Up navigation will be handled automatically. If any activity
     * along the parent chain requires extra Intent arguments, the Activity subclass
     * should override the method {@link #onPrepareNavigateUpTaskStack(TaskStackBuilder)}
     * to supply those arguments.</p>
     *
     * <p>See <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack.html">Tasks and Back Stack</a>
     * from the developer guide and <a href="{@docRoot}design/patterns/navigation.html">Navigation</a>
     * from the design guide for more information about navigating within your app.</p>
     *
     * <p>See the {@link TaskStackBuilder} class and the Activity methods
     * {@link #getParentActivityIntent()}, {@link #shouldUpRecreateTask(Intent)}, and
     * {@link #navigateUpTo(Intent)} for help implementing custom Up navigation.
     * The AppNavigation sample application in the Android SDK is also available for reference.</p>
     *
     * @return true if Up navigation completed successfully and this Activity was finished,
     *         false otherwise.
