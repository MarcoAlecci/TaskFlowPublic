         * <p>Notifies the start of the animation as well as the animation's overall play direction.
         * This method's default behavior is to call {@link #onAnimationStart(Animator)}. This
         * method can be overridden, though not required, to get the additional play direction info
         * when an animation starts. Skipping calling super when overriding this method results in
         * {@link #onAnimationStart(Animator)} not getting called.
         *
         * @param animation The started animation.
         * @param isReverse Whether the animation is playing in reverse.
