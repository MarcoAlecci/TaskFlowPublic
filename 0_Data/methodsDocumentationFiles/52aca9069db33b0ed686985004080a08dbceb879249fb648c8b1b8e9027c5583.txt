     * Sets the minimum arc along the circle between two points aligned near horizontally.
     * When start and end points are close to horizontal, the calculated center point of the
     * circle will be far from both points, giving a near straight path between the points.
     * By setting a minimum angle, this forces the center point to be closer and give an
     * exaggerated curve to the path.
     * <p>The default value is 0.</p>
