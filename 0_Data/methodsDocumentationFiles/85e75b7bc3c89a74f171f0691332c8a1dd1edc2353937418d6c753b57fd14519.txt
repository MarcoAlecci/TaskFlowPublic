     * <p>Called when a account / authority pair
     * <ul>
     * <li>that can be handled by this adapter</li>
     * <li>{@link ContentResolver#requestSync(SyncRequest) is synced}</li>
     * <li>and the account/provider {@link ContentResolver#getIsSyncable(Account, String) has

     * <p>This might be called on a different service connection as {@link #onPerformSync}.
     *
     * <p>The system expects this method to immediately return. If the call stalls the system
     * behaves as if this method returned {@code true}. If it is required to perform a longer task
     * (such as interacting with the user), return {@code false} and proceed in a difference
     * context, such as an {@link android.app.Activity}, or foreground service. The sync can then be
     * rescheduled once the account becomes syncable.
     *
     * @return If {@code false} syncing is deferred. Returns {@code true} by default, i.e. by
     *         default syncing starts immediately.
