     * Destroys all the display lists associated with the current rendering content.
     * This includes releasing a reference to the current content root RenderNode. It will
     * therefore be necessary to call {@link #setContentRoot(RenderNode)} in order to resume
     * rendering after calling this, along with re-recording the display lists for the
     * RenderNode tree.
     *
     * <p>It is recommended, but not necessary, to use this in combination with lifecycle events
     * such as {@link Activity#onStop()} and {@link Activity#onStart()} or in response to
     * {@link android.content.ComponentCallbacks2#onTrimMemory(int)} signals such as
     * {@link android.content.ComponentCallbacks2#TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN}
     *
     * See also {@link #stop()}.
