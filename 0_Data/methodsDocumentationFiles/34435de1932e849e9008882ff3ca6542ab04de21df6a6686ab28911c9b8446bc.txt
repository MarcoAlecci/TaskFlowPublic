     * Wraps a long array into a buffer.
     *
     * <p> The new buffer will be backed by the given long array;
     * that is, modifications to the buffer will cause the array to be modified
     * and vice versa.  The new buffer's capacity and limit will be
     * <tt>array.length</tt>, its position will be zero, and its mark will be
     * undefined.  Its {@link #array backing array} will be the
     * given array, and its {@link #arrayOffset array offset>} will
     * be zero.  </p>
     *
     * @param  array
     *         The array that will back this buffer
     *
     * @return  The new long buffer
