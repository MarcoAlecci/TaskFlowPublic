             * Apps becoming Direct Boot aware need to carefully inspect each
             * query site and explicitly decide which combination of flags they
             * want to use:
             * <ul>
             * <li>{@link PackageManager#MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE}
             * <li>{@link PackageManager#MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE}
