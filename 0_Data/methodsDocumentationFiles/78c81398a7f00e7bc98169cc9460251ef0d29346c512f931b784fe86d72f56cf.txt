     * Gets the RF phase detected by the receiver.
     *
     * <p>Range: [0.0, 1.0].
     *
     * <p>This is the fractional part of the complete carrier phase measurement.
     *
     * <p>The reference frequency is given by the value of {@link #getCarrierFrequencyHz()}.
     *
     * <p>The error estimate for this value is {@link #getCarrierPhaseUncertainty()}.
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasCarrierPhase()} is {@code true}.
     *
     * @deprecated use {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeMeters()} instead.
