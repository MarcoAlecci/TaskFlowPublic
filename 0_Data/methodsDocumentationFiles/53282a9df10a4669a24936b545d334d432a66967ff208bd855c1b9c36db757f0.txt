         * <p>Messages should be added as historic if they are not the main subject of the
         * notification but may give context to a conversation. The system may choose to present
         * them only when relevant, e.g. when replying to a message through a {@link RemoteInput}.
         *
         * <p>The messages should be added in chronologic order, i.e. the oldest first,
         * the newest last.
         *
         * @param message The historic {@link Message} to be added
         * @return this object for method chaining
