     * Initializes this key agreement with the given key, set of
     * algorithm parameters, and source of randomness.
     *
     * @param key the party's private information. For example, in the case
     * of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, this would be the party's own
     * Diffie-Hellman private key.
     * @param params the key agreement parameters
     * @param random the source of randomness
     *
     * @exception InvalidKeyException if the given key is
     * inappropriate for this key agreement, e.g., is of the wrong type or
     * has an incompatible algorithm type.
     * @exception InvalidAlgorithmParameterException if the given parameters
     * are inappropriate for this key agreement.
