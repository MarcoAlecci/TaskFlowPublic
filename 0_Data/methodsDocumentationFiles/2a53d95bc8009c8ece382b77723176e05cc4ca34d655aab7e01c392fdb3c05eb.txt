         * <p>
         * The position must be in ms and indicates the current playback
         * position within the item. If the position is unknown use
         * {@link #PLAYBACK_POSITION_UNKNOWN}. When not using an unknown
         * position the time at which the position was updated must be provided.
         * It is okay to use {@link SystemClock#elapsedRealtime()} if the
         * current position was just retrieved.
         * <p>
         * The speed is a multiple of normal playback and should be 0 when
         * paused and negative when rewinding. Normal playback speed is 1.0.
         * <p>
         * The state must be one of the following:
         * <ul>
         * <li> {@link PlaybackState#STATE_NONE}</li>
         * <li> {@link PlaybackState#STATE_STOPPED}</li>
         * <li> {@link PlaybackState#STATE_PLAYING}</li>
         * <li> {@link PlaybackState#STATE_PAUSED}</li>

         *            timebase that the position was updated at.
