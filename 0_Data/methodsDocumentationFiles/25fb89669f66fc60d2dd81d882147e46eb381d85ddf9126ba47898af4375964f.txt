     * Legacy API, DO NOT USE: Only deals with flat UIDs and tags. No chains are transferred, and no
     * differences in chains are returned. This will be removed once its callers have been
     * rewritten.
     *
     * NOTE: This is currently only used in GnssLocationProvider.

     * @hide
     * @deprecated for internal use only. WorkSources are opaque and no external callers should need
     *     to be aware of internal differences.
