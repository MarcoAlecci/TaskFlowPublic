         * Called by the ItemTouchHelper when user action finished on a ViewHolder and now the View
         * will be animated to its final position.
         * <p>
         * Default implementation uses ItemAnimator's duration values. If
         * <code>animationType</code> is {@link #ANIMATION_TYPE_DRAG}, it returns
         * {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator#getMoveDuration()}, otherwise, it returns
         * {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator#getRemoveDuration()}. If RecyclerView does not have
         * any {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator} attached, this method returns
         * {@code DEFAULT_DRAG_ANIMATION_DURATION} or {@code DEFAULT_SWIPE_ANIMATION_DURATION}
         * depending on the animation type.
         *
         * @param recyclerView  The RecyclerView to which the ItemTouchHelper is attached to.
         * @param animationType The type of animation. Is one of {@link #ANIMATION_TYPE_DRAG},
         *                      {@link #ANIMATION_TYPE_SWIPE_CANCEL} or
         *                      {@link #ANIMATION_TYPE_SWIPE_SUCCESS}.
         * @param animateDx     The horizontal distance that the animation will offset
         * @param animateDy     The vertical distance that the animation will offset
         * @return The duration for the animation
