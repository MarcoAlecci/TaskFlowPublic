     * <p>
     * This method is only accessible to the following narrow set of apps:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The carrier app for this subscriberId, as determined by
     * {@link TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges()}.
     * <li>The carrier app explicitly delegated access through
     * {@link CarrierConfigManager#KEY_CONFIG_PLANS_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_STRING}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param subId the subscriber this relationship applies to. An empty list
     *            may be sent to clear any existing plans.
     * @param plans the list of plans. The first plan is always the primary and
     *            most important plan. Any additional plans are secondary and
     *            may not be displayed or used by decision making logic.
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller doesn't meet the requirements
     *             outlined above.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if plans don't meet the requirements
     *             defined in {@link SubscriptionPlan}.
