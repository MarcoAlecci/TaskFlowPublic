     * Sets the id of a view after which this one is visited in accessibility traversal.
     * A screen-reader must visit the content of the other view before the content of this
     * one. For example, if view B is set to be after view A, then a screen-reader
     * will traverse the entire content of A before traversing the entire content of B,
     * regardles of what traversal strategy it is using.
     * <p>
     * Views that do not have specified before/after relationships are traversed in order
     * determined by the screen-reader.

     * <p>
     * Setting that this view is after a view that is not important for accessibility
     * or if this view is not important for accessibility will have no effect as the
     * screen-reader is not aware of unimportant views.
