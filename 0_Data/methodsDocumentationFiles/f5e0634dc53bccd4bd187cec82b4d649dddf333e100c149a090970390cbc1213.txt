     * Asks StorageManager to fixup the permissions of an application-private directory.
     *
     * On devices without sdcardfs, filesystem permissions aren't magically fixed up. This
     * is problematic mostly in application-private directories, which are owned by the
     * application itself; if another process with elevated permissions creates a file
     * in these directories, the UID will be wrong, and the owning package won't be able
     * to access the files.
     *
     * This API can be used to recursively fix up the permissions on the passed in path.
     * The default platform user of this API is the DownloadProvider, which can download
     * things in application-private directories on their behalf.
     *
     * This API doesn't require any special permissions, because it merely changes the
     * permissions of a directory to what they should anyway be.
