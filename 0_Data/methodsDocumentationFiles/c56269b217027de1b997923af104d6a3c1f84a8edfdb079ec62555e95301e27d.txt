     * Sets the listener to be invoked when a subtitle track has new data available.
     * The subtitle data comes from a subtitle track previously selected with
     * {@link #selectTrack(int)}. Use {@link #getTrackInfo()} to determine which tracks are
     * subtitles (of type {@link TrackInfo#MEDIA_TRACK_TYPE_SUBTITLE}), Subtitle track encodings
     * can be determined by {@link TrackInfo#getFormat()}).<br>
     * See {@link SubtitleData} for an example of querying subtitle encoding.<br>
     * The listener will be called on the same thread as the one in which the MediaPlayer was
     * created.
     * @param listener the listener called when new data is available
