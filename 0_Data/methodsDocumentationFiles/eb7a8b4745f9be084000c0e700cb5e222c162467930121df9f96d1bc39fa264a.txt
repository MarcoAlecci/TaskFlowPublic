         * Request that the player prepare playback for a specific search query. An empty or null
         * query should be treated as a request to prepare any music. In other words, other sessions
         * can continue to play during the preparation of this session. This method can be used to
         * speed up the start of the playback. Once the preparation is done, the session will
         * change its playback state to {@link PlaybackState#STATE_PAUSED}. Afterwards,
         * {@link #play} can be called to start playback. If the preparation is not needed,
         * {@link #playFromSearch} can be directly called without this method.
         *
         * @param query The search query.
         * @param extras Optional extras that can include extra information
         *               about the query.
