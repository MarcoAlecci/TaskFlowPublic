         * Creates a new Drawable instance from its constant state using the
         * specified resources and theme. This method should be implemented for
         * drawables that have theme-dependent properties.
         * <p>
         * The default implementation for this method calls through to
         * {@link #newDrawable(Resources)}.
         *
         * @param res the resources of the context in which the drawable will
         *            be displayed
         * @param theme the theme of the context in which the drawable will be
         *              displayed
         * @return a new drawable object based on this constant state
