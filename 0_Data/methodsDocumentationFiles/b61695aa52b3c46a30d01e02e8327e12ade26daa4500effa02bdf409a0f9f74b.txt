         * Array representing corrections on a spherical mapping. Corrections are added to
         * measurements to obtain the corrected values.
         *
         * Each row (major indices) represents a fixed theta. The first row corresponds to a
         * theta angle of 0 degrees. The last row corresponds to a theta angle of (360 - deltaTheta)
         * degrees, where deltaTheta is the regular spacing between azimuthal angles, i.e.,
         * deltaTheta = 360 / (number of rows).
         *
         * The columns (minor indices) represent fixed zenith angles, beginning at 0 degrees and
         * ending at 180 degrees. They are separated by deltaPhi, the regular spacing between zenith
         * angles, i.e., deltaPhi = 180 / (number of columns - 1).
