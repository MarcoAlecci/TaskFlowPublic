     * Skips the specified number of characters in the stream. Returns
     * the number of characters that were skipped.
     *
     * <p>The <code>ns</code> parameter may be negative, even though the
     * <code>skip</code> method of the {@link Reader} superclass throws
     * an exception in this case. Negative values of <code>ns</code> cause the
     * stream to skip backwards. Negative return values indicate a skip
     * backwards. It is not possible to skip backwards past the beginning of
     * the string.
     *
     * <p>If the entire string has been read or skipped, then this method has
     * no effect and always returns 0.
     *
     * @exception  IOException  If an I/O error occurs
