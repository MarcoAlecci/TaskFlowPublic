     * Returns a Drawable that can be used to draw the image inside this Icon, constructing it
     * if necessary. Depending on the type of image, this may not be something you want to do on
     * the UI thread, so consider using
     * {@link #loadDrawableAsync(Context, Message) loadDrawableAsync} instead.
     *
     * @param context {@link android.content.Context Context} in which to load the drawable; used
     *                to access {@link android.content.res.Resources Resources}, for example.
     * @return A fresh instance of a drawable for this image, yours to keep.
