     * Must be called by the agent to indicate this network was manually selected by the user.
     * This should be called before the NetworkInfo is marked CONNECTED so that this
     * Network can be given special treatment at that time. If {@code acceptUnvalidated} is
     * {@code true}, then the system will switch to this network. If it is {@code false} and the
     * network cannot be validated, the system will ask the user whether to switch to this network.
     * If the user confirms and selects "don't ask again", then the system will call
     * {@link #saveAcceptUnvalidated} to persist the user's choice. Thus, if the transport ever
     * calls this method with {@code acceptUnvalidated} set to {@code false}, it must also implement
     * {@link #saveAcceptUnvalidated} to respect the user's choice.
     * @hide should move to NetworkAgentConfig.
