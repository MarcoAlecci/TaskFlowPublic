     * Add packets' PID to the descrambler for descrambling.
     *
     * The descrambler will start descrambling packets with this PID. Multiple PIDs can be added
     * into one descrambler instance because descambling can happen simultaneously on packets
     * from different PIDs.
     *
     * If the Descrambler previously contained a filter for the PID, the old filter is replaced
     * by the specified filter.
     *
     * @param pidType the type of the PID.
     * @param pid the PID of packets to start to be descrambled.
     * @param filter an optional filter instance to identify upper stream.
     * @return result status of the operation.
