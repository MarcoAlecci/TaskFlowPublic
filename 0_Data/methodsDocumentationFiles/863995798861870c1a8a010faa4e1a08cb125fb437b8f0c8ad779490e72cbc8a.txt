     * Create a typeface object given a font request. The font will be asynchronously fetched,
     * therefore the result is delivered to the given callback. See {@link FontRequest}.
     * Only one of the methods in callback will be invoked, depending on whether the request
     * succeeds or fails. These calls will happen on the caller thread.
     *
     * Note that the result Typeface may be cached internally and the same instance will be returned
     * the next time you call this method with the same request. If you want to bypass this cache,
     * use {@link #fetchFonts} and {@link #buildTypeface} instead.
     *
     * @param context A context to be used for fetching from font provider.
     * @param request A {@link FontRequest} object that identifies the provider and query for the
     *                request. May not be null.
     * @param handler A handler to be processed the font fetching.
     * @param cancellationSignal A signal to cancel the operation in progress, or null if none. If
     *                           the operation is canceled, then {@link
     *                           android.os.OperationCanceledException} will be thrown.
     * @param callback A callback that will be triggered when results are obtained. May not be null.
