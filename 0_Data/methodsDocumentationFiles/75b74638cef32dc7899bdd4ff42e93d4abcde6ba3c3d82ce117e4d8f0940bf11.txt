     * Helper for getFlags(), returning true if DITHER_FLAG bit is set
     * Dithering affects how colors that are higher precision than the device
     * are down-sampled. No dithering is generally faster, but higher precision
     * colors are just truncated down (e.g. 8888 -> 565). Dithering tries to
     * distribute the error inherent in this process, to reduce the visual
     * artifacts.
     *
     * @return true if the dithering bit is set in the paint's flags.
