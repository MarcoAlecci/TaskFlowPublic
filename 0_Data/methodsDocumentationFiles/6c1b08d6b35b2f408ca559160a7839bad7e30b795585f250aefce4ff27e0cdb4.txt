     * Query the given URL, returning a {@link Cursor} over the result set.
     *
     * @param distinct true if you want each row to be unique, false otherwise.
     * @param table The table name to compile the query against.
     * @param columns A list of which columns to return. Passing null will
     *            return all columns, which is discouraged to prevent reading
     *            data from storage that isn't going to be used.
     * @param selection A filter declaring which rows to return, formatted as an
     *            SQL WHERE clause (excluding the WHERE itself). Passing null
     *            will return all rows for the given table.
     * @param selectionArgs You may include ?s in selection, which will be
     *         replaced by the values from selectionArgs, in order that they
     *         appear in the selection. The values will be bound as Strings.
     * @param groupBy A filter declaring how to group rows, formatted as an SQL
     *            GROUP BY clause (excluding the GROUP BY itself). Passing null
     *            will cause the rows to not be grouped.
     * @param having A filter declare which row groups to include in the cursor,
     *            if row grouping is being used, formatted as an SQL HAVING
     *            clause (excluding the HAVING itself). Passing null will cause
     *            all row groups to be included, and is required when row
     *            grouping is not being used.
     * @param orderBy How to order the rows, formatted as an SQL ORDER BY clause
     *            (excluding the ORDER BY itself). Passing null will use the
     *            default sort order, which may be unordered.
     * @param limit Limits the number of rows returned by the query,
     *            formatted as LIMIT clause. Passing null denotes no LIMIT clause.
     * @param cancellationSignal A signal to cancel the operation in progress, or null if none.
     * If the operation is canceled, then {@link OperationCanceledException} will be thrown
     * when the query is executed.
     * @return A {@link Cursor} object, which is positioned before the first entry. Note that
     * {@link Cursor}s are not synchronized, see the documentation for more details.
