     * Sets the side that is used to calculate the transition propagation. If the transitioning
     * View is visible in the start of the transition, then it will transition sooner when
     * closer to the side and later when farther. If the view is not visible in the start of
     * the transition, then it will transition later when closer to the side and sooner when
     * farther from the edge. The default is {@link Gravity#BOTTOM}.
     *
     * @param side The side that is used to calculate the transition propagation. Must be one of
     *             {@link Gravity#LEFT}, {@link Gravity#TOP}, {@link Gravity#RIGHT},
     *             {@link Gravity#BOTTOM}, {@link Gravity#START}, or {@link Gravity#END}.
