     *  Specify the number of times to repeat the animation.
     *
     *  <p>By default, the repeat count in the encoded data is respected. If set
     *  to {@link #REPEAT_INFINITE}, the animation will repeat as long as it is
     *  displayed. If the value is {@code 0}, the animation will play once.</p>
     *
     *  <p>This call replaces the current repeat count. If the encoded data
     *  specified a repeat count of {@code 2} (meaning that
     *  {@link #getRepeatCount()} returns {@code 2}, the animation will play
     *  three times. Calling {@code setRepeatCount(1)} will result in playing only
     *  twice and {@link #getRepeatCount()} returning {@code 1}.</p>
     *
     *  <p>If the animation is already playing, the iterations that have already
     *  occurred count towards the new count. If the animation has already
     *  repeated the appropriate number of times (or more), it will finish its
     *  current iteration and then stop.</p>
