     * May throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException}
     *
     * If {@link #setTempFileRootDirectory(File)} has not called after the app has been installed,
     * this method will create a directory at the default location defined at
     * {@link MbmsDownloadSession#DEFAULT_TOP_LEVEL_TEMP_DIRECTORY} and store that as the temp
     * file root directory.
     *
     * If the {@link DownloadRequest} has a destination that is not on the same filesystem as the
     * temp file directory provided via {@link #getTempFileRootDirectory()}, an
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown.
     *
     * Asynchronous errors through the callback may include any error not specific to the
     * streaming use-case.
     *
     * If no error is delivered via the callback after calling this method, that means that the
     * middleware has successfully started the download or scheduled the download, if the download
     * is at a future time.
     * @param request The request that specifies what should be downloaded.
