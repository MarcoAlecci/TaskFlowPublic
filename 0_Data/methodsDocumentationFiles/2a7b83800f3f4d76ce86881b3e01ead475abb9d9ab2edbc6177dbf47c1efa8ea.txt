     * Displays the content view in a popup window anchored to the corner of
     * another view. The window is positioned according to the specified
     * gravity and offset by the specified x and y coordinates.
     * <p>
     * If there is not enough room on screen to show the popup in its entirety,
     * this method tries to find a parent scroll view to scroll. If no parent
     * view can be scrolled, the specified vertical gravity will be ignored and
     * the popup will anchor itself such that it is visible.
     * <p>
     * If the view later scrolls to move <code>anchor</code> to a different
     * location, the popup will be moved correspondingly.
