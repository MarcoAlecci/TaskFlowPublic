     * Attempts to skip over {@code n} bytes of input discarding the
     * skipped bytes.
     * <p>
     *
     * This method may skip over some smaller number of bytes, possibly zero.
     * This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of
     * file before {@code n} bytes have been skipped is only one
     * possibility. This method never throws an {@code EOFException}.
     * The actual number of bytes skipped is returned.  If {@code n}
     * is negative, no bytes are skipped.
     *
     * @param      n   the number of bytes to be skipped.
     * @return     the actual number of bytes skipped.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
