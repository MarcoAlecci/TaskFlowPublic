     * @deprecated Sticky broadcasts should not be used.  They provide no security (anyone
     * can access them), no protection (anyone can modify them), and many other problems.
     * The recommended pattern is to use a non-sticky broadcast to report that <em>something</em>
     * has changed, with another mechanism for apps to retrieve the current value whenever
     * desired.
     *
     * @param intent The Intent that was previously broadcast.
