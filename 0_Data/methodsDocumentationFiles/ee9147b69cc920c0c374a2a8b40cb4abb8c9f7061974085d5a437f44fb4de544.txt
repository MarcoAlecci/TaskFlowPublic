     * Compute the current velocity based on the points that have been
     * collected.  Only call this when you actually want to retrieve velocity
     * information, as it is relatively expensive.  You can then retrieve
     * the velocity with {@link #getXVelocity()} and
     * {@link #getYVelocity()}.
     * 
     * @param units The units you would like the velocity in.  A value of 1
     * provides pixels per millisecond, 1000 provides pixels per second, etc.
     * @param maxVelocity The maximum velocity that can be computed by this method.
     * This value must be declared in the same unit as the units parameter. This value
     * must be positive.
