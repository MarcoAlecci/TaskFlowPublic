     * Attaches an auxiliary effect to the audio track. A typical auxiliary
     * effect is a reverberation effect which can be applied on any sound source
     * that directs a certain amount of its energy to this effect. This amount
     * is defined by setAuxEffectSendLevel().
     * {@see #setAuxEffectSendLevel(float)}.
     * <p>After creating an auxiliary effect (e.g.
     * {@link android.media.audiofx.EnvironmentalReverb}), retrieve its ID with
     * {@link android.media.audiofx.AudioEffect#getId()} and use it when calling
     * this method to attach the audio track to the effect.
     * <p>To detach the effect from the audio track, call this method with a
     * null effect id.
     *
     * @param effectId system wide unique id of the effect to attach
     * @return error code or success, see {@link #SUCCESS},
     *    {@link #ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION}, {@link #ERROR_BAD_VALUE}
