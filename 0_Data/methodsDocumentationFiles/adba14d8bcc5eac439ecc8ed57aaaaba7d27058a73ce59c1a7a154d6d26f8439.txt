     * Returns the client session context, which represents the set of
     * SSL sessions available for use during the handshake phase of
     * client-side SSL sockets.
     * <P>
     * This context may be unavailable in some environments, in which
     * case this method returns null. For example, when the underlying
     * SSL provider does not provide an implementation of SSLSessionContext
     * interface, this method returns null. A non-null session context
     * is returned otherwise.
