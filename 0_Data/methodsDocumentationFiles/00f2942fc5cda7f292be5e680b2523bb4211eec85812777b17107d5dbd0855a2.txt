         * Sets the allowable set of IPsec algorithms
         *
         * <p>If set, this will constrain the set of algorithms that the IPsec tunnel will use for
         * integrity verification and encryption to the provided list.
         *
         * <p>The set of allowed IPsec algorithms is defined in {@link IpSecAlgorithm}. Adding of
         * algorithms that are considered insecure (such as AUTH_HMAC_MD5 and AUTH_HMAC_SHA1) is not
         * permitted, and will result in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown.
         *
         * <p>The provided algorithm list must contain at least one algorithm that provides
         * Authentication, and one that provides Encryption. Authenticated Encryption with
         * Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms provide both Authentication and Encryption.
         *
         * <p>By default, this profile will use any algorithm defined in {@link IpSecAlgorithm},
         * with the exception of those considered insecure (as described above).
