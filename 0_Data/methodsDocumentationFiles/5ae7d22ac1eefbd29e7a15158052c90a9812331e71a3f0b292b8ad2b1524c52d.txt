     * Get a predefined vibration effect.
     *
     * Predefined effects are a set of common vibration effects that should be identical, regardless
     * of the app they come from, in order to provide a cohesive experience for users across
     * the entire device. They also may be custom tailored to the device hardware in order to
     * provide a better experience than you could otherwise build using the generic building
     * blocks.
     *
     * Some effects you may only want to play if there's a hardware specific implementation because
     * they may, for example, be too disruptive to the user without tuning. The {@code fallback}
     * parameter allows you to decide whether you want to fallback to the generic implementation or
     * only play if there's a tuned, hardware specific one available.
     *
     * @param effectId The ID of the effect to perform:
     *                 {@link #EFFECT_CLICK}, {@link #EFFECT_DOUBLE_CLICK}, {@link #EFFECT_TICK}
     * @param fallback Whether to fallback to a generic pattern if a hardware specific
     *                 implementation doesn't exist.
     *
     * @return The desired effect.
