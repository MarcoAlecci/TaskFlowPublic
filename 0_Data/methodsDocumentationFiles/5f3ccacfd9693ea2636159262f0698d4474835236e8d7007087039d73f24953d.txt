     * Find the view that has the specified focus type. The search starts from
     * the view represented by this node info.
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> If this view hierarchy has a {@link SurfaceView} embedding another
     * view hierarchy via {@link SurfaceView#setChildSurfacePackage}, there is a limitation that
     * this API won't be able to find the node for the view on the embedded view hierarchy. It's
     * because views don't know about the embedded hierarchies. Instead, you could traverse all
     * the children to find the node. Or, use {@link AccessibilityService#findFocus(int)} for
     * {@link #FOCUS_ACCESSIBILITY} only since it has no such limitation.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param focus The focus to find. One of {@link #FOCUS_INPUT} or
     *         {@link #FOCUS_ACCESSIBILITY}.
     * @return The node info of the focused view or null.
