     * Restore a single application from backup.  The data will be restored from the
     * current backup dataset if the given package has stored data there, or from
     * the dataset used during the last full device setup operation if the current
     * backup dataset has no matching data.  If no backup data exists for this package
     * in either source, a nonzero value will be returned.
     *
     * @return Zero on success; nonzero on error.  The observer will only receive
     *   progress callbacks if this method returned zero.
     * @param packageName The name of the package whose data to restore.  If this is
     *   not the name of the caller's own package, then the android.permission.BACKUP
     *   permission must be held.
     * @param observer If non-null, this binder points to an object that will receive
     *   progress callbacks during the restore operation.
