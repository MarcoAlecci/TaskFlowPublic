     * Sets an additional clip on the RenderNode. If null, the extra clip is removed from the
     * RenderNode. If non-null, the RenderNode will be clipped to this rect. In addition  if
     * {@link #setClipToBounds(boolean)} is true, then the RenderNode will be clipped to the
     * intersection of this rectangle and the bounds of the render node, which is set with
     * {@link #setPosition(Rect)}.
     *
     * <p>This is equivalent to do a {@link Canvas#clipRect(Rect)} at the start of this
     * RenderNode's display list. However, as this is a property of the RenderNode instead
     * of part of the display list it can be more easily animated for transient additional
     * clipping. An example usage of this would be the {@link android.transition.ChangeBounds}
     * transition animation with the resizeClip=true option.
     *
     * @param rect the bounds to clip to. If null, the additional clip is removed.
     * @return True if the value changed, false if the new value was the same as the previous value.
