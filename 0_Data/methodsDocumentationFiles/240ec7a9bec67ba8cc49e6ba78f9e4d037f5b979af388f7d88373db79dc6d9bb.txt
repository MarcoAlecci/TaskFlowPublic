     * autoCancel controls whether an ObjectAnimator will be canceled automatically
     * when any other ObjectAnimator with the same target and properties is started.
     * Setting this flag may make it easier to run different animators on the same target
     * object without having to keep track of whether there are conflicting animators that
     * need to be manually canceled. Canceling animators must have the same exact set of
     * target properties, in the same order.
     *
     * @param cancel Whether future ObjectAnimators with the same target and properties
     * as this ObjectAnimator will cause this ObjectAnimator to be canceled.
