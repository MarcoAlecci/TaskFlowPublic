     * Returns an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom {@code
     * int} values, each conforming to the given origin (inclusive) and bound
     * (exclusive).
     *
     * @implNote This method is implemented to be equivalent to {@code
     * ints(Long.MAX_VALUE, randomNumberOrigin, randomNumberBound)}.
     *
     * @param randomNumberOrigin the origin (inclusive) of each random value
     * @param randomNumberBound the bound (exclusive) of each random value
     * @return a stream of pseudorandom {@code int} values,
     *         each with the given origin (inclusive) and bound (exclusive)
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code randomNumberOrigin}
     *         is greater than or equal to {@code randomNumberBound}
