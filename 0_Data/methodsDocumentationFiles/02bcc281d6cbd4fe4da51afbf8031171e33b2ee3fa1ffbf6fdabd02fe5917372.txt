     * Finish this activity as well as all activities immediately below it
     * in the current task that have the same affinity.  This is typically
     * used when an application can be launched on to another task (such as
     * from an ACTION_VIEW of a content type it understands) and the user
     * has used the up navigation to switch out of the current task and in
     * to its own task.  In this case, if the user has navigated down into
     * any other activities of the second application, all of those should
     * be removed from the original task as part of the task switch.
     *
     * <p>Note that this finish does <em>not</em> allow you to deliver results
     * to the previous activity, and an exception will be thrown if you are trying
     * to do so.</p>
