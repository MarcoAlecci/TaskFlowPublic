     * @param filePath The audio file.
     * @param kind The desired thumbnail kind, such as
     *            {@link android.provider.MediaStore.Images.Thumbnails#MINI_KIND}.
     * @deprecated Callers should migrate to using
     *             {@link #createAudioThumbnail(File, Size, CancellationSignal)},
     *             as it offers more control over resizing and cancellation.
