     * Call immediately after one of the flavors of {@link #startActivity(Intent)}
     * or {@link #finish} to specify an explicit transition animation to
     * perform next.
     *
     * <p>As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN} an alternative
     * to using this with starting activities is to supply the desired animation
     * information through a {@link ActivityOptions} bundle to
     * {@link #startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} or a related function.  This allows
     * you to specify a custom animation even when starting an activity from
     * outside the context of the current top activity.
     *
     * @param enterAnim A resource ID of the animation resource to use for
     * the incoming activity.  Use 0 for no animation.
     * @param exitAnim A resource ID of the animation resource to use for
     * the outgoing activity.  Use 0 for no animation.
