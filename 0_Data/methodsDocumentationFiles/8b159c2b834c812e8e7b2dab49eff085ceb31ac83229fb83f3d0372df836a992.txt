     * Convenience method that encodes the remaining content of a single input
     * character buffer into a newly-allocated byte buffer.
     *
     * <p> This method implements an entire <a href="#steps">encoding
     * operation</a>; that is, it resets this encoder, then it encodes the
     * characters in the given character buffer, and finally it flushes this
     * encoder.  This method should therefore not be invoked if an encoding
     * operation is already in progress.  </p>
     *
     * @param  in
     *         The input character buffer
     *
     * @return A newly-allocated byte buffer containing the result of the
     *         encoding operation.  The buffer's position will be zero and its
     *         limit will follow the last byte written.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException
     *          If an encoding operation is already in progress
     *
     * @throws  MalformedInputException
     *          If the character sequence starting at the input buffer's current
     *          position is not a legal sixteen-bit Unicode sequence and the current malformed-input action
     *          is {@link CodingErrorAction#REPORT}
     *
     * @throws  UnmappableCharacterException
     *          If the character sequence starting at the input buffer's current
     *          position cannot be mapped to an equivalent byte sequence and
     *          the current unmappable-character action is {@link
     *          CodingErrorAction#REPORT}
