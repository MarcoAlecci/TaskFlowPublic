     * Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_CHANGED} being received, informing you of
     * changes to the enabled/disabled state of components in a package
     * and/or of the overall package.
     *
     * @param packageName The name of the package that is changing.
     * @param uid The user ID the package runs under.
     * @param components Any components in the package that are changing.  If
     * the overall package is changing, this will contain an entry of the
     * package name itself.
     * @return Return true to indicate you care about this change, which will
     * result in {@link #onSomePackagesChanged()} being called later.  If you
     * return false, no further callbacks will happen about this change.  The
     * default implementation returns true if this is a change to the entire
     * package.
