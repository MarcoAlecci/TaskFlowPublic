     * Gets a {@link Canvas} for drawing into this surface that supports wide color gamut.
     *
     * After drawing into the provided {@link Canvas}, the caller must
     * invoke {@link #unlockCanvasAndPost} to post the new contents to the surface.
     *
     * Unlike {@link #lockCanvas(Rect)} and {@link #lockHardwareCanvas()},
     * this will return a hardware-accelerated canvas that supports wide color gamut.
     * See the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html#unsupported">
     * unsupported drawing operations</a> for a list of what is and isn't
     * supported in a hardware-accelerated canvas. It is also required to
     * fully cover the surface every time {@link #lockHardwareCanvas()} is
     * called as the buffer is not preserved between frames. Partial updates
     * are not supported.
     *
     * @return A canvas for drawing into the surface.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException If the canvas cannot be locked.
