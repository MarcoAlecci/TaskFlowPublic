     * Free the native object associated with this bitmap, and clear the
     * reference to the pixel data. This will not free the pixel data synchronously;
     * it simply allows it to be garbage collected if there are no other references.
     * The bitmap is marked as "dead", meaning it will throw an exception if
     * getPixels() or setPixels() is called, and will draw nothing. This operation
     * cannot be reversed, so it should only be called if you are sure there are no
     * further uses for the bitmap. This is an advanced call, and normally need
     * not be called, since the normal GC process will free up this memory when
     * there are no more references to this bitmap.
