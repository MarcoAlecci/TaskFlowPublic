     * <p>Copy the bitmap's pixels into the specified buffer (allocated by the
     * caller). An exception is thrown if the buffer is not large enough to
     * hold all of the pixels (taking into account the number of bytes per
     * pixel) or if the Buffer subclass is not one of the support types
     * (ByteBuffer, ShortBuffer, IntBuffer).</p>
     * <p>The content of the bitmap is copied into the buffer as-is. This means
     * that if this bitmap stores its pixels pre-multiplied
     * (see {@link #isPremultiplied()}, the values in the buffer will also be
     * pre-multiplied. The pixels remain in the color space of the bitmap.</p>
     * <p>After this method returns, the current position of the buffer is
     * updated: the position is incremented by the number of elements written
     * in the buffer.</p>
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the bitmap's config is {@link Config#HARDWARE}
