         * <P>The system will also attempt to resolve {@code mailto:} and {@code tel:} schema
         * URIs.  The path part of these URIs must exist in the contacts database, in the
         * appropriate column, or the reference will be discarded as invalid. Telephone schema
         * URIs will be resolved by {@link android.provider.ContactsContract.PhoneLookup}.
         * It is also possible to provide a URI with the schema {@code name:} in order to uniquely
         * identify a person without an entry in the contacts database.

         * @param uri A URI for the person.
