     * Mount an Opaque Binary Blob (OBB) file. If a <code>key</code> is
     * specified, it is supplied to the mounting process to be used in any
     * encryption used in the OBB.
     * <p>
     * The OBB will remain mounted for as long as the StorageManager reference
     * is held by the application. As soon as this reference is lost, the OBBs
     * in use will be unmounted. The {@link OnObbStateChangeListener} registered
     * with this call will receive the success or failure of this operation.
     * <p>
     * <em>Note:</em> you can only mount OBB files for which the OBB tag on the
     * file matches a package ID that is owned by the calling program's UID.
     * That is, shared UID applications can attempt to mount any other
     * application's OBB that shares its UID.
     *
     * @param rawPath the path to the OBB file
     * @param key secret used to encrypt the OBB; may be <code>null</code> if no
     *            encryption was used on the OBB.
     * @param listener will receive the success or failure of the operation
     * @return whether the mount call was successfully queued or not
