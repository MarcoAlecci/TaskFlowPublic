     * Sets the maximum arc along the circle between two points. When start and end points
     * have close to equal x and y differences, the curve between them is large. This forces
     * the curved path to have an arc of at most the given angle.
     * <p>The default value is 70 degrees.</p>
     *
     * @param angleInDegrees The maximum angle of the arc on a circle describing the Path
