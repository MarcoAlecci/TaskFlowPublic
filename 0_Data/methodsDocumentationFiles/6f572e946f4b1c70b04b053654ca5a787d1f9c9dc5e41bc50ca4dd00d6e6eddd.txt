     * The use of the {@link #append} function can result in invalid array maps, in particular
     * an array map where the same key appears multiple times.  This function verifies that
     * the array map is valid, throwing IllegalArgumentException if a problem is found.  The
     * main use for this method is validating an array map after unpacking from an IPC, to
     * protect against malicious callers.
