     * Return the ViewHolder for the item in the given position of the data set as of the latest
     * layout pass.
     * <p>
     * This method checks only the children of RecyclerView. If the item at the given
     * <code>position</code> is not laid out, it <em>will not</em> create a new one.
     * <p>
     * Note that when Adapter contents change, ViewHolder positions are not updated until the
     * next layout calculation. If there are pending adapter updates, the return value of this
     * method may not match your adapter contents. You can use
     * #{@link ViewHolder#getAdapterPosition()} to get the current adapter position of a ViewHolder.
     * <p>
     * When the ItemAnimator is running a change animation, there might be 2 ViewHolders
     * with the same layout position representing the same Item. In this case, the updated
     * ViewHolder will be returned.
     *
     * @param position The position of the item in the data set of the adapter
     * @return The ViewHolder at <code>position</code> or null if there is no such item
