         * Binds the given View to the position. The View can be a View previously retrieved via
         * {@link #getViewForPosition(int)} or created by
         * {@link Adapter#onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup, int)}.
         * <p>
         * Generally, a LayoutManager should acquire its views via {@link #getViewForPosition(int)}
         * and let the RecyclerView handle caching. This is a helper method for LayoutManager who
         * wants to handle its own recycling logic.
         * <p>
         * Note that, {@link #getViewForPosition(int)} already binds the View to the position so
         * you don't need to call this method unless you want to bind this View to another position.
         *
         * @param view The view to update.
         * @param position The position of the item to bind to this View.
