     * contains 2 values, <code>[X_radius, Y_radius]</code>. The corners are
     * ordered top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left.
     * <p>
     * If the radius was previously set with {@link #setCornerRadius(float)},
     * or if the corners are not rounded, this method will return {@code null}.
