     * Sets the target UDP re-transmit endpoint for the low level player.
     * Generally, the address portion of the endpoint is an IP multicast
     * address, although a unicast address would be equally valid.  When a valid
     * retransmit endpoint has been set, the media player will not decode and
     * render the media presentation locally.  Instead, the player will attempt
     * to re-multiplex its media data using the Android@Home RTP profile and
     * re-transmit to the target endpoint.  Receiver devices (which may be
     * either the same as the transmitting device or different devices) may
     * instantiate, prepare, and start a receiver player using a setDataSource
     * URL of the form...
     *
     * aahRX://&lt;multicastIP&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
     *
     * to receive, decode and render the re-transmitted content.
     *
     * setRetransmitEndpoint may only be called before setDataSource has been
     * called; while the player is in the Idle state.
     *
     * @param endpoint the address and UDP port of the re-transmission target or
     * null if no re-transmission is to be performed.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if it is called in an invalid state
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the retransmit endpoint is supplied,
     * but invalid.
