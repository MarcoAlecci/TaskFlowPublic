     * Acquires {@link Hardware} object for the given device ID.
     *
     * <p>A subsequent call to this method on the same {@code deviceId} could release the currently
     * acquired Hardware if TunerResourceManager(TRM) detects higher priority from the current
     * request.
     *
     * <p>If the client would like to provide information for the TRM to compare, use
     * {@link #acquireTvInputHardware(int, TvInputInfo, HardwareCallback, String, int)} instead.
     *
     * <p>Otherwise default priority will be applied.
     *
     * @param deviceId The device ID to acquire Hardware for.
     * @param info The TV input which will use the acquired Hardware.
     * @param callback A callback to receive updates on Hardware.
     * @return Hardware on success, {@code null} otherwise.
