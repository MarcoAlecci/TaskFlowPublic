     * screen capture also prevents the content from being shown on display devices that do not have
     * a secure video output. See {@link android.view.Display#FLAG_SECURE} for more details about
     * secure surfaces and secure displays.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance, returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)}, where the calling device admin must be
     * the profile owner of an organization-owned managed profile. If it is not, a security
     * exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the caller is device owner or called on the parent instance by a profile owner of an
     * organization-owned managed profile, then the restriction will be applied to all users.
     * <p>
     * From version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M} disabling screen capture also blocks
     * assist requests for all activities of the relevant user.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param disabled Whether screen capture is disabled or not.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device or profile owner or if
     *                           called on the parent profile and the {@code admin} is not a
     *                           profile owner of an organization-owned managed profile.
