     * Retrieve, creating if needed, a new directory in which the application
     * can place its own custom data files.  You can use the returned File
     * object to create and access files in this directory.  Note that files
     * created through a File object will only be accessible by your own
     * application; you can only set the mode of the entire directory, not
     * of individual files.
     * <p>
     * The returned path may change over time if the calling app is moved to an
     * adopted storage device, so only relative paths should be persisted.
     * <p>
     * Apps require no extra permissions to read or write to the returned path,
     * since this path lives in their private storage.
     *
     * @param name Name of the directory to retrieve.  This is a directory
     * that is created as part of your application data.
     * @param mode Operating mode.
     *
     * @return A {@link File} object for the requested directory.  The directory
     * will have been created if it does not already exist.
