     * Prepare to establish a VPN connection. This method returns {@code null}
     * if the VPN application is already prepared or if the user has previously
     * consented to the VPN application. Otherwise, it returns an
     * {@link Intent} to a system activity. The application should launch the
     * activity using {@link Activity#startActivityForResult} to get itself
     * prepared. The activity may pop up a dialog to require user action, and
     * the result will come back via its {@link Activity#onActivityResult}.
     * If the result is {@link Activity#RESULT_OK}, the application becomes
     * prepared and is granted to use other methods in this class.
     *
     * <p>Only one application can be granted at the same time. The right
     * is revoked when another application is granted. The application
     * losing the right will be notified via its {@link #onRevoke}. Unless
     * it becomes prepared again, subsequent calls to other methods in this
     * class will fail.
     *
     * <p>The user may disable the VPN at any time while it is activated, in
     * which case this method will return an intent the next time it is
     * executed to obtain the user's consent again.
