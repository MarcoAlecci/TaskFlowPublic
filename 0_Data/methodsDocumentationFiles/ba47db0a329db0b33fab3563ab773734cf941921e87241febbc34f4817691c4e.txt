     * Creates an InetAddress based on the provided host name and IP address.
     * No name service is checked for the validity of the address.

     *
     * <p> If addr specifies an IPv4 address an instance of Inet4Address
     * will be returned; otherwise, an instance of Inet6Address
     * will be returned.
     *
     * <p> IPv4 address byte array must be 4 bytes long and IPv6 byte array
     * must be 16 bytes long
     *
     * @param host the specified host
     * @param addr the raw IP address in network byte order
     * @return  an InetAddress object created from the raw IP address.
