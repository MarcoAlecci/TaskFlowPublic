     * This property is intended only for use by the Fade transition, which animates
     * it to produce a visual translucency that does not side-effect (or get affected
     * by) the real alpha property. This value is composited with the other alpha
     * value (and the AlphaAnimation value, when that is present) to produce a final
     * visual translucency result, which is what is passed into the DisplayList.
