     * Draw a run of text, all in a single direction, with optional context for complex text
     * shaping.
     * <p>
     * See {@link #drawTextRun(CharSequence, int, int, int, int, float, float, boolean, Paint)} for
     * more details. This method uses a character array rather than CharSequence to represent the
     * string. Also, to be consistent with the pattern established in {@link #drawText}, in this
     * method {@code count} and {@code contextCount} are used rather than offsets of the end
     * position; {@code count = end - start, contextCount = contextEnd -
     * contextStart}.
     *
     * @param text the text to render
     * @param index the start of the text to render
     * @param count the count of chars to render
     * @param contextIndex the start of the context for shaping. Must be no greater than index.
     * @param contextCount the number of characters in the context for shaping. contexIndex +
     *            contextCount must be no less than index + count.
     * @param x the x position at which to draw the text
     * @param y the y position at which to draw the text
     * @param isRtl whether the run is in RTL direction
     * @param paint the paint
