     * Enable more aggressive scheduling for latency-sensitive low-runtime VR threads. Only one
     * thread can be a VR thread in a process at a time, and that thread may be subject to
     * restrictions on the amount of time it can run.
     *
     * If persistent VR mode is set, whatever thread has been granted aggressive scheduling via this
     * method will return to normal operation, and calling this method will do nothing while
     * persistent VR mode is enabled.
     *
     * To reset the VR thread for an application, a tid of 0 can be passed.
     *
     * @see android.os.Process#myTid()
     * @param tid tid of the VR thread
