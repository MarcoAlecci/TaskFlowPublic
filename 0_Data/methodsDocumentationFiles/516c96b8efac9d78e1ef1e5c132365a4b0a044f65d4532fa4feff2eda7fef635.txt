     * Retrieve a dimensional unit attribute at <var>index</var> for use
     * as a size in raw pixels.  This is the same as
     * {@link #getDimension}, except the returned value is converted to
     * integer pixels for use as a size.  A size conversion involves
     * rounding the base value, and ensuring that a non-zero base value
     * is at least one pixel in size.
     * <p>
     * This method will throw an exception if the attribute is defined but is
     * not a dimension.
     *
     * @param index Index of attribute to retrieve.
     * @param defValue Value to return if the attribute is not defined or
     *                 not a resource.
     *
     * @return Attribute dimension value multiplied by the appropriate
     *         metric and truncated to integer pixels, or defValue if not defined.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the TypedArray has already been recycled.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the attribute is defined but is
     *         not a dimension.
