     * Sets the activation edge type, one of:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #EDGE_TYPE_INSIDE} for edges that respond to touches inside
     * the bounds of the host view. If touch moves outside the bounds, scrolling
     * will stop.
     * <li>{@link #EDGE_TYPE_INSIDE_EXTEND} for inside edges that continued to
     * scroll when touch moves outside the bounds of the host view.
     * <li>{@link #EDGE_TYPE_OUTSIDE} for edges that only respond to touches
     * that move outside the bounds of the host view.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param type The type of edge to use.
     * @return The scroll helper, which may used to chain setter calls.
