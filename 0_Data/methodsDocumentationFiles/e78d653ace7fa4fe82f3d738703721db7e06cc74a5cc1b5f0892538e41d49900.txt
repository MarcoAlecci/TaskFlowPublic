     * <p>Sets the transform to associate with this texture view.
     * The specified transform applies to the underlying surface
     * texture and does not affect the size or position of the view
     * itself, only of its content.</p>
     *
     * <p>Some transforms might prevent the content from drawing
     * all the pixels contained within this view's bounds. In such
     * situations, make sure this texture view is not marked opaque.</p>
     *
     * @param transform The transform to apply to the content of
     *        this view. If null the transform will be set to identity.
