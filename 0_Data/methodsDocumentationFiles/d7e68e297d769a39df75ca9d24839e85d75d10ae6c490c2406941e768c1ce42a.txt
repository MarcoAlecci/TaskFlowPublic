     * For a service previously bound with {@link #bindService} or a related method, change
     * how the system manages that service's process in relation to other processes.  This
     * doesn't modify the original bind flags that were passed in when binding, but adjusts
     * how the process will be managed in some cases based on those flags.  Currently only
     * works on isolated processes (will be ignored for non-isolated processes).
     *
     * <p>Note that this call does not take immediate effect, but will be applied the next
     * time the impacted process is adjusted for some other reason.  Typically you would
     * call this before then calling a new {@link #bindIsolatedService} on the service
     * of interest, with that binding causing the process to be shuffled accordingly.</p>

     * @param conn The connection interface previously supplied to bindService().  This
     *             parameter must not be null.
     * @param group A group to put this connection's process in.  Upon calling here, this
     *              will override any previous group that was set for that process.  The group
     *              tells the system about processes that are logically grouped together, so
     *              should be managed as one unit of importance (such as when being considered
     *              a recently used app).  All processes in the same app with the same group
     *              are considered to be related.  Supplying 0 reverts to the default behavior
     *              of not grouping.
     * @param importance Additional importance of the processes within a group.  Upon calling
     *                   here, this will override any previous importance that was set for that
     *                   process.  The most important process is 0, and higher values are
     *                   successively less important.  You can view this as describing how
     *                   to order the processes in an array, with the processes at the end of
     *                   the array being the least important.  This value has no meaning besides
     *                   indicating how processes should be ordered in that array one after the
     *                   other.  This provides a way to fine-tune the system's process killing,
     *                   guiding it to kill processes at the end of the array first.
