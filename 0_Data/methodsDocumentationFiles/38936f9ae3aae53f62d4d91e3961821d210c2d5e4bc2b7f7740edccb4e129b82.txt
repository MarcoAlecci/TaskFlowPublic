     * Returns an immutable, ordered list of time zone mappings for the country in an undefined but
     * "priority" order, filtered so that only "effective" time zone IDs are returned. An
     * "effective" time zone is one that differs from another time zone used in the country after
     * {@code whenMillis}. The list can be empty if there were no zones configured or the configured
     * zone IDs were not recognized.
