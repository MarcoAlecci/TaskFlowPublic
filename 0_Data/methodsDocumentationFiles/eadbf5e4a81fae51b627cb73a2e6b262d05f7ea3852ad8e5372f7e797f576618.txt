     * Get the next collation element in the string.  <p>This iterator iterates
     * over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string.
     * Because there isn't necessarily a one-to-one mapping from characters to
     * collation elements, this doesn't mean the same thing as "return the
     * collation element [or ordering priority] of the next character in the
     * string".</p>
     * <p>This function returns the collation element that the iterator is currently
     * pointing to and then updates the internal pointer to point to the next element.
     * previous() updates the pointer first and then returns the element.  This
     * means that when you change direction while iterating (i.e., call next() and
     * then call previous(), or call previous() and then call next()), you'll get
     * back the same element twice.</p>
     *
     * @return the next collation element
