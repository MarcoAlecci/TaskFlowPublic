     * Set up a perspective projection matrix
     *
     * @param gl a GL10 interface
     * @param fovy specifies the field of view angle, in degrees, in the Y
     *        direction.
     * @param aspect specifies the aspect ration that determins the field of
     *        view in the x direction. The aspect ratio is the ratio of x
     *        (width) to y (height).
     * @param zNear specifies the distance from the viewer to the near clipping
     *        plane (always positive).
     * @param zFar specifies the distance from the viewer to the far clipping
     *        plane (always positive).
