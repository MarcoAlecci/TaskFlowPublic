     * Retrieve a dimensional for a particular resource ID for use
     * as an offset in raw pixels.  This is the same as
     * {@link #getDimension}, except the returned value is converted to
     * integer pixels for you.  An offset conversion involves simply
     * truncating the base value to an integer.
     * 
     * @param id The desired resource identifier, as generated by the aapt
     *           tool. This integer encodes the package, type, and resource
     *           entry. The value 0 is an invalid identifier.
     * 
     * @return Resource dimension value multiplied by the appropriate 
     * metric and truncated to integer pixels.
     * 
     * @throws NotFoundException Throws NotFoundException if the given ID does not exist.
