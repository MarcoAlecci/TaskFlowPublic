         * <p>The stable inset represents the area of a full-screen window that <b>may</b> be
         * partially or fully obscured by the system UI elements.  This value does not change
         * based on the visibility state of those elements; for example, if the status bar is
         * normally shown, but temporarily hidden, the stable inset will still provide the inset
         * associated with the status bar being shown.</p>
