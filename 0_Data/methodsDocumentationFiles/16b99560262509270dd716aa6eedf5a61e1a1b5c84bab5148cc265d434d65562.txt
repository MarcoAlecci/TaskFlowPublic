     * Sets the playback sample rate for this track. This sets the sampling rate at which
     * the audio data will be consumed and played back
     * (as set by the sampleRateInHz parameter in the
     * {@link #AudioTrack(int, int, int, int, int, int)} constructor),
     * not the original sampling rate of the
     * content. For example, setting it to half the sample rate of the content will cause the
     * playback to last twice as long, but will also result in a pitch shift down by one octave.
     * The valid sample rate range is from 1 Hz to twice the value returned by
     * {@link #getNativeOutputSampleRate(int)}.
     * Use {@link #setPlaybackParams(PlaybackParams)} for speed control.
     * <p> This method may also be used to repurpose an existing <code>AudioTrack</code>
     * for playback of content of differing sample rate,
     * but with identical encoding and channel mask.
     * @param sampleRateInHz the sample rate expressed in Hz
