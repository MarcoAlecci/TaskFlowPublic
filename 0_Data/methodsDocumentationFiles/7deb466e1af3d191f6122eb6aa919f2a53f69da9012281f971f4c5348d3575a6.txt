     * Begin postponed transitions after {@link #postponeEnterTransition()} was called.
     * If postponeEnterTransition() was called, you must call startPostponedEnterTransition()
     * or {@link FragmentManager#executePendingTransactions()} to complete the FragmentTransaction.
     * If postponement was interrupted with {@link FragmentManager#executePendingTransactions()},
     * before {@code startPostponedEnterTransition()}, animations may not run or may execute
     * improperly.
