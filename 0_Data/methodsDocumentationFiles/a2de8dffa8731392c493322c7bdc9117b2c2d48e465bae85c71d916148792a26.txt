     * Notifies this Connection of a request to silence the ringer.
     * <p>
     * The ringer may be silenced by any of the following methods:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>{@link TelecomManager#silenceRinger()}</li>
     *     <li>The user presses the volume-down button while a call is ringing.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Self-managed {@link ConnectionService} implementations should override this method in their
     * {@link Connection} implementation and implement logic to silence their app's ringtone.  If
     * your app set the ringtone as part of the incoming call {@link Notification} (see
     * {@link #onShowIncomingCallUi()}), it should re-post the notification now, except call
     * {@link android.app.Notification.Builder#setOnlyAlertOnce(boolean)} with {@code true}.  This
     * will ensure the ringtone sound associated with your {@link android.app.NotificationChannel}
     * stops playing.
