     * Inform the notification manager about snoozing a specific notification.
     * <p>
     * Use this if your listener has a user interface that allows the user to snooze a notification
     * for a time. It should be called after the user snoozes a single notification using
     * your UI; upon being informed, the notification manager will actually remove the notification
     * and you will get an {@link #onNotificationRemoved(StatusBarNotification)} callback. When the
     * snoozing period expires, you will get a
     * {@link #onNotificationPosted(StatusBarNotification, RankingMap)} callback for the
     * notification.
     * @param key The key of the notification to snooze
     * @param durationMs A duration to snooze the notification for, in milliseconds.
