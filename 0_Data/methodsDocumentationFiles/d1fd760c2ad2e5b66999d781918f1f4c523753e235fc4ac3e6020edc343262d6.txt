     * dispatching the event to an application.

     * If the event is a {@link MotionEvent} then it is recycled.
     *
     * If the event is a {@link KeyEvent} then it is NOT recycled, because applications
     * expect key events to be immutable so once the event has been dispatched to
     * the application we can no longer recycle it.
