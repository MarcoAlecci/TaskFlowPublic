     * Start watching for noted app ops. An app op may be immediate or long running.
     * Immediate ops are noted while long running ones are started and stopped. This
     * method allows registering a listener to be notified when an app op is noted. If
     * an op is being noted by any package you will get a callback. To change the
     * watched ops for a registered callback you need to unregister and register it again.
     *
     * <p> If you don't hold the {@link android.Manifest.permission#WATCH_APPOPS} permission
     * you can watch changes only for your UID.
     *
     * @param ops The ops to watch.
     * @param callback Where to report changes.
