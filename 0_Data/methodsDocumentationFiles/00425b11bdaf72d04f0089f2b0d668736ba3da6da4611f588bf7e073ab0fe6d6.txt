     *  Specify whether the {@link Bitmap} should be mutable.
     *
     *  <p>By default, a {@link Bitmap} created will be immutable, but that can
     *  be changed with this call.</p>
     *
     *  <p>Mutable Bitmaps are incompatible with {@link #ALLOCATOR_HARDWARE},
     *  because {@link Bitmap.Config#HARDWARE} Bitmaps cannot be mutable.
     *  Attempting to combine them will throw an
     *  {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}.</p>
     *
     *  <p>Mutable Bitmaps are also incompatible with {@link #decodeDrawable},
     *  which would require retrieving the Bitmap from the returned Drawable in
     *  order to modify. Attempting to decode a mutable {@link Drawable} will
     *  throw an {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}.</p>
