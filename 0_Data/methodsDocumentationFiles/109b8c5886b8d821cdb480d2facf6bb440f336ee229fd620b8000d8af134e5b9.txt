     * Returns A {@link Coordinate3F} object that represents the orientation of microphone.
     * X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis show as the x, y, z value. The orientation will be normalized
     * such as sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) equals 1.
     *
     * @return the orientation of the microphone or {@link #ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN} if orientation
     * is unknown
