     * <p>
     * A live region is a node that contains information that is important for
     * the user and when it changes the user should be notified. For example,
     * in a login screen with a TextView that displays an "incorrect password"
     * notification, that view should be marked as a live region with mode
     * {@link View#ACCESSIBILITY_LIVE_REGION_POLITE}.
     * <p>
     * It is the responsibility of the accessibility service to monitor
     * {@link AccessibilityEvent#TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED} events indicating
     * changes to live region nodes and their children.
     *
     * @return The live region mode, or
     *         {@link View#ACCESSIBILITY_LIVE_REGION_NONE} if the view is not a
     *         live region.
     * @see android.view.View#getAccessibilityLiveRegion()
