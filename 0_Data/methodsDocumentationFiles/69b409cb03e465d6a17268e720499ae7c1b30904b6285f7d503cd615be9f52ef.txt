     * then the drawable is drawn in a round-rectangle, rather than a
     * rectangle. This property is honored only when the shape is of type
     * {@link #RECTANGLE}.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note</strong>: changing this property will affect all instances
     * of a drawable loaded from a resource. It is recommended to invoke
     * {@link #mutate()} before changing this property.
