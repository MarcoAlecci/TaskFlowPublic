     * Removes an event listener for property change events.
     * If the same listener instance has been added to the listener table
     * through multiple invocations of <CODE>addPropertyChangeListener</CODE>,
     * then an equivalent number of
     * <CODE>removePropertyChangeListener</CODE> invocations are required to remove
     * all instances of that listener from the listener table.
     * <P>
     * Returns silently if the given listener is not found.
     *

     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
     *             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
     * @deprecated The dependency on {@code PropertyChangeListener} creates a
     *             significant impediment to future modularization of the Java
     *             platform. This method will be removed in a future release.
     *             The global {@code LogManager} can detect changes to the
     *             logging configuration by overridding the {@link
     *             #readConfiguration readConfiguration} method.
