     * Get the drawing order of the view corresponding it this node.
     * <p>
     * Drawing order is determined only within the node's parent, so this index is only relative
     * to its siblings.
     * <p>
     * In some cases, the drawing order is essentially simultaneous, so it is possible for two
     * siblings to return the same value. It is also possible that values will be skipped.
     *
     * @return The drawing position of the view corresponding to this node relative to its siblings.
