     * <p>Returns bounds which are used as a center of the enter and exit transitions.<p/>
     *
     * <p>Transitions use Rect, referred to as the epicenter, to orient
     * the direction of travel. For popup windows, the anchor view bounds are
     * used as the default epicenter.</p>
     *
     * <p>See {@link Transition#setEpicenterCallback(EpicenterCallback)} for more
     * information about how transition epicenters work.</p>

     * @return bounds relative to anchor view, or {@code null} if not set
