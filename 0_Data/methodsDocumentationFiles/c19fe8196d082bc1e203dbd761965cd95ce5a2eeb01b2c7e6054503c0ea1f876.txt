     * Called by Telecom to request that a {@link ConnectionService} creates an instance of an
     * incoming handover {@link Connection}.
     * <p>
     * A call handover is the process where an ongoing call is transferred from one app (i.e.
     * {@link ConnectionService} to another app.  The user could, for example, choose to continue a
     * mobile network call in a video calling app.  The mobile network call via the Telephony stack
     * is referred to as the source of the handover, and the video calling app is referred to as the
     * destination.
     * <p>
     * When considering a handover scenario the <em>initiating</em> device is where a user initiated
     * the handover process (e.g. by calling {@link android.telecom.Call#handoverTo(
     * PhoneAccountHandle, int, Bundle)}, and the other device is considered the <em>receiving</em>
     * device.
     * <p>
     * This method is called on the destination app on the <em>receiving</em> device when the
     * destination app calls {@link TelecomManager#acceptHandover(Uri, int, PhoneAccountHandle)} to
     * accept an incoming handover from the <em>initiating</em> device.
     * <p>
     * For a full discussion of the handover process and the APIs involved, see
     * {@link android.telecom.Call#handoverTo(PhoneAccountHandle, int, Bundle)}.
     * <p>
     * Implementations of this method should return an instance of {@link Connection} which
     * represents the handover.  The code below shows an example of how this is done.
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * public Connection onCreateIncomingHandoverConnection(PhoneAccountHandle
     *     fromPhoneAccountHandle, ConnectionRequest request) {
     *   // Given that your app requested to accept the handover, you should not return null here.
     *   MyConnection connection = new MyConnection();
     *   connection.setAddress(request.getAddress(), TelecomManager.PRESENTATION_ALLOWED);
     *   connection.setVideoState(request.getVideoState());
     *   return connection;
     * }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param fromPhoneAccountHandle {@link PhoneAccountHandle} associated with the
     *                               ConnectionService which needs to handover the call.
     * @param request Details about the call which needs to be handover.
     * @return {@link Connection} instance corresponding to the handover call.
