     * <p>Enable or disable the default shutter sound when taking a picture.</p>
     *
     * <p>By default, the camera plays the system-defined camera shutter sound
     * when {@link #takePicture} is called. Using this method, the shutter sound
     * can be disabled. It is strongly recommended that an alternative shutter
     * sound is played in the {@link ShutterCallback} when the system shutter
     * sound is disabled.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that devices may not always allow disabling the camera shutter
     * sound. If the shutter sound state cannot be set to the desired value,
     * this method will return false. {@link CameraInfo#canDisableShutterSound}
     * can be used to determine whether the device will allow the shutter sound
     * to be disabled.</p>

     * @param enabled whether the camera should play the system shutter sound
     *                when {@link #takePicture takePicture} is called.
     * @return {@code true} if the shutter sound state was successfully
     *         changed. {@code false} if the shutter sound state could not be
     *         changed. {@code true} is also returned if shutter sound playback
     *         is already set to the requested state.
     * @throws RuntimeException if the call fails; usually this would be because
     *    of a hardware or other low-level error, or because release() has been
     *    called on this Camera instance.
