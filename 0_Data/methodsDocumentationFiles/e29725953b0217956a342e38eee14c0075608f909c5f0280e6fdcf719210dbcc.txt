     * Writes a trace message to indicate that a given section of code has
     * begun. Must be followed by a call to {@link #endAsyncSection(String, int)} with the same
     * methodName and cookie. Unlike {@link #beginSection(String)} and {@link #endSection()},
     * asynchronous events do not need to be nested. The name and cookie used to
     * begin an event must be used to end it.
     *
     * @param methodName The method name to appear in the trace.
     * @param cookie Unique identifier for distinguishing simultaneous events
