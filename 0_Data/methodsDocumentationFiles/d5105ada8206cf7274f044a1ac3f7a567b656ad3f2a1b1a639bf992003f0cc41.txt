     * <p>
     * Create a new ImageWriter with given number of max Images and format.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The {@code maxImages} parameter determines the maximum number of
     * {@link Image} objects that can be be dequeued from the
     * {@code ImageWriter} simultaneously. Requesting more buffers will use up
     * more memory, so it is important to use only the minimum number necessary.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The format specifies the image format of this ImageWriter. The format
     * from the {@code surface} will be overridden with this format. For example,
     * if the surface is obtained from a {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture}, the default
     * format may be {@link PixelFormat#RGBA_8888}. If the application creates an ImageWriter
     * with this surface and {@link ImageFormat#PRIVATE}, this ImageWriter will be able to operate
     * with {@link ImageFormat#PRIVATE} Images.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that the consumer end-point may or may not be able to support Images with different
     * format, for such case, the application should only use this method if the consumer is able
     * to consume such images.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The input Image size depends on the Surface that is provided by
     * the downstream consumer end-point.

     *
     * @param surface The destination Surface this writer produces Image data
     *            into.
     * @param maxImages The maximum number of Images the user will want to
     *            access simultaneously for producing Image data. This should be
     *            as small as possible to limit memory use. Once maxImages
     *            Images are dequeued by the user, one of them has to be queued
     *            back before a new Image can be dequeued for access via
     *            {@link #dequeueInputImage()}.
     * @param format The format of this ImageWriter. It can be any valid format specified by
     *            {@link ImageFormat} or {@link PixelFormat}.
     *
     * @return a new ImageWriter instance.
