     * Inflates a view with the content of this suggestion at a specific size.
     *
     * <p> Each dimension of the size must satisfy one of the following conditions:
     *
     * <ol>
     *     <li>between {@link android.widget.inline.InlinePresentationSpec#getMinSize()} and
     * {@link android.widget.inline.InlinePresentationSpec#getMaxSize()} of the presentation spec
     * from {@code mInfo}
     *     <li>{@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#WRAP_CONTENT}
     * </ol>
     *
     * If the size is set to {@link
     * ViewGroup.LayoutParams#WRAP_CONTENT}, then the size of the inflated view will be just large
     * enough to fit the content, while still conforming to the min / max size specified by the
     * {@link android.widget.inline.InlinePresentationSpec}.
     *
     * <p> The caller can attach an {@link android.view.View.OnClickListener} and/or an
     * {@link android.view.View.OnLongClickListener} to the view in the {@code callback} to receive
     * click and long click events on the view.
     *
     * @param context  Context in which to inflate the view.
     * @param size     The size at which to inflate the suggestion. For each dimension, it maybe an
     *                 exact value or {@link ViewGroup.LayoutParams#WRAP_CONTENT}.
     * @param callback Callback for receiving the inflated view, where the {@link
     *                 ViewGroup.LayoutParams} of the view is set as the actual size of the
     *                 underlying remote view.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If an invalid argument is passed.
     * @throws IllegalStateException    If this method is already called.
