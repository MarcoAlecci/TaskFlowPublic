         * Notify any registered observers that the <code>itemCount</code> items starting at
         * position <code>positionStart</code> have changed. An optional payload can be
         * passed to each changed item.
         *
         * <p>This is an item change event, not a structural change event. It indicates that any
         * reflection of the data in the given position range is out of date and should be updated.
         * The items in the given range retain the same identity.
         * </p>
         *
         * <p>
         * Client can optionally pass a payload for partial change. These payloads will be merged
         * and may be passed to adapter's {@link #onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder, int, List)} if the
         * item is already represented by a ViewHolder and it will be rebound to the same
         * ViewHolder. A notifyItemRangeChanged() with null payload will clear all existing
         * payloads on that item and prevent future payload until
         * {@link #onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder, int, List)} is called. Adapter should not assume
         * that the payload will always be passed to onBindViewHolder(), e.g. when the view is not
         * attached, the payload will be simply dropped.
