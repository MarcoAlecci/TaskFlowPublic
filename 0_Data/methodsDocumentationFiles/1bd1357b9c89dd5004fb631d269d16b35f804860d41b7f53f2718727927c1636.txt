     * Generate a delta Configuration between <code>base</code> and <code>change</code>. The
     * resulting delta can be used with {@link #updateFrom(Configuration)}.
     * <p />
     * Caveat: If the any of the Configuration's members becomes undefined, then
     * {@link #updateFrom(Configuration)} will treat it as a no-op and not update that member.
     *
     * This is fine for device configurations as no member is ever undefined.
