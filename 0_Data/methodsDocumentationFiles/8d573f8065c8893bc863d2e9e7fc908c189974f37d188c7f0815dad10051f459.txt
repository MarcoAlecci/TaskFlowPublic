     * Resets the auto-off timer and brightens the screen if the device
     * is not asleep.  This is what happens normally when a key or the touch
     * screen is pressed or when some other user activity occurs.
     * This method does not wake up the device if it has been put to sleep.

     * @param when The time of the user activity, in the {@link SystemClock#uptimeMillis()}
     * time base.  This timestamp is used to correctly order the user activity request with
     * other power management functions.  It should be set
     * to the timestamp of the input event that caused the user activity.
     * @param noChangeLights If true, does not cause the keyboard backlight to turn on
     * because of this event.  This is set when the power key is pressed.
     * We want the device to stay on while the button is down, but we're about
     * to turn off the screen so we don't want the keyboard backlight to turn on again.
     * Otherwise the lights flash on and then off and it looks weird.
