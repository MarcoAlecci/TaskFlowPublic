     * Computes the approximate distance in meters between two
     * locations, and optionally the initial and final bearings of the
     * shortest path between them.  Distance and bearing are defined using the
     * WGS84 ellipsoid.
     *
     * <p> The computed distance is stored in results[0].  If results has length
     * 2 or greater, the initial bearing is stored in results[1]. If results has
     * length 3 or greater, the final bearing is stored in results[2].
     *
     * @param startLatitude the starting latitude
     * @param startLongitude the starting longitude
     * @param endLatitude the ending latitude
     * @param endLongitude the ending longitude
     * @param results an array of floats to hold the results
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if results is null or has length < 1
