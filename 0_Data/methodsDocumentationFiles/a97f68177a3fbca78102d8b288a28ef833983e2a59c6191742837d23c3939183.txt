     * Registers a callback to be invoked when an output frame is rendered on the output surface.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called in any codec state, but will only have an effect in the
     * Executing state for codecs that render buffers to the output surface.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> This callback is for informational purposes only: to get precise
     * render timing samples, and can be significantly delayed and batched. Some frames may have
     * been rendered even if there was no callback generated.
     *
     * @param listener the callback that will be run
     * @param handler the callback will be run on the handler's thread. If {@code null},
     *           the callback will be run on the default thread, which is the looper
     *           from which the codec was created, or a new thread if there was none.
