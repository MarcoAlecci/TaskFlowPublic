     * <strong>Note:</strong> Starting from {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP_MR1}, the
     * behavior of this API is changed such that passing {@code null} as the {@code admin} parameter
     * will return if any admin has blocked the uninstallation. Before L MR1, passing {@code null}
     * will cause a NullPointerException to be raised.
     *
     * @param admin The name of the admin component whose blocking policy will be checked, or

     * @return true if uninstallation is blocked.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device or profile owner.
