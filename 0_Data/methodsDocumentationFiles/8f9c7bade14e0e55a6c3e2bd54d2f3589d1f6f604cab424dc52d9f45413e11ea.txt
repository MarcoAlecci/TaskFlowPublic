     * <p>In contrast to other adapter-backed views such as {@link android.widget.ListView}
     * or {@link android.widget.GridView}, RecyclerView allows client code to provide custom
     * layout arrangements for child views. These arrangements are controlled by the
     * {@link LayoutManager}. A LayoutManager must be provided for RecyclerView to function.</p>
     *
     * <p>Several default strategies are provided for common uses such as lists and grids.</p>
