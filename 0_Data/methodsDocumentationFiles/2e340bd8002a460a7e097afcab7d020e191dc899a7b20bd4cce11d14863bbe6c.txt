     * all new security logging entries since the last call to this API after device boots.
     *
     * <p> Access to the logs is rate limited and it will only return new logs after the device
     * owner has been notified via {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#onSecurityLogsAvailable}.
     *
     * <p> When called by a device owner, if there is any other user or profile on the device,
     * it must be affiliated with the device. Otherwise a {@link SecurityException} will be thrown.
     * See {@link #isAffiliatedUser}.
     *
     * @param admin Which device admin this request is associated with.
     * @return the new batch of security logs which is a list of {@link SecurityEvent},
     * or {@code null} if rate limitation is exceeded or if logging is currently disabled.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not allowed to access security logging,
     * or there is at least one profile or secondary user that is not affiliated with the device.
