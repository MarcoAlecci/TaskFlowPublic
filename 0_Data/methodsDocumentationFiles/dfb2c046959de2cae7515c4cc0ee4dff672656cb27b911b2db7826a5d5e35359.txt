     * Called when all saved state has been restored into the view hierarchy
     * of the fragment.  This can be used to do initialization based on saved
     * state that you are letting the view hierarchy track itself, such as
     * whether check box widgets are currently checked.  This is called
     * after {@link #onActivityCreated(Bundle)} and before
     * {@link #onStart()}.
     *
     * @param savedInstanceState If the fragment is being re-created from
     * a previous saved state, this is the state.
