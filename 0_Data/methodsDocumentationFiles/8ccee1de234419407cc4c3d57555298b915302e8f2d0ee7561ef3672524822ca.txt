     * Calling this method allows the service to tell the OS
     * that it won't be able to complete this transaction -
     * for example, because it requires data connectivity
     * that is not present at that moment.
     *
     * The OS may use this indication to give the user a list
     * of alternative applications that can handle the last
     * AID that was selected. If the user would select an
     * application from the list, that action by itself
     * will not cause the default to be changed; the selected
     * application will be invoked for the next tap only.
     *
     * If there are no other applications that can handle
     * this transaction, the OS will show an error dialog
     * indicating your service could not complete the
     * transaction.
     *
     * <p>Note: this method may be called anywhere between
     *    the first {@link #processCommandApdu(byte[], Bundle)}
     *    call and a {@link #onDeactivated(int)} call.
