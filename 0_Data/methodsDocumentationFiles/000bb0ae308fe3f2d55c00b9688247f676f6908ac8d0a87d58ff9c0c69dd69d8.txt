     * Check both a Uri and normal permission.  This allows you to perform
     * both {@link #checkPermission} and {@link #checkUriPermission} in one
     * call.
     *
     * @param uri The Uri whose permission is to be checked, or null to not
     * do this check.
     * @param readPermission The permission that provides overall read access,
     * or null to not do this check.
     * @param writePermission The permission that provides overall write
     * access, or null to not do this check.
     * @param pid The process ID being checked against.  Must be &gt; 0.
     * @param uid The user ID being checked against.  A uid of 0 is the root
     * user, which will pass every permission check.
     * @param modeFlags The access modes to check.
     *
     * @return {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_GRANTED} if the caller
     * is allowed to access that uri or holds one of the given permissions, or
     * {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_DENIED} if it is not.
