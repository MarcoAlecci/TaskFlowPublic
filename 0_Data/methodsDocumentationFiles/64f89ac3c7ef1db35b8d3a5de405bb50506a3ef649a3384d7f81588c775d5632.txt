     * <p class="note"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The framework does no permission checking
     * on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application
     * to get access to the provider at all.  For example, it has no idea whether the call
     * being executed may read or write data in the provider, so can't enforce those
     * individual permissions.  Any implementation of this method <strong>must</strong>
     * do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed.</p>

     * @param method method name to call.  Opaque to framework, but should not be {@code null}.
     * @param arg provider-defined String argument.  May be {@code null}.
     * @param extras provider-defined Bundle argument.  May be {@code null}.
     * @return provider-defined return value.  May be {@code null}, which is also
     *   the default for providers which don't implement any call methods.
