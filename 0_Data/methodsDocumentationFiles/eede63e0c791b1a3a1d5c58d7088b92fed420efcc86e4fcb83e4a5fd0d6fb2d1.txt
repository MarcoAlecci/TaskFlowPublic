     * Returns whether the caller can access the shortcut information.  Access is currently
     * available to:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>The current launcher (or default launcher if there is no set current launcher).</li>
     *     <li>The currently active voice interaction service.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Note when this method returns {@code false}, it may be a temporary situation because
     * the user is trying a new launcher application.  The user may decide to change the default
     * launcher back to the calling application again, so even if a launcher application loses
     * this permission, it does <b>not</b> have to purge pinned shortcut information.
     * If the calling launcher application contains pinned shortcuts, they will still work,
     * even though the caller no longer has the shortcut host permission.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException when the user is locked.
