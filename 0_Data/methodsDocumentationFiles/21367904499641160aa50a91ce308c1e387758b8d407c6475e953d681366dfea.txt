     * Ask to have the current assistant shown to the user.  This only works if the calling
     * activity is the current foreground activity.  It is the same as calling
     * {@link android.service.voice.VoiceInteractionService#showSession
     * VoiceInteractionService.showSession} and requesting all of the possible context.
     * The receiver will always see
     * {@link android.service.voice.VoiceInteractionSession#SHOW_SOURCE_APPLICATION} set.
     * @return Returns true if the assistant was successfully invoked, else false.  For example
     * false will be returned if the caller is not the current top activity.
