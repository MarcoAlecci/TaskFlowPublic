     * Used to enable or disable carrier data by the system based on carrier signalling or
     * carrier privileged apps. Different from {@link #setDataEnabled(boolean)} which is linked to
     * user settings, carrier data on/off won't affect user settings but will bypass the
     * settings and turns off data internally if set to {@code false}.
     *
     * <p>If this object has been created with {@link #createForSubscriptionId}, applies to the
     * given subId. Otherwise, applies to {@link SubscriptionManager#getDefaultDataSubscriptionId()}
