         * Like {@link #isRunning()}, this method returns whether there are any item
         * animations currently running. Additionally, the listener passed in will be called
         * when there are no item animations running, either immediately (before the method
         * returns) if no animations are currently running, or when the currently running
         * animations are {@link #dispatchAnimationsFinished() finished}.
         *
         * <p>Note that the listener is transient - it is either called immediately and not
         * stored at all, or stored only until it is called when running animations
         * are finished sometime later.</p>
         *
         * @param listener A listener to be called immediately if no animations are running
         * or later when currently-running animations have finished. A null listener is
         * equivalent to calling {@link #isRunning()}.
         * @return true if there are any item animations currently running, false otherwise.
