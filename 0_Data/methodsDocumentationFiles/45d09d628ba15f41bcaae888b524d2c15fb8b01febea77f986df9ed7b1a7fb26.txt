     * Convenience method for determining if the SyncResult indicates that a soft error
     * occurred. See {@link #SyncResult()} for an explanation of what the SyncManager does
     * when it sees a soft error.
     * <p>
     * A soft error is indicated when any of the following is true:
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link SyncStats#numIoExceptions} > 0
     * <li> {@link #syncAlreadyInProgress}
     * </ul>
     * @return true if a soft error is indicated
