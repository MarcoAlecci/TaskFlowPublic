     * Constructs and returns an ObjectAnimator that animates a property along a <code>Path</code>.
     * A <code>Path</code></> animation moves in two dimensions, animating coordinates
     * <code>(x, y)</code> together to follow the line. This variant animates the coordinates
     * in a <code>PointF</code> to follow the <code>Path</code>. If the <code>Property</code>
     * associated with <code>propertyName</code> uses a type other than <code>PointF</code>,
     * <code>converter</code> can be used to change from <code>PointF</code> to the type
     * associated with the <code>Property</code>.
     *
     * @param target The object whose property is to be animated. This object should
     * have a public method on it called <code>setName()</code>, where <code>name</code> is
     * the value of the <code>propertyName</code> parameter.
     * @param propertyName The name of the property being animated.
     * @param converter Converts a PointF to the type associated with the setter. May be
     *                  null if conversion is unnecessary.
     * @param path The <code>Path</code> to animate values along.
     * @return An ObjectAnimator object that is set up to animate along <code>path</code>.
