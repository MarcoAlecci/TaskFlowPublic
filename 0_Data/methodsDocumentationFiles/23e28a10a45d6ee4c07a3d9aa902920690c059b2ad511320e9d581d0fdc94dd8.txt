     * An extended version of onCurrentVrActivityChanged
     *
     * <p>This will be called when this service is initially bound, but is not
     * guaranteed to be called before onUnbind.  In general, this is intended to be used to
     * determine when user focus has transitioned between two VR activities, or between a
     * VR activity and a 2D activity. This should be overridden instead of the above
     * onCurrentVrActivityChanged as that version is deprecated.</p>
     *
     * @param component the {@link ComponentName} of the VR activity or the 2D intent.
     * @param running2dInVr true if the component is a 2D component.
     * @param pid the process the component is running in.
