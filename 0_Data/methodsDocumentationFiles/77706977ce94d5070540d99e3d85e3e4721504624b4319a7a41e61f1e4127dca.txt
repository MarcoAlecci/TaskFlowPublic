     * Registers a download status listener for a {@link DownloadRequest} previously requested via
     * {@link #download(DownloadRequest)}. This callback will only be called as long as both this
     * app and the middleware are both running -- if either one stops, no further calls on the
     * provided {@link DownloadStatusListener} will be enqueued.
     *
     * If the middleware is not aware of the specified download request,
     * this method will throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
     *
     * If the operation encountered an error, the error code will be delivered via
     * {@link MbmsDownloadSessionCallback#onError}.
     *
     * Repeated calls to this method for the same {@link DownloadRequest} will replace the
     * previously registered listener.
     *
     * @param request The {@link DownloadRequest} that you want updates on.
     * @param executor The {@link Executor} on which calls to {@code listener } should be executed.
     * @param listener The listener that should be called when the middleware has information to
     *                 share on the status download.
