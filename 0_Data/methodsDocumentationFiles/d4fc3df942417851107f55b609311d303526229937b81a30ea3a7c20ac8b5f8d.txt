     * Stops listening for speech. Speech captured so far will be recognized as if the user had
     * stopped speaking at this point. Note that in the default case, this does not need to be
     * called, as the speech endpointer will automatically stop the recognizer listening when it
     * determines speech has completed. However, you can manipulate endpointer parameters directly
     * using the intent extras defined in {@link RecognizerIntent}, in which case you may sometimes
     * want to manually call this method to stop listening sooner. Please note that
     * {@link #setRecognitionListener(RecognitionListener)} should be called beforehand, otherwise
     * no notifications will be received.
