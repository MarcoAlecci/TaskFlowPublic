     * <p>Called to end the LockTask or screen pinning mode started by {@link #startLockTask()}.
     * This can only be called by activities that have called {@link #startLockTask()} previously.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the device is in LockTask mode that is not initially started
     * by this activity, then calling this method will not terminate the LockTask mode, but only
     * finish its own task. The device will remain in LockTask mode, until the activity which
     * started the LockTask mode calls this method, or until its whitelist authorization is revoked
     * by {@link DevicePolicyManager#setLockTaskPackages(ComponentName, String[])}.
