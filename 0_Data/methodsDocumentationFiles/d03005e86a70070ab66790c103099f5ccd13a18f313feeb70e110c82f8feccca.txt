     * Finds a {@link Preference} based on its key. If two {@link Preference}
     * share the same key (not recommended), the first to appear will be
     * returned (to retrieve the other preference with the same key, call this
     * method on the first preference). If this preference has the key, it will
     * not be returned.
     * <p>
     * This will recursively search for the preference into children that are
     * also {@link PreferenceGroup PreferenceGroups}.
     *
     * @param key The key of the preference to retrieve.
     * @return The {@link Preference} with the key, or null.
