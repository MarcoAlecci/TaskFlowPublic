     * Starts an activity to view calendar events in the managed profile.
     *
     * When this API is called, the system will attempt to start an activity
     * in the managed profile with an intent targeting the same caller package.
     * The intent will have its action set to
     * {@link CalendarContract#ACTION_VIEW_MANAGED_PROFILE_CALENDAR_EVENT} and contain extras
     * corresponding to the API's arguments. A calendar app intending to support
     * cross-profile events viewing should handle this intent, parse the arguments
     * and show the appropriate UI.
     *
     * @param context the context.
     * @param eventId the id of the event to be viewed. Will be put into {@link #EXTRA_EVENT_ID}
     *                field of the intent.
     * @param startMs the start time of the event in milliseconds since epoch.
     *                Will be put into {@link #EXTRA_EVENT_BEGIN_TIME} field of the intent.
     * @param endMs the end time of the event in milliseconds since epoch.
     *              Will be put into {@link #EXTRA_EVENT_END_TIME} field of the intent.
     * @param allDay if the event is an all-day event. Will be put into
     *               {@link #EXTRA_EVENT_ALL_DAY} field of the intent.
     * @param flags flags to be set on the intent via {@link Intent#setFlags}
     * @return {@code true} if the activity is started successfully. {@code false} otherwise.
