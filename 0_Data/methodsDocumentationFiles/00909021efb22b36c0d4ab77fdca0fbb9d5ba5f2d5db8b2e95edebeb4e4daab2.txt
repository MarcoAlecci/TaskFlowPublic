     * Returns a string representation of the method handle,
     * starting with the string {@code "MethodHandle"} and
     * ending with the string representation of the method handle's type.
     * In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:
     * <blockquote><pre>{@code
     * "MethodHandle" + type().toString()
     * }</pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * (<em>Note:</em>  Future releases of this API may add further information
     * to the string representation.
     * Therefore, the present syntax should not be parsed by applications.)
