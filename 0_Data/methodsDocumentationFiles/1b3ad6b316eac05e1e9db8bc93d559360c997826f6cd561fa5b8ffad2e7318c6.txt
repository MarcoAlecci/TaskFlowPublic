     * Helper version of saveLayer() that takes 4 values rather than a RectF.
     *
     * As of API Level API level {@value Build.VERSION_CODES#P} the only valid
     * {@code saveFlags} is {@link #ALL_SAVE_FLAG}.  All other flags are ignored.
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #saveLayer(float, float, float, float, Paint)} instead.
