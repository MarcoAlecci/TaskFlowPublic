     * Instructs the zygote to preload the default set of classes and resources. Returns
     * {@code true} if a preload was performed as a result of this call, and {@code false}
     * otherwise. The latter usually means that the zygote eagerly preloaded at startup
     * or due to a previous call to {@code preloadDefault}. Note that this call is synchronous.
