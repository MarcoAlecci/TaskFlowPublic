     * Create a listening, insecure RFCOMM Bluetooth socket with Service Record.
     * <p>The link key is not required to be authenticated, i.e the communication may be
     * vulnerable to Man In the Middle attacks. For Bluetooth 2.1 devices,
     * the link will be encrypted, as encryption is mandartory.
     * For legacy devices (pre Bluetooth 2.1 devices) the link will not
     * be encrypted. Use {@link #listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord}, if an
     * encrypted and authenticated communication channel is desired.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothServerSocket#accept} to retrieve incoming
     * connections from a listening {@link BluetoothServerSocket}.
     * <p>The system will assign an unused RFCOMM channel to listen on.
     * <p>The system will also register a Service Discovery
     * Protocol (SDP) record with the local SDP server containing the specified
     * UUID, service name, and auto-assigned channel. Remote Bluetooth devices
     * can use the same UUID to query our SDP server and discover which channel
     * to connect to. This SDP record will be removed when this socket is
     * closed, or if this application closes unexpectedly.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothDevice#createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord} to
     * connect to this socket from another device using the same {@link UUID}.
     *
     * @param name service name for SDP record
     * @param uuid uuid for SDP record
     * @return a listening RFCOMM BluetoothServerSocket
     * @throws IOException on error, for example Bluetooth not available, or insufficient
     * permissions, or channel in use.
