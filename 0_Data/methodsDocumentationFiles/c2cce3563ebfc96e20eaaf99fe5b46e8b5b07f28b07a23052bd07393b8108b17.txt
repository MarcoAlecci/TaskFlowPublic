     *  Enables a preset on the reverb.
     *  <p>The reverb PRESET_NONE disables any reverb from the current output but does not free the
     *  resources associated with the reverb. For an application to signal to the implementation
     *  to free the resources, it must call the release() method.
     * @param preset this must be one of the the preset constants defined in this class.
     * e.g. {@link #PRESET_SMALLROOM}
     * @throws IllegalStateException
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException
