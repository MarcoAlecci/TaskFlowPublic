     * Called to get the drawable to populate the Outline that defines its drawing area.
     * <p>
     * This method is called by the default {@link android.view.ViewOutlineProvider} to define
     * the outline of the View.
     * <p>
     * The default behavior defines the outline to be the bounding rectangle of 0 alpha.
     * Subclasses that wish to convey a different shape or alpha value must override this method.
