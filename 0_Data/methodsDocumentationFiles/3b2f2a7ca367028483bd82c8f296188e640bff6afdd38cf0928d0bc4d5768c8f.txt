     * Creates a ResourcesProvider from a resources table ({@code .arsc}) file descriptor.
     *
     * The file descriptor is duplicated and the original may be closed by the application at any
     * time without affecting the ResourcesProvider.
     *
     * <p>The resources table format is not an archive format and therefore cannot asset files
     * within itself. The assets provider can instead provide files that are potentially referenced
     * by path in the resources table.
     *
     * @param fileDescriptor the file descriptor of the resources table to load
     * @param offset The location within the file that the table starts. This must be 0 if length is
     *               {@link AssetFileDescriptor#UNKNOWN_LENGTH}.
     * @param length The number of bytes of the table, or {@link AssetFileDescriptor#UNKNOWN_LENGTH}
     *               if it extends to the end of the file.
     * @param assetsProvider the assets provider that overrides the loading of file-based resources
