     * This is called when a child activity of this one calls its
     * {@link #finish} method.  The default implementation simply calls
     * finish() on this activity (the parent), finishing the entire group.
     *
     * @param child The activity making the call.
     *
     * @see #finish
     * @deprecated Use {@link #finish()} instead.
