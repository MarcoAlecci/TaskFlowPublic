     * Given a set of subqueries, all of which are {@code SELECT} statements,
     * construct a query that returns the union of what those
     * subqueries return.
     * @param subQueries an array of SQL {@code SELECT} statements, all of
     *   which must have the same columns as the same positions in
     *   their results
     * @param sortOrder How to order the rows, formatted as an SQL
     *   {@code ORDER BY} clause (excluding the {@code ORDER BY} itself).  Passing
     *   null will use the default sort order, which may be unordered.
     * @param limit The limit clause, which applies to the entire union result set
     *
     * @return the resulting SQL {@code SELECT} statement
