     * Request the host application to create a new window. If the host
     * application chooses to honor this request, it should return {@code true} from
     * this method, create a new WebView to host the window, insert it into the
     * View system and send the supplied resultMsg message to its target with
     * the new WebView as an argument. If the host application chooses not to
     * honor the request, it should return {@code false} from this method. The default
     * implementation of this method does nothing and hence returns {@code false}.
     * <p>
     * Applications should typically not allow windows to be created when the
     * {@code isUserGesture} flag is false, as this may be an unwanted popup.
     * <p>
     * Applications should be careful how they display the new window: don't simply
     * overlay it over the existing WebView as this may mislead the user about which
     * site they are viewing. If your application displays the URL of the main page,
     * make sure to also display the URL of the new window in a similar fashion. If
     * your application does not display URLs, consider disallowing the creation of
     * new windows entirely.
     * <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> There is no trustworthy way to tell which page
     * requested the new window: the request might originate from a third-party iframe
     * inside the WebView.
     *
     * @param view The WebView from which the request for a new window
     *             originated.
     * @param isDialog {@code true} if the new window should be a dialog, rather than
     *                 a full-size window.
     * @param isUserGesture {@code true} if the request was initiated by a user gesture,
     *                      such as the user clicking a link.
     * @param resultMsg The message to send when once a new WebView has been
     *                  created. resultMsg.obj is a
     *                  {@link WebView.WebViewTransport} object. This should be
     *                  used to transport the new WebView, by calling
     *                  {@link WebView.WebViewTransport#setWebView(WebView)
     *                  WebView.WebViewTransport.setWebView(WebView)}.
     * @return This method should return {@code true} if the host application will
     *         create a new window, in which case resultMsg should be sent to
     *         its target. Otherwise, this method should return {@code false}. Returning
     *         {@code false} from this method but also sending resultMsg will result in
     *         undefined behavior.
