     * Attempt to connect to a remote device.
     * <p>This method will block until a connection is made or the connection
     * fails. If this method returns without an exception then this socket
     * is now connected.
     * <p>Creating new connections to
     * remote Bluetooth devices should not be attempted while device discovery
     * is in progress. Device discovery is a heavyweight procedure on the
     * Bluetooth adapter and will significantly slow a device connection.
     * Use {@link BluetoothAdapter#cancelDiscovery()} to cancel an ongoing
     * discovery. Discovery is not managed by the Activity,
     * but is run as a system service, so an application should always call
     * {@link BluetoothAdapter#cancelDiscovery()} even if it
     * did not directly request a discovery, just to be sure.
     * <p>{@link #close} can be used to abort this call from another thread.

     * @throws IOException on error, for example connection failure
