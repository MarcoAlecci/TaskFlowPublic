     * Registers an OnDataCaptureListener interface and specifies the rate at which the capture
     * should be updated as well as the type of capture requested.
     * <p>Call this method with a null listener to stop receiving the capture updates.
     * @param listener OnDataCaptureListener registered
     * @param rate rate in milliHertz at which the capture should be updated
     * @param waveform true if a waveform capture is requested: the onWaveFormDataCapture()
     * method will be called on the OnDataCaptureListener interface.
     * @param fft true if a frequency capture is requested: the onFftDataCapture() method will be
     * called on the OnDataCaptureListener interface.
     * @return {@link #SUCCESS} in case of success,
     * {@link #ERROR_NO_INIT} or {@link #ERROR_BAD_VALUE} in case of failure.
