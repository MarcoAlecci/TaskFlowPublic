     * Register to receive intent broadcasts, with the receiver optionally being
     * exposed to Instant Apps. See
     * {@link #registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter)} for more
     * information. By default Instant Apps cannot interact with receivers in other
     * applications, this allows you to expose a receiver that Instant Apps can
     * interact with.

     * <p>See {@link BroadcastReceiver} for more information on Intent broadcasts.

     * <p>As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH}, receivers
     * registered with this method will correctly respect the
     * {@link Intent#setPackage(String)} specified for an Intent being broadcast.
     * Prior to that, it would be ignored and delivered to all matching registered
     * receivers.  Be careful if using this for security.</p>
     *
     * @param receiver The BroadcastReceiver to handle the broadcast.
     * @param filter Selects the Intent broadcasts to be received.
     * @param flags Additional options for the receiver. May be 0 or

     *
     * @return The first sticky intent found that matches <var>filter</var>,
     *         or null if there are none.
