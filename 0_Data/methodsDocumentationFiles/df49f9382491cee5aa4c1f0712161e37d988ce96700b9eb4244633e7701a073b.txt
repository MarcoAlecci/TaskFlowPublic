             *      when "dark launched". When a TextClassifier is dark launched, it can suggest
             *      selection changes that should not be used to actually change the user's
             *      selection. Instead, the suggested selection is logged, compared with the user's
             *      selection interaction, and used to generate quality metrics for the
             *      TextClassifier. Not parceled.
