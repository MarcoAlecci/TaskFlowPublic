     * Returns true if this WindowInsets has nonzero stable insets.
     *
     * <p>The stable inset represents the area of a full-screen window that <b>may</b> be
     * partially or fully obscured by the system UI elements.  This value does not change
     * based on the visibility state of those elements; for example, if the status bar is
     * normally shown, but temporarily hidden, the stable inset will still provide the inset
     * associated with the status bar being shown.</p>
     *
     * @return true if any of the stable inset values are nonzero
     * @deprecated Use {@link #getInsetsIgnoringVisibility(int)} with {@link Type#systemBars()}
     * instead.
