     * Returns an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom {@code
     * double} values, each between zero (inclusive) and one
     * (exclusive).
     *
     * <p>A pseudorandom {@code double} value is generated as if it's the result
     * of calling the method {@link #nextDouble()}.
     *
     * @implNote This method is implemented to be equivalent to {@code
     * doubles(Long.MAX_VALUE)}.
