     * Gets or creates a ByteBuffer that contains the raw data of the current Allocation.
     * <p> If the Allocation is created with USAGE_IO_INPUT, the returned ByteBuffer
     * would contain the up-to-date data as READ ONLY.
     * For a 2D or 3D Allocation, the raw data maybe padded so that each row of
     * the Allocation has certain alignment. The size of each row including padding,
     * called stride, can be queried using the {@link #getStride()} method.
     *
     * Note: Operating on the ByteBuffer of a destroyed Allocation will triger errors.
     *
     * @return ByteBuffer The ByteBuffer associated with raw data pointer of the Allocation.
