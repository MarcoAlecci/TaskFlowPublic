     * Initializes this cipher with a key, a set of algorithm
     * parameters, and a source of randomness.
     *
     * <p>The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations:
     * encryption, decryption, key wrapping or  key unwrapping, depending
     * on the value of <code>opmode</code>.
     *
     * <p>If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters and
     * <code>params</code> is null, the underlying cipher implementation is
     * supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using
     * provider-specific default or random values) if it is being
     * initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an
     * <code>InvalidAlgorithmParameterException</code> if it is being
     * initialized for decryption or key unwrapping.
     * The generated parameters can be retrieved using
     * {@link #getParameters() getParameters} or
     * {@link #getIV() getIV} (if the parameter is an IV).
     *
     * <p>If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be
     * derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable
     * provider-specific default values, initialization will
     * necessarily fail.
     *
     * <p>If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme)
     * requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get
     * them from <code>random</code>.
     *
     * <p>Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all
     * previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is
     * equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing
     * it.
     *
     * @param opmode the operation mode of this cipher (this is one of the
     * following:
     * <code>ENCRYPT_MODE</code>, <code>DECRYPT_MODE</code>,
     * <code>WRAP_MODE</code> or <code>UNWRAP_MODE</code>)
     * @param key the encryption key
     * @param params the algorithm parameters
     * @param random the source of randomness
     *
     * @exception InvalidKeyException if the given key is inappropriate for
     * initializing this cipher, or its keysize exceeds the maximum allowable
     * keysize (as determined from the configured jurisdiction policy files).
     * @exception InvalidAlgorithmParameterException if the given algorithm
     * parameters are inappropriate for this cipher,
     * or this cipher requires
     * algorithm parameters and <code>params</code> is null, or the given
     * algorithm parameters imply a cryptographic strength that would exceed
     * the legal limits (as determined from the configured jurisdiction
     * policy files).
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if (@code opmode} is
     * {@code WRAP_MODE} or {@code UNWRAP_MODE} but the mode is not implemented
     * by the underlying {@code CipherSpi}.
