     * Return the opacity/transparency of this Drawable.  The returned value is
     * one of the abstract format constants in
     * {@link android.graphics.PixelFormat}:
     * {@link android.graphics.PixelFormat#UNKNOWN},
     * {@link android.graphics.PixelFormat#TRANSLUCENT},
     * {@link android.graphics.PixelFormat#TRANSPARENT}, or
     * {@link android.graphics.PixelFormat#OPAQUE}.
     *
     * <p>An OPAQUE drawable is one that draws all all content within its bounds, completely
     * covering anything behind the drawable. A TRANSPARENT drawable is one that draws nothing
     * within its bounds, allowing everything behind it to show through. A TRANSLUCENT drawable
     * is a drawable in any other state, where the drawable will draw some, but not all,
     * of the content within its bounds and at least some content behind the drawable will
     * be visible. If the visibility of the drawable's contents cannot be determined, the
     * safest/best return value is TRANSLUCENT.
     *
     * <p>Generally a Drawable should be as conservative as possible with the
     * value it returns.  For example, if it contains multiple child drawables
     * and only shows one of them at a time, if only one of the children is
     * TRANSLUCENT and the others are OPAQUE then TRANSLUCENT should be
     * returned.  You can use the method {@link #resolveOpacity} to perform a
     * standard reduction of two opacities to the appropriate single output.
     *
     * <p>Note that the returned value does not necessarily take into account a
     * custom alpha or color filter that has been applied by the client through
     * the {@link #setAlpha} or {@link #setColorFilter} methods. Some subclasses,
     * such as {@link BitmapDrawable}, {@link ColorDrawable}, and {@link GradientDrawable},
     * do account for the value of {@link #setAlpha}, but the general behavior is dependent
     * upon the implementation of the subclass.
     *

     * @return int The opacity class of the Drawable.
