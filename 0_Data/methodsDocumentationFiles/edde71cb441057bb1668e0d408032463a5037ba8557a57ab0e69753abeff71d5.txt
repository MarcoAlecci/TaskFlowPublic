         * Sets an overlay that will be drawn on the top of the magnifier.
         * In general, the overlay should not be opaque, in order to let the magnified
         * content be partially visible in the magnifier. The default overlay is {@code null}
         * (no overlay). As an example, TextView applies a white {@link ColorDrawable}
         * overlay with 5% alpha, aiming to make the magnifier distinguishable when shown in dark
         * application regions. To disable the overlay, the parameter should be set
         * to {@code null}. If not null, the overlay will be automatically redrawn
         * when the drawable is invalidated. To achieve this, the magnifier will set a new
         * {@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable.Callback} for the overlay drawable,
         * so keep in mind that any existing one set by the application will be lost.
         * @param overlay the overlay to be drawn on top
