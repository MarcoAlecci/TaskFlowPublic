     * Returns the next cursor position in the run.
     *
     * This avoids placing the cursor between surrogates, between characters that form conjuncts,
     * between base characters and combining marks, or within a reordering cluster.
     *
     * <p>
     * ContextStart, contextEnd, and offset are relative to the start of
     * text.  The context is the shaping context for cursor movement, generally
     * the bounds of the metric span enclosing the cursor in the direction of
     * movement.
     *
     * <p>
     * If cursorOpt is {@link #CURSOR_AT} and the offset is not a valid cursor position, this
     * returns -1.  Otherwise this will never return a value before contextStart or after
     * contextEnd.
     *
     * @param text the text
     * @param contextStart the start of the context
     * @param contextEnd the end of the context
     * @param isRtl true if the paragraph context is RTL, otherwise false
     * @param offset the cursor position to move from
     * @param cursorOpt how to move the cursor
     * @return the offset of the next position, or -1
