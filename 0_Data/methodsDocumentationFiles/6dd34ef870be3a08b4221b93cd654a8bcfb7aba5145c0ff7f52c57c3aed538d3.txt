     * Sets the center of the light source. The light source point controls the directionality
     * and shape of shadows rendered by RenderNode Z & elevation.
     *
     * <p>The platform's recommendation is to set lightX to 'displayWidth / 2f - windowLeft', set
     * lightY to 0 - windowTop, lightZ set to 600dp, and lightRadius to 800dp.
     *
     * <p>The light source should be setup both as part of initial configuration, and whenever
     * the window moves to ensure the light source stays anchored in display space instead
     * of in window space.
     *
     * <p>This must be set at least once along with {@link #setLightSourceAlpha(float, float)}
     * before shadows will work.
     *
     * @param lightX      The X position of the light source
     * @param lightY      The Y position of the light source
     * @param lightZ      The Z position of the light source. Must be >= 0.
     * @param lightRadius The radius of the light source. Smaller radius will have sharper edges,
     *                    larger radius will have softer shadows.
