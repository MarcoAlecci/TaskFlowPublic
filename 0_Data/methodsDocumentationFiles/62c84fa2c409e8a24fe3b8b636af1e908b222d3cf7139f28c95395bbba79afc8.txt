             * storage areas while the user is locked.
             * <p>
             * When a user is locked, credential protected storage is
             * unavailable, and files stored in these locations appear to not
             * exist, which can result in subtle app bugs if they assume default
             * behaviors or empty states. Instead, apps should store data needed
             * while a user is locked under device protected storage areas.
