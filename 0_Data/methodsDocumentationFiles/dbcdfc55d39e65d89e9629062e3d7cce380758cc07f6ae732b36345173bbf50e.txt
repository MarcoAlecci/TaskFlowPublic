     * When {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#FLAG_REQUEST_TOUCH_EXPLORATION_MODE} is enabled, this
     * function requests that touch interactions starting in the specified region of the screen
     * bypass the touch explorer and go straight to the view hierarchy. There can only be one touch
     * exploration passthrough region per display. Requesting a new touch explorationpassthrough
     * region clears the existing one. To disable this passthrough and return to the original
     * behavior, pass in an empty region. When {@link
     * AccessibilityServiceInfo#FLAG_REQUEST_TOUCH_EXPLORATION_MODE} is disabled this function has
     * no effect.
     *
     * @param displayId The display on which to set this region.
     * @param region the region of the screen .
