     * Determine whether the calling process of an IPC you are handling has been
     * granted a particular permission.  This is basically the same as calling
     * {@link #checkPermission(String, int, int)} with the pid and uid returned
     * by {@link android.os.Binder#getCallingPid} and
     * {@link android.os.Binder#getCallingUid}.  One important difference
     * is that if you are not currently processing an IPC, this function
     * will always fail.  This is done to protect against accidentally
     * leaking permissions; you can use {@link #checkCallingOrSelfPermission}
     * to avoid this protection.
     *
     * @param permission The name of the permission being checked.
     *
     * @return {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_GRANTED} if the calling
     * pid/uid is allowed that permission, or
     * {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_DENIED} if it is not.
