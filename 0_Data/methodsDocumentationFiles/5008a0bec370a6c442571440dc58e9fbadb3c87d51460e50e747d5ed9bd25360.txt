     * {@link #bindProcessToNetwork}, or {@code null} if no {@link Network} is explicitly bound.

     * @return {@code Network} to which this process is bound, or {@code null}.
     * @deprecated Using this function can lead to other functions throwing
     *             {@link IllegalStateException}.  Use {@link #getBoundNetworkForProcess} instead.
     *             {@code getBoundNetworkForProcess} is a direct replacement.
