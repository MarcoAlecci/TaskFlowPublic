     * Returns a bitmap from the specified subset of the source
     * bitmap. The new bitmap may be the same object as source, or a copy may
     * have been made. It is initialized with the same density and color space
     * as the original bitmap.
     *
     * @param source   The bitmap we are subsetting
     * @param x        The x coordinate of the first pixel in source
     * @param y        The y coordinate of the first pixel in source
     * @param width    The number of pixels in each row
     * @param height   The number of rows
     * @return A copy of a subset of the source bitmap or the source bitmap itself.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the x, y, width, height values are
     *         outside of the dimensions of the source bitmap, or width is <= 0,
     *         or height is <= 0
