     * Inserts an {@link IBinder} value into the mapping of this Bundle, replacing
     * any existing value for the given key.  Either key or value may be null.
     *
     * <p class="note">You should be very careful when using this function.  In many
     * places where Bundles are used (such as inside of Intent objects), the Bundle
     * can live longer inside of another process than the process that had originally
     * created it.  In that case, the IBinder you supply here will become invalid
     * when your process goes away, and no longer usable, even if a new process is
     * created for you later on.</p>

     * @param key a String, or null
     * @param value an IBinder object, or null
