     * Map this record to a MIME type, or return null if it cannot be mapped.<p>
     * Currently this method considers all {@link #TNF_MIME_MEDIA} records to
     * be MIME records, as well as some {@link #TNF_WELL_KNOWN} records such as
     * {@link #RTD_TEXT}. If this is a MIME record then the MIME type as string
     * is returned, otherwise null is returned.<p>
     * This method does not perform validation that the MIME type is
     * actually valid. It always attempts to
     * return a string containing the type if this is a MIME record.<p>
     * The returned MIME type will by normalized to lower-case using
     * {@link Intent#normalizeMimeType}.<p>
     * The MIME payload can be obtained using {@link #getPayload}.
     *
     * @return MIME type as a string, or null if this is not a MIME record
