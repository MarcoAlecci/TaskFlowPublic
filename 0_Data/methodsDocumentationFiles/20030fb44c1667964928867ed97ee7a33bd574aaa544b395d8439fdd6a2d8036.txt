     * Connects to remote device.
     *
     * Currently, the system supports only 1 connection. So, in case of the
     * second connection, this implementation will disconnect already connected
     * device automatically and will process the new one.
     *
     * @param device a remote device we want connect to
     * @return <code>true</code> if command has been issued successfully; <code>false</code>
     * otherwise; upon completion HFP sends {@link #ACTION_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGED} intent.
