         * Generic callback for passing updates to vendor-specific parameter values.
         * The framework does not interpret the parameters, they are passed
         * in an opaque manner between a vendor application and HAL.
         *
         * It's up to the HAL implementation if and how to implement this callback,
         * as long as it obeys the prefix rule. In particular, only selected keys
         * may be notified this way. However, setParameters must not trigger
         * this callback, while an internal event can change parameters
         * asynchronously.
         *
         * @param parameters Vendor-specific key-value pairs.
