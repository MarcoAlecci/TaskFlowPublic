     * <p>Ask that a new assistant activity be started.  This will create a new task in the
     * in activity manager: this means that
     * {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK}
     * will be set for you to make it a new task.</p>
     *
     * <p>The newly started activity will be displayed on top of other activities in the system
     * in a new layer that is not affected by multi-window mode.  Tasks started from this activity
     * will go into the normal activity layer and not this new layer.</p>
     *
     * <p>By default, the system will create a window for the UI for this session.  If you are using
     * an assistant activity instead, then you can disable the window creation by calling
     * {@link #setUiEnabled} in {@link #onPrepareShow(Bundle, int)}.</p>
