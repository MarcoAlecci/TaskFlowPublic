     * Returns details about the currently active default data network. When
     * connected, this network is the default route for outgoing connections.
     * You should always check {@link NetworkInfo#isConnected()} before initiating
     * network traffic. This may return {@code null} when there is no default
     * network.
     * Note that if the default network is a VPN, this method will return the
     * NetworkInfo for one of its underlying networks instead, or null if the
     * VPN agent did not specify any. Apps interested in learning about VPNs
     * should use {@link #getNetworkInfo(android.net.Network)} instead.
     *
     * @return a {@link NetworkInfo} object for the current default network
     *        or {@code null} if no default network is currently active
     * @deprecated See {@link NetworkInfo}.
