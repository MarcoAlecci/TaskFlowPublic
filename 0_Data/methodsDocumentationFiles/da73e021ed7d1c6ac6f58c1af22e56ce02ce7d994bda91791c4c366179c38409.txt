     * Whether to add the given type to the list of types to exclude from this
     * transition. The <code>exclude</code> parameter specifies whether the target
     * type should be added to or removed from the excluded list.
     *
     * <p>Excluding targets is a general mechanism for allowing transitions to run on
     * a view hierarchy while skipping target views that should not be part of
     * the transition. For example, you may want to avoid animating children
     * of a specific ListView or Spinner. Views can be excluded either by their
     * id, or by their instance reference, or by the Class of that view
     * (eg, {@link Spinner}).</p>
