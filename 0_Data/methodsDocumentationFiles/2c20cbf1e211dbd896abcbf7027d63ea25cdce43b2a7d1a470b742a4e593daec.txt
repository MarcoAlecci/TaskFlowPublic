     * Write remaining data to the output stream.  If there is no output stream,
     * this function does nothing. Any currently open objects (i.e. ones that
     * have not had {@link #end(long)} called for them will not be written).  Whether this
     * writes objects that are closed if there are remaining open objects is
     * undefined (current implementation does not write it, future ones will).
     * For now, can either call {@link #getBytes()} or {@link #flush()}, but not both.
