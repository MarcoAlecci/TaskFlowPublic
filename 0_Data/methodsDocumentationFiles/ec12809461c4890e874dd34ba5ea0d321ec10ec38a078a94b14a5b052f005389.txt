     * Returns the camcorder profile for the given camera at the given
     * quality level.
     *
     * Quality levels QUALITY_LOW, QUALITY_HIGH are guaranteed to be supported, while
     * other levels may or may not be supported. The supported levels can be checked using
     * {@link #hasProfile(int, int)}.
     * QUALITY_LOW refers to the lowest quality available, while QUALITY_HIGH refers to
     * the highest quality available.
     * QUALITY_LOW/QUALITY_HIGH have to match one of qcif, cif, 480p, 720p, 1080p or 2160p.
     * E.g. if the device supports 480p, 720p, 1080p and 2160p, then low is 480p and high is
     * 2160p.
     *
     * The same is true for time lapse quality levels, i.e. QUALITY_TIME_LAPSE_LOW,
     * QUALITY_TIME_LAPSE_HIGH are guaranteed to be supported and have to match one of
     * qcif, cif, 480p, 720p, 1080p, or 2160p.
     *
     * For high speed quality levels, they may or may not be supported. If a subset of the levels
     * are supported, QUALITY_HIGH_SPEED_LOW and QUALITY_HIGH_SPEED_HIGH are guaranteed to be
     * supported and have to match one of 480p, 720p, or 1080p.
     *
     * A camcorder recording session with higher quality level usually has higher output
     * bit rate, better video and/or audio recording quality, larger video frame
     * resolution and higher audio sampling rate, etc, than those with lower quality
     * level.

     * @param cameraId the id for the camera
     * @param quality the target quality level for the camcorder profile.
