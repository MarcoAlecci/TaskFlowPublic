     * Returns the child {@link Call} in a generic conference that is currently active.
     *
     * A "generic conference" is the mechanism used to support two simultaneous calls on a device
     * in CDMA networks. It is effectively equivalent to having one call active and one call on hold
     * in GSM or IMS calls. This method returns the currently active call.
     *
     * In a generic conference, the network exposes the conference to us as a single call, and we
     * switch between talking to the two participants using a CDMA flash command. Since the network
     * exposes no additional information about the call, the only way we know which caller we're
     * currently talking to is by keeping track of the flash commands that we've sent to the
     * network.
     *
     * For calls that are not generic conferences, or when the generic conference has more than
     * 2 children, returns {@code null}.
     * @see Details#PROPERTY_GENERIC_CONFERENCE
     * @return The active child call.
