         * Provide the graphic producer a transform hint if the layer and its children are
         * in an orientation different from the display's orientation. The caller is responsible
         * for clearing this transform hint if the layer is no longer in a fixed orientation.
         *
         * The transform hint is used to prevent allocating a buffer of different size when a
         * layer is rotated. The producer can choose to consume the hint and allocate the buffer
         * with the same size.
