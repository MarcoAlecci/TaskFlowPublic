         * Renders a page to a bitmap.
         * <p>
         * You may optionally specify a rectangular clip in the bitmap bounds. No rendering
         * outside the clip will be performed, hence it is your responsibility to initialize
         * the bitmap outside the clip.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * You may optionally specify a matrix to transform the content from page coordinates
         * which are in points (1/72") to bitmap coordinates which are in pixels. If this
         * matrix is not provided this method will apply a transformation that will fit the
         * whole page to the destination clip if provided or the destination bitmap if no
         * clip is provided.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * The clip and transformation are useful for implementing tile rendering where the
         * destination bitmap contains a portion of the image, for example when zooming.
         * Another useful application is for printing where the size of the bitmap holding
         * the page is too large and a client can render the page in stripes.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * <strong>Note: </strong> The destination bitmap format must be
         * {@link Config#ARGB_8888 ARGB}.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * <strong>Note: </strong> The optional transformation matrix must be affine as per
         * {@link android.graphics.Matrix#isAffine() Matrix.isAffine()}. Hence, you can specify
         * rotation, scaling, translation but not a perspective transformation.
