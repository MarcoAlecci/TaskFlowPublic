     * <p>This function can be called for logical multi-camera devices, which are devices that have
     * REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA capability and calls to {@link
     * CameraCharacteristics#getPhysicalCameraIds} return a non-empty set of physical devices that
     * are backing the logical camera.</p>
     *
     * <p>If one or more streams from the underlying physical cameras were requested by the
     * corresponding capture request, this function returns the result metadata for those physical
     * cameras. Otherwise, an empty map is returned.</p>

     * @return unmodifiable map between physical camera ids and their capture result metadata
