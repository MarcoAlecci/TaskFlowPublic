     * Called when a generic motion event was not handled by any of the
     * views inside of the activity.
     * <p>
     * Generic motion events describe joystick movements, mouse hovers, track pad
     * touches, scroll wheel movements and other input events.  The
     * {@link MotionEvent#getSource() source} of the motion event specifies
     * the class of input that was received.  Implementations of this method
     * must examine the bits in the source before processing the event.
     * The following code example shows how this is done.
     * </p><p>
     * Generic motion events with source class
     * {@link android.view.InputDevice#SOURCE_CLASS_POINTER}
     * are delivered to the view under the pointer.  All other generic motion events are
     * delivered to the focused view.
     * </p><p>
     * See {@link View#onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent)} for an example of how to
     * handle this event.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param event The generic motion event being processed.
     *
     * @return Return true if you have consumed the event, false if you haven't.
     * The default implementation always returns false.
