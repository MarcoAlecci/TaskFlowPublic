     * Unmaps a buffer previously returned by {@link #map(int, int, int)}. This will immediately
     * release the backing memory of the ByteBuffer, invalidating all references to it. Only
     * call this method if there are no duplicates of the ByteBuffer in use and don't
     * access the ByteBuffer after calling this method.
