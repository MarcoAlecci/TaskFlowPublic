     * Enable or disable special cache behavior that treats this directory and
     * its contents as an entire group.
     * <p>
     * When enabled and this directory is considered for automatic deletion by
     * the OS, all contained files will either be deleted together, or not at
     * all. This is useful when you have a directory that contains several
     * related metadata files that depend on each other, such as movie file and
     * a subtitle file.
     * <p>
     * When enabled, the <em>newest</em> {@link File#lastModified()} value of
     * any contained files is considered the modified time of the entire
     * directory.
     * <p>
     * This behavior can only be set on a directory, and it applies recursively
     * to all contained files and directories.
