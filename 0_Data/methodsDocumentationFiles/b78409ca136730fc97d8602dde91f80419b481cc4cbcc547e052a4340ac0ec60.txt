     * Counts packets across all network interfaces, and always increases
     * monotonically since device boot. Statistics are measured at the network
     * layer, so they include both TCP and UDP usage.
     * <p>
     * Before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN_MR2}, this may return
     * {@link #UNSUPPORTED} on devices where statistics aren't available.
     * <p>
     * Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N} this will only
     * report traffic statistics for the calling UID. It will return
     * {@link #UNSUPPORTED} for all other UIDs for privacy reasons. To access
     * historical network statistics belonging to other UIDs, use
     * {@link NetworkStatsManager}.
