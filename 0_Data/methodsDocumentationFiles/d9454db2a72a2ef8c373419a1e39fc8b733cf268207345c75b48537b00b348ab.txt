     * Called by an application that is administering the device to set the length of the password
     * history. After setting this, the user will not be able to enter a new password that is the
     * same as any password in the history. Note that the current password will remain until the
     * user has set a new one, so the change does not take place immediately. To prompt the user for
     * a new password, use {@link #ACTION_SET_NEW_PASSWORD} or
     * {@link #ACTION_SET_NEW_PARENT_PROFILE_PASSWORD} after setting this value.
     * <p>
     * On devices not supporting {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_SECURE_LOCK_SCREEN} feature, the
     * password history length is always 0.
     * <p>
     * The calling device admin must have requested
     * {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_LIMIT_PASSWORD} to be able to call this method; if it has
     * not, a security exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to set restrictions on the parent
     * profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param length The new desired length of password history. A value of 0 means there is no
     *            restriction.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not an active administrator or {@code admin}
     *             does not use {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_LIMIT_PASSWORD}
