     * {@code SystemUpdatePolicy} object. This is a convenience method for system update clients
     * so they can instantiate this policy at any given time and find out what to do with incoming

     * Normally the system update clients will query the current installation option by calling this
     * method with the current timestamp, and act on the returned option until its effective time
     * lapses. It can then query the latest option using a new timestamp. It should also listen
     * for {@code DevicePolicyManager#ACTION_SYSTEM_UPDATE_POLICY_CHANGED} broadcast, in case the
     * whole policy is updated.
