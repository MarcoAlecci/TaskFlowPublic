     * Return a color-int from red, green, blue components.
     * The alpha component is implicitly 255 (fully opaque).
     * These component values should be \([0..255]\), but there is no
     * range check performed, so if they are out of range, the
     * returned color is undefined.
     *
     * @param red  Red component \([0..255]\) of the color
     * @param green Green component \([0..255]\) of the color
     * @param blue  Blue component \([0..255]\) of the color
