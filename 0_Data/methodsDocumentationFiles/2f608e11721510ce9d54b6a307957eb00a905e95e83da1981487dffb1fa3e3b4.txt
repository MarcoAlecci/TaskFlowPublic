     * Starts the animation from the first frame, looping if necessary. This method has no effect
     * if the animation is running.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> Do not call this in the
     * {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate} method of your activity, because
     * the {@link AnimationDrawable} is not yet fully attached to the window.
     * If you want to play the animation immediately without requiring
     * interaction, then you might want to call it from the
     * {@link android.app.Activity#onWindowFocusChanged} method in your
     * activity, which will get called when Android brings your window into
     * focus.
