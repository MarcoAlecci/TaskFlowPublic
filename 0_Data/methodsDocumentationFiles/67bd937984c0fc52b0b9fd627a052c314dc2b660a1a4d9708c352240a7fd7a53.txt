     * Adds child transition to this set. The order in which this child transition
     * is added relative to other child transitions that are added, in addition to
     * the {@link #getOrdering() ordering} property, determines the
     * order in which the transitions are started.
     *
     * <p>If this transitionSet has a {@link #getDuration() duration},
     * {@link #getInterpolator() interpolator}, {@link #getPropagation() propagation delay},
     * {@link #getPathMotion() path motion}, or
     * {@link #setEpicenterCallback(EpicenterCallback) epicenter callback}
     * set on it, the child transition will inherit the values that are set.
     * Transitions are assumed to have a maximum of one transitionSet parent.</p>

     * @param transition A non-null child transition to be added to this set.
