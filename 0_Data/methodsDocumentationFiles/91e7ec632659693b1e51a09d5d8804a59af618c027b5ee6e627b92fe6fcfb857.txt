     * Creates a monotone cubic spline from a given set of control points.
     *
     * The spline is guaranteed to pass through each control point exactly.
     * Moreover, assuming the control points are monotonic (Y is non-decreasing or
     * non-increasing) then the interpolated values will also be monotonic.
     *
     * This function uses the Fritsch-Carlson method for computing the spline parameters.

     *
     * @param x The X component of the control points, strictly increasing.
     * @param y The Y component of the control points, monotonic.
     * @return
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the X or Y arrays are null, have
     * different lengths or have fewer than 2 values.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the control points are not monotonic.
