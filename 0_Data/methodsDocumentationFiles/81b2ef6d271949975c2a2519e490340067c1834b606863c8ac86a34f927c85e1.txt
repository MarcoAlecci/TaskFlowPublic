     * that the hub supports a sleep mode in which the power draw is
     * lower than the power consumed when the hub is actively
     * processing. As a guideline, assume that the hub should be
     * able to enter sleep mode if it knows reliably on completion
     * of some task that the next interrupt/scheduled work item is
     * at least 250 milliseconds later.
