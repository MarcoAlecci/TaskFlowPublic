     * Obtains an instance of {@code YearMonth} from a temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a year-month based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code YearMonth}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion extracts the {@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} and
     * {@link ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR MONTH_OF_YEAR} fields.
     * The extraction is only permitted if the temporal object has an ISO
     * chronology, or can be converted to a {@code LocalDate}.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code YearMonth::from}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to convert, not null
     * @return the year-month, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to a {@code YearMonth}
