     * Asks the service to handle an "augmented" autofill request.
     *
     * <p>This method is called when the "stantard" autofill service cannot handle a request, which
     * typically occurs when:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Service does not recognize what should be autofilled.
     *   <li>Service does not have data to fill the request.
     *   <li>Service blacklisted that app (or activity) for autofill.
     *   <li>App disabled itself for autofill.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Differently from the standard autofill workflow, on augmented autofill the service is
     * responsible to generate the autofill UI and request the Android system to autofill the
     * activity when the user taps an action in that UI (through the
     * {@link FillController#autofill(List)} method).
     *
     * <p>The service <b>MUST</b> call {@link
     * FillCallback#onSuccess(android.service.autofill.augmented.FillResponse)} as soon as possible,
     * passing {@code null} when it cannot fulfill the request.
     * @param request the request to handle.
     * @param cancellationSignal signal for observing cancellation requests. The system will use
     *     this to notify you that the fill result is no longer needed and you should stop
     *     handling this fill request in order to save resources.
     * @param controller object used to interact with the autofill system.
     * @param callback object used to notify the result of the request. Service <b>must</b> call
     * {@link FillCallback#onSuccess(android.service.autofill.augmented.FillResponse)}.
