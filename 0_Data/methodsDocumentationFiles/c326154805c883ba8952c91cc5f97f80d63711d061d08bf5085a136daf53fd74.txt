     * Gets the node bounds in the viewParent's coordinates.
     * {@link #getParent()} does not represent the source's viewParent.
     * Instead it represents the result of {@link View#getParentForAccessibility()},
     * which returns the closest ancestor where {@link View#isImportantForAccessibility()} is true.
     * So this method is not reliable.
     * <p>
     * When magnification is enabled, the bounds in parent are also scaled up by magnification
     * scale. For example, it returns Rect(20, 20, 200, 200) for original bounds
     * Rect(10, 10, 100, 100), when the magnification scale is 2.
     * <p/>
     *
     * @param outBounds The output node bounds.
     * @deprecated Use {@link #getBoundsInScreen(Rect)} instead.
