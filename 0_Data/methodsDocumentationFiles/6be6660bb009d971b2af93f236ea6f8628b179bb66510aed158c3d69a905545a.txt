     * Turns off Bluetooth LE which was earlier turned on by calling enableBLE().
     *
     * <p> If the internal Adapter state is STATE_BLE_ON, this would trigger the transition
     * to STATE_OFF and completely shut-down Bluetooth
     *
     * <p> If the Adapter state is STATE_ON, This would unregister the existance of
     * special Bluetooth LE application and hence the further turning off of Bluetooth
     * from UI would ensure the complete turn-off of Bluetooth rather than staying back
     * BLE only state
     *
     * <p>This is an asynchronous call: it will return immediately, and
     * clients should listen for {@link #ACTION_BLE_STATE_CHANGED}
     * to be notified of subsequent adapter state changes If this call returns
     * true, then the adapter state will immediately transition from {@link
     * #STATE_ON} to {@link #STATE_TURNING_OFF}, and some time
     * later transition to either {@link #STATE_BLE_ON} or {@link
     * #STATE_OFF} based on the existance of the further Always BLE ON enabled applications
     * If this call returns false then there was an
     * immediate problem that will prevent the QAdapter from being turned off -
     * such as the QAadapter already being turned off.
