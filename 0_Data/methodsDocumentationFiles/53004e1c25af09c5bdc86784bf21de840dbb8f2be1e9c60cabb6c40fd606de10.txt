     * Set the rendering mode. When renderMode is
     * RENDERMODE_CONTINUOUSLY, the renderer is called
     * repeatedly to re-render the scene. When renderMode
     * is RENDERMODE_WHEN_DIRTY, the renderer only rendered when the surface
     * is created, or when {@link #requestRender} is called. Defaults to RENDERMODE_CONTINUOUSLY.
     * <p>
     * Using RENDERMODE_WHEN_DIRTY can improve battery life and overall system performance
     * by allowing the GPU and CPU to idle when the view does not need to be updated.
     * <p>
     * This method can only be called after {@link #setRenderer(Renderer)}
