     * Control inclusion of debugging help for mismatched
     * calls to {@link Context#registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter)
     * Context.registerReceiver()}.
     * If called with true, before given to registerReceiver(), then the
     * callstack of the following {@link Context#unregisterReceiver(BroadcastReceiver)
     * Context.unregisterReceiver()} call is retained, to be printed if a later
     * incorrect unregister call is made.  Note that doing this requires retaining
     * information about the BroadcastReceiver for the lifetime of the app,
     * resulting in a leak -- this should only be used for debugging.
