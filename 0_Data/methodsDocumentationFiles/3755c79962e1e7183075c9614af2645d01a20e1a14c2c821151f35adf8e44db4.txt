     * Starts a recovery session and returns a blob with proof of recovery secret possession.
     * The method generates a symmetric key for a session, which trusted remote device can use to
     * return recovery key.
     *
     * @param rootCertificateAlias The alias of the root certificate that is already in the Android
     *     OS. The root certificate will be used for validating {@code verifierCertPath}.
     * @param verifierCertPath The certificate path used to create the recovery blob on the source
     *     device. Keystore will verify the certificate path by using the root of trust.
     * @param vaultParams Must match the parameters in the corresponding field in the recovery blob.
     *     Used to limit number of guesses.
     * @param vaultChallenge Data passed from server for this recovery session and used to prevent
     *     replay attacks.
     * @param secrets Secrets provided by user, the method only uses type and secret fields.
     * @return The binary blob with recovery claim. It is encrypted with verifierPublicKey
     * and contains a proof of user secrets possession, session symmetric
     *     key and parameters necessary to identify the counter with the number of failed recovery
     *     attempts.
     * @throws CertificateException if the {@code verifierCertPath} is invalid.
     * @throws InternalRecoveryServiceException if an unexpected error occurred in the recovery
     *     service.
