     * Copy from the Allocation into a byte array. This variant is type checked
     * and will generate exceptions if the Allocation's {@link
     * android.renderscript.Element} is neither an 8 bit integer nor a vector of 8 bit
     * integers {@link android.renderscript.Element.DataType}.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation does not have Vec3 Elements, then the size of the
     * array in bytes must be at least the size of the Allocation {@link
     * #getBytesSize getBytesSize()}.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation has Vec3 Elements and {@link #setAutoPadding AutoPadding}
     * is disabled, then the size of the array in bytes must be at least the size
     * of the Allocation {@link #getBytesSize getBytesSize()}. The padding bytes for
     * the cells will be part of the array.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation has Vec3 Elements and {@link #setAutoPadding AutoPadding}
     * is enabled, then the size of the array in bytes must be at least 3/4 the size
     * of the Allocation {@link #getBytesSize getBytesSize()}. The padding bytes for
     * the cells must not be part of the array.
     *
     * @param d The array to be set from the Allocation.
