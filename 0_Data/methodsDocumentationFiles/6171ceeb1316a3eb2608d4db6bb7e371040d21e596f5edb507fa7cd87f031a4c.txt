     * Perform a detailed internal check on a {@link Uri} to determine if a UID
     * is able to access it with specific mode flags.
     * <p>
     * This method is typically used when the provider implements more dynamic
     * access controls that cannot be expressed with {@code <path-permission>}
     * style static rules.
     * <p>
     * Because validation of these dynamic access controls has significant
     * system health impact, this feature is only available to providers that
     * are built into the system.

     * @param uri the {@link Uri} to perform an access check on.
     * @param uid the UID to check the permission for.
     * @param modeFlags the access flags to use for the access check, such as
     *            {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION}.
     * @return {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_GRANTED} if access is allowed,
     *         otherwise {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_DENIED}.
