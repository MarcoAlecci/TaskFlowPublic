     * addition to displaying it on the screen.  After one invocation, the
     * callback is cleared. This method can be called any time, even when
     * preview is live.  Any other preview callbacks are overridden.</p>
     *
     * <p>If you are using the preview data to create video or still images,
     * strongly consider using {@link android.media.MediaActionSound} to
     * properly indicate image capture or recording start/stop to the user.</p>
