     * Continues a multi-part update of the Additional Authentication
     * Data (AAD).
     * <p>
     * Calls to this method provide AAD to the cipher when operating in
     * modes such as AEAD (GCM/CCM).  If this cipher is operating in
     * either GCM or CCM mode, all AAD must be supplied before beginning
     * operations on the ciphertext (via the {@code update} and {@code
     * doFinal} methods).
     * <p>
     * All {@code src.remaining()} bytes starting at
     * {@code src.position()} are processed.
     * Upon return, the input buffer's position will be equal
     * to its limit; its limit will not have changed.
     *
     * @param src the buffer containing the AAD
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the {@code src ByteBuffer}
     * is null
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this cipher is in a wrong state
     * (e.g., has not been initialized), does not accept AAD, or if
     * operating in either GCM or CCM mode and one of the {@code update}
     * methods has already been called for the active
     * encryption/decryption operation
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the corresponding method
     * in the {@code CipherSpi} has not been overridden by an
     * implementation
