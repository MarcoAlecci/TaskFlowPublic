     * Sets the mode for determining whether this view is considered important for autofill.
     *
     * <p>The platform determines the importance for autofill automatically but you
     * can use this method to customize the behavior. For example:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li>When the view contents is irrelevant for autofill (for example, a text field used in a
     *       "Captcha" challenge), it should be {@link #IMPORTANT_FOR_AUTOFILL_NO}.
     *   <li>When both the view and its children are irrelevant for autofill (for example, the root
     *       view of an activity containing a spreadhseet editor), it should be
     *       {@link #IMPORTANT_FOR_AUTOFILL_NO_EXCLUDE_DESCENDANTS}.
     *   <li>When the view content is relevant for autofill but its children aren't (for example,
     *       a credit card expiration date represented by a custom view that overrides the proper
     *       autofill methods and has 2 children representing the month and year), it should
     *       be {@link #IMPORTANT_FOR_AUTOFILL_YES_EXCLUDE_DESCENDANTS}.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> Setting the mode as {@link #IMPORTANT_FOR_AUTOFILL_NO} or
     * {@link #IMPORTANT_FOR_AUTOFILL_NO_EXCLUDE_DESCENDANTS} does not guarantee the view (and its
     * children) will be always be considered not important; for example, when the user explicitly
     * makes an autofill request, all views are considered important. See
     * {@link #isImportantForAutofill()} for more details about how the View's importance for
     * autofill is used.
