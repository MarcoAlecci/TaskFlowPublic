     * Allow "squashing" writes in {@link #maybeWriteSquashed}. This allows subsequent calls to
     * {@link #maybeWriteSquashed(Parcelable)} to "squash" the same instances into one in a Parcel.
     *
     * Typically, this method is called at the beginning of {@link Parcelable#writeToParcel}. The
     * caller must retain the return value from this method and call {@link #restoreAllowSquashing}
     * with it.
     *
     * See {@link #maybeWriteSquashed(Parcelable)} for the details.
