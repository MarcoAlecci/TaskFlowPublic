         * to be played to the all the selected routes. This is different from {@link

         * where the media is expected to 'move' from one route to another.
         * <p>
         * The given route must satisfy all of the following conditions:
         * <ul>
         * <li>It should not be included in {@link #getSelectedRoutes()}</li>
         * <li>It should be included in {@link #getSelectableRoutes()}</li>
         * </ul>
         * If the route doesn't meet any of above conditions, it will be ignored.
