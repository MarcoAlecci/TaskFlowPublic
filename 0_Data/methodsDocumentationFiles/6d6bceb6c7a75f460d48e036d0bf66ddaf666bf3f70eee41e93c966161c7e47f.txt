     * Called to get information about the children of a media item.
     * <p>
     * Implementations must call {@link Result#sendResult result.sendResult}
     * with the list of children. If loading the children will be an expensive
     * operation that should be performed on another thread,
     * {@link Result#detach result.detach} may be called before returning from
     * this function, and then {@link Result#sendResult result.sendResult}
     * called when the loading is complete.
     * </p><p>
     * In case the media item does not have any children, call {@link Result#sendResult}
     * with an empty list. When the given {@code parentId} is invalid, implementations must
     * call {@link Result#sendResult result.sendResult} with {@code null}, which will invoke
     * {@link MediaBrowser.SubscriptionCallback#onError}.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param parentId The id of the parent media item whose children are to be
     *            queried.
     * @param result The Result to send the list of children to.
     * @param options The bundle of service-specific arguments sent from the media
     *            browser. The information returned through the result should be
     *            affected by the contents of this bundle.
