     * <p>
     * Use this if your listener has a user interface that allows the user to snooze a notification
     * until a given {@link SnoozeCriterion}. It should be called after the user snoozes a single
     * notification using your UI; upon being informed, the notification manager will actually
     * remove the notification and you will get an
     * {@link #onNotificationRemoved(StatusBarNotification)} callback. When the snoozing period
     * expires, you will get a {@link #onNotificationPosted(StatusBarNotification, RankingMap)}
     * callback for the notification.
     * @param key The key of the notification to snooze
     * @param snoozeCriterionId The{@link SnoozeCriterion#getId()} of a context to snooze the
     *                          notification until.
     * @hide
