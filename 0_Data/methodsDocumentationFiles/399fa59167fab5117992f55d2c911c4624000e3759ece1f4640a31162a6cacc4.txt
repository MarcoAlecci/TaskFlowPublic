     * Returns a {@link Bundle} of extras that was meant to be sent to the calling app when it was
     * suspended. An app with the permission {@code android.permission.SUSPEND_APPS} can supply this
     * to the system at the time of suspending an app.
     *
     * <p>This is the same {@link Bundle} that is sent along with the broadcast
     * {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_SUSPENDED}, whenever the app is suspended. The contents of
     * this {@link Bundle} are a contract between the suspended app and the suspending app.
     *
     * <p>Note: These extras are optional, so if no extras were supplied to the system, this method
     * will return {@code null}, even when the calling app has been suspended.
     *
     * @return A {@link Bundle} containing the extras for the app, or {@code null} if the
     * package is not currently suspended.
