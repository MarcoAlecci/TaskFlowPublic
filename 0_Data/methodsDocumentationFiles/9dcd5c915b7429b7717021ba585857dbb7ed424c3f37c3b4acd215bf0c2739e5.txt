     * Attach the SurfaceTexture to the OpenGL ES context that is current on the calling thread.  A
     * new OpenGL ES texture object is created and populated with the SurfaceTexture image frame
     * that was current at the time of the last call to {@link #detachFromGLContext}.  This new
     * texture is bound to the {@code GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES} texture target.
     * <p>
     * This can be used to access the SurfaceTexture image contents from multiple OpenGL ES
     * contexts.  Note, however, that the image contents are only accessible from one OpenGL ES
     * context at a time.
     *
     * @param texName The name of the OpenGL ES texture that will be created.  This texture name
     * must be unusued in the OpenGL ES context that is current on the calling thread.
