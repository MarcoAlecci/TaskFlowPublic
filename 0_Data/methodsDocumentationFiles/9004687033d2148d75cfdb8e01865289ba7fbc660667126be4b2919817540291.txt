     * Called from the framework when the {@link RcsImsCapabilities} that have been configured for
     * this {@link RcsFeature} has changed.
     * <p>
     * For each newly enabled capability flag, the corresponding capability should be brought up in
     * the {@link RcsFeature} and registered on the network. For each newly disabled capability
     * flag, the corresponding capability should be brought down, and deregistered. Once a new
     * capability has been initialized and is ready for usage, the status of that capability should
     * also be set to true using {@link #notifyCapabilitiesStatusChanged(RcsImsCapabilities)}. This
     * will notify the framework that the capability is ready.
     * <p>
     * If for some reason one or more of these capabilities can not be enabled/disabled,
     * {@link CapabilityCallbackProxy#onChangeCapabilityConfigurationError(int, int, int)} should
     * be called for each capability change that resulted in an error.
