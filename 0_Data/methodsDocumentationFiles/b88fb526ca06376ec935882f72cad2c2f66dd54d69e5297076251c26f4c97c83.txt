     * Adds a whitelisted restricted permission for an app.
     *
     * <p> Permissions can be hard restricted which means that the app cannot hold
     * them or soft restricted where the app can hold the permission but in a weaker
     * form. Whether a permission is {@link PermissionInfo#FLAG_HARD_RESTRICTED hard
     * restricted} or {@link PermissionInfo#FLAG_SOFT_RESTRICTED soft restricted}
     * depends on the permission declaration. Whitelisting a hard restricted permission
     * allows for the to hold that permission and whitelisting a soft restricted
     * permission allows the app to hold the permission in its full, unrestricted form.
     *
     * <p><ol>There are three whitelists:
     *
     * <li>one for cases where the system permission policy whitelists a permission
     * This list corresponds to the {@link #FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_SYSTEM} flag.
     * Can only be modified by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission.
     *
     * <li>one for cases where the system whitelists the permission when upgrading
     * from an OS version in which the permission was not restricted to an OS version
     * in which the permission is restricted. This list corresponds to the {@link
     * #FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_UPGRADE} flag. Can be modified by pre-installed
     * holders of a dedicated permission. The installer on record can only remove
     * permissions from this whitelist.
     *
     * <li>one for cases where the installer of the package whitelists a permission.
     * This list corresponds to the {@link #FLAG_PERMISSION_WHITELIST_INSTALLER} flag.
     * Can be modified by pre-installed holders of a dedicated permission or the installer
     * on record.
     *
     * <p>You need to specify the whitelists for which to set the whitelisted permissions
     * which will clear the previous whitelisted permissions and replace them with the
     * provided ones.
     *
     * @param packageName The app for which to get whitelisted permissions.
     * @param permName The whitelisted permission to add.
     * @param whitelistFlags The whitelists to which to add. Passing multiple flags
     * updates all specified whitelists.
     * @return Whether the permission was added to the whitelist.
