     * Called by ConnectivityService to add specific packet filter to network hardware to block
     * replies (e.g., TCP ACKs) matching the sent keepalive packets. Implementations that support
     * this feature must override this method.
     *
     * @param slot the hardware slot on which the keepalive should be sent.
     * @param packet the packet that is being sent.
