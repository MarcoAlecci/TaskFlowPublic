         * <p>Note that this feature requires that the secure lock screen (e.g., password, PIN,
         * pattern) is set up, otherwise key pair generation will fail. Moreover, this key pair will
         * be deleted when the secure lock screen is disabled or reset (e.g., by the user or a
         * Device Administrator). Finally, this key pair cannot be used until the user unlocks the
         * secure lock screen after boot.
