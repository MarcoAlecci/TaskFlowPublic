     * Explicitly sets the conditions for which content capture should be available by an app.
     *
     * <p>Typically used to restrict content capture to a few websites on browser apps. Example:
     *
     * <code>
     *   ArraySet<ContentCaptureCondition> conditions = new ArraySet<>(1);
     *   conditions.add(new ContentCaptureCondition(new LocusId("^https://.*\\.example\\.com$"),
     *       ContentCaptureCondition.FLAG_IS_REGEX));
     *   service.setContentCaptureConditions("com.example.browser_app", conditions);
     *
     * </code>
     *
     * <p>NOTE: </p> this method doesn't automatically disable content capture for the given
     * conditions; it's up to the {@code packageName} implementation to call
     * {@link ContentCaptureManager#getContentCaptureConditions()} and disable it accordingly.
     *
     * @param packageName name of the packages where the restrictions are set.
     * @param conditions list of conditions, or {@code null} to reset the conditions for the
     * package.
