     * Sets the current tab and focuses the UI on it.
     * This method makes sure that the focused tab matches the selected
     * tab, normally at {@link #setCurrentTab}.  Normally this would not
     * be an issue if we go through the UI, since the UI is responsible
     * for calling TabWidget.onFocusChanged(), but in the case where we
     * are selecting the tab programmatically, we'll need to make sure
     * focus keeps up.
     *
     *  @param index The tab that you want focused (highlighted in orange)
     *  and selected (tab brought to the front of the widget)
     *
     *  @see #setCurrentTab
