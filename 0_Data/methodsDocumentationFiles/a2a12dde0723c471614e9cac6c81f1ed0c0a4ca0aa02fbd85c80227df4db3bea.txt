     * Rethrow this exception when we know it came from the system server. This
     * gives us an opportunity to throw a nice clean
     * {@link DeadSystemException} signal to avoid spamming logs with
     * misleading stack traces.
     * <p>
     * Apps making calls into the system server may end up persisting internal
     * state or making security decisions based on the perceived success or
     * failure of a call, or any default values returned. For this reason, we
     * want to strongly throw when there was trouble with the transaction.
