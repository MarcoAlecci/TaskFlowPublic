         * Called when a descendant view of the RecyclerView requests focus.
         *
         * <p>A LayoutManager wishing to keep focused views aligned in a specific
         * portion of the view may implement that behavior in an override of this method.</p>
         *
         * <p>If the LayoutManager executes different behavior that should override the default
         * behavior of scrolling the focused child on screen instead of running alongside it,
         * this method should return true.</p>
         *
         * @param parent  The RecyclerView hosting this LayoutManager
         * @param state   Current state of RecyclerView
         * @param child   Direct child of the RecyclerView containing the newly focused view
         * @param focused The newly focused view. This may be the same view as child or it may be
         *                null
         * @return true if the default scroll behavior should be suppressed
