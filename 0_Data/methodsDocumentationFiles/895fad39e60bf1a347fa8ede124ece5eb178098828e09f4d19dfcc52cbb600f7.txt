     * Get an array of KeyEvent objects that if put into the input stream
     * could plausibly generate the provided sequence of characters.  It is
     * not guaranteed that the sequence is the only way to generate these
     * events or that it is optimal.
     * <p>
     * This function is primarily offered for instrumentation and testing purposes.
     * It may fail to map characters to key codes.  In particular, the key character
     * map for the {@link #BUILT_IN_KEYBOARD built-in keyboard} device id may be empty.
     * Consider using the key character map associated with the
     * {@link #VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD virtual keyboard} device id instead.
     * </p><p>
     * For robust text entry, do not use this function.  Instead construct a
     * {@link KeyEvent} with action code {@link KeyEvent#ACTION_MULTIPLE} that contains
     * the desired string using {@link KeyEvent#KeyEvent(long, String, int, int)}.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param chars The sequence of characters to generate.
     * @return An array of {@link KeyEvent} objects, or null if the given char array
     *         can not be generated using the current key character map.
     * @throws {@link IllegalArgumentException} if the passed array of characters is null.
