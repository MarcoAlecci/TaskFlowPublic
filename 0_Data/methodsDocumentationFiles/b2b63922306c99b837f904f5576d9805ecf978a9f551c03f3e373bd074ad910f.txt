     * Let StorageManager know that the quota type for a file on external storage should
     * be updated. Android tracks quotas for various media types. Consequently, this should be
     * called on first creation of a new file on external storage, and whenever the
     * media type of the file is updated later.
     *
     * This API doesn't require any special permissions, though typical implementations
     * will require being called from an SELinux domain that allows setting file attributes
     * related to quota (eg the GID or project ID).
     *
     * The default platform user of this API is the MediaProvider process, which is
     * responsible for managing all of external storage.
     *
     * @param path the path to the file for which we should update the quota type
     * @param quotaType the quota type of the file; this is based on the
     *                  {@code QuotaType} constants, eg
     *                  {@code StorageManager.QUOTA_TYPE_MEDIA_AUDIO}
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code quotaType} does not correspond to a valid
     *                                  quota type.
     * @throws IOException              if the quota type could not be updated.
