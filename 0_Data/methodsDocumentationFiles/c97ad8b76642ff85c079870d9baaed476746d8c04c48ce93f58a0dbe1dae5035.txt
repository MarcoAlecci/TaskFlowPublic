     * Return a resource identifier for the given resource name.  A fully
     * qualified resource name is of the form "package:type/entry".  The first
     * two components (package and type) are optional if defType and
     * defPackage, respectively, are specified here.
     * 
     * <p>Note: use of this function is discouraged.  It is much more
     * efficient to retrieve resources by identifier than by name.
     * 
     * @param name The name of the desired resource.
     * @param defType Optional default resource type to find, if "type/" is
     *                not included in the name.  Can be null to require an
     *                explicit type.
     * @param defPackage Optional default package to find, if "package:" is
     *                   not included in the name.  Can be null to require an
     *                   explicit package.
     * 
     * @return int The associated resource identifier.  Returns 0 if no such
     *         resource was found.  (0 is not a valid resource ID.)
