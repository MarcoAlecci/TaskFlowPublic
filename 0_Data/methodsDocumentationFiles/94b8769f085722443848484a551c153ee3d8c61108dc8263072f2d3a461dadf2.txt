     * Add a service attribute as a key/value pair.
     *
     * <p> Service attributes are included as DNS-SD TXT record pairs.
     *
     * <p> The key must be US-ASCII printable characters, excluding the '=' character.  Values may
     * be UTF-8 strings or null.  The total length of key + value must be less than 255 bytes.
     *
     * <p> Keys should be short, ideally no more than 9 characters, and unique per instance of
     * {@link NsdServiceInfo}.  Calling {@link #setAttribute} twice with the same key will overwrite
     * first value.
