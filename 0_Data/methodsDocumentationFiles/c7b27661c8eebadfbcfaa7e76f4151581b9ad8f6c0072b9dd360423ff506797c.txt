     * Create a new document and return its newly generated
     * {@link Document#COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID}. You must allocate a new
     * {@link Document#COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID} to represent the document, which must
     * not change once returned.
     *
     * @param parentDocumentId the parent directory to create the new document
     *            under.
     * @param mimeType the concrete MIME type associated with the new document.
     *            If the MIME type is not supported, the provider must throw.
     * @param displayName the display name of the new document. The provider may
     *            alter this name to meet any internal constraints, such as
     *            avoiding conflicting names.

     * @throws AuthenticationRequiredException If authentication is required from the user (such as
     *             login credentials), but it is not guaranteed that the client will handle this
     *             properly.
