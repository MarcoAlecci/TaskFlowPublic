         * Configure the selection and selection arguments to use for this
         * operation. This method will replace any previously defined selection
         * and selection arguments, but it will not replace any back-reference
         * requests.
         * <p>
         * An occurrence of {@code ?} in the selection will be replaced with the
         * corresponding selection argument when the operation is executed.
         * <p>
         * Any selection argument may be dynamically overwritten using the
         * result of a previous operation by using methods such as
         * {@link #withSelectionBackReference(int, int)}.
