     * This value is defined only for continuous and on-change sensors. It is the delay between two
     * sensor events corresponding to the lowest frequency that this sensor supports. When lower
     * frequencies are requested through registerListener() the events will be generated at this
     * frequency instead. It can be used to estimate when the batch FIFO may be full. Older devices
     * may set this value to zero. Ignore this value in case it is negative or zero.
     *
     * @return The max delay for this sensor in microseconds.
