     * Notify the system of new network statistics.
     *
     * Send the network statistics recorded since the last call to {@link #notifyStatsUpdated}. Must
     * be called as soon as possible after {@link NetworkStatsProvider#onRequestStatsUpdate(int)}
     * being called. Responding later increases the probability stats will be dropped. The
     * provider can also call this whenever it wants to reports new stats for any reason.
     * Note that the system will not necessarily immediately propagate the statistics to
     * reflect the update.
     *
     * @param token the token under which these stats were gathered. Providers can call this method
     *              with the current token as often as they want, until the token changes.
     *              {@see NetworkStatsProvider#onRequestStatsUpdate()}
     * @param ifaceStats the {@link NetworkStats} per interface to be reported.
     *                   The provider should not include any traffic that is already counted by
     *                   kernel interface counters.
     * @param uidStats the same stats as above, but counts {@link NetworkStats}
     *                 per uid.
