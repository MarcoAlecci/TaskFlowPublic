     * Pins distance to 0 <= distance <= getLength(), and then computes the
     * corresponding position and tangent. Returns false if there is no path,
     * or a zero-length path was specified, in which case position and tangent
     * are unchanged.
     *
     * @param distance The distance along the current contour to sample
     * @param pos If not null, returns the sampled position (x==[0], y==[1])
     * @param tan If not null, returns the sampled tangent (x==[0], y==[1])
     * @return false if there was no path associated with this measure object
