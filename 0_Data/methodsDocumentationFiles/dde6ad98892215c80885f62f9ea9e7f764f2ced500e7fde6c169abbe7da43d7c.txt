     * Set a hint for the renderer responsible for drawing this bitmap
     * indicating that it should attempt to use mipmaps when this bitmap
     * is drawn scaled down.
     *
     * If you know that you are going to draw this bitmap at less than
     * 50% of its original size, you may be able to obtain a higher
     * quality by turning this property on.
     *
     * Note that if the renderer respects this hint it might have to
     * allocate extra memory to hold the mipmap levels for this bitmap.
     *
     * This property is only a suggestion that can be ignored by the
     * renderer. It is not guaranteed to have any effect.
     *
     * @param hasMipMap indicates whether the renderer should attempt
     *                  to use mipmaps
