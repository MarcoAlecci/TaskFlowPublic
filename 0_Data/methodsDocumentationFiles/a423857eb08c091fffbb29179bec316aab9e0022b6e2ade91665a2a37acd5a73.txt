     * Inflate a new view hierarchy from the specified xml node. Throws
     * {@link InflateException} if there is an error. *
     * <p>
     * <em><strong>Important</strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For performance
     * reasons, view inflation relies heavily on pre-processing of XML files
     * that is done at build time. Therefore, it is not currently possible to
     * use LayoutInflater with an XmlPullParser over a plain XML file at runtime.

     * @param parser XML dom node containing the description of the view
     *        hierarchy.
     * @param root Optional view to be the parent of the generated hierarchy.
     * @return The root View of the inflated hierarchy. If root was supplied,
     *         this is the root View; otherwise it is the root of the inflated
     *         XML file.
