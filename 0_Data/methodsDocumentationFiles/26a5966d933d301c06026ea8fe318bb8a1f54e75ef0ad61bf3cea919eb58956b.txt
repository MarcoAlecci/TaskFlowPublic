     * Create a new InputConnection for an InputMethod to interact
     * with the view.  The default implementation returns null, since it doesn't
     * support input methods.  You can override this to implement such support.
     * This is only needed for views that take focus and text input.
     *
     * <p>When implementing this, you probably also want to implement
     * {@link #onCheckIsTextEditor()} to indicate you will return a
     * non-null InputConnection.</p>
     *
     * <p>Also, take good care to fill in the {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo}
     * object correctly and in its entirety, so that the connected IME can rely
     * on its values. For example, {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#initialSelStart}
     * and  {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#initialSelEnd} members
     * must be filled in with the correct cursor position for IMEs to work correctly
     * with your application.</p>
     *
     * @param outAttrs Fill in with attribute information about the connection.
