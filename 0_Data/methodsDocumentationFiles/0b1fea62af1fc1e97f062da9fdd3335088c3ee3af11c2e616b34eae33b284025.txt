     * Convenience function for creating a {@link #ACTION_CHOOSER} Intent.
     *
     * <p>Builds a new {@link #ACTION_CHOOSER} Intent that wraps the given
     * target intent, also optionally supplying a title.  If the target
     * intent has specified {@link #FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION} or
     * {@link #FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION}, then these flags will also be
     * set in the returned chooser intent, with its ClipData set appropriately:
     * either a direct reflection of {@link #getClipData()} if that is non-null,
     * or a new ClipData built from {@link #getData()}.
     *
     * @param target The Intent that the user will be selecting an activity
     * to perform.
     * @param title Optional title that will be displayed in the chooser,
     * only when the target action is not ACTION_SEND or ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE.
     * @return Return a new Intent object that you can hand to
     * {@link Context#startActivity(Intent) Context.startActivity()} and
     * related methods.
