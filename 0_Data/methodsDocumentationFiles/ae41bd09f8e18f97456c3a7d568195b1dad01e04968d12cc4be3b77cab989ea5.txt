     * Determine whether the calling process and user ID has been
     * granted permission to access a specific URI.  This is basically
     * the same as calling {@link #checkUriPermission(Uri, int, int,
     * int)} with the pid and uid returned by {@link
     * android.os.Binder#getCallingPid} and {@link
     * android.os.Binder#getCallingUid}.  One important difference is
     * that if you are not currently processing an IPC, this function
     * will always fail.
     *
     * @param uri The uri that is being checked.
     * @param modeFlags The access modes to check.
     *
     * @return {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_GRANTED} if the caller
     * is allowed to access that uri, or
     * {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_DENIED} if it is not.
     *
     * @see #checkUriPermission(Uri, int, int, int)
