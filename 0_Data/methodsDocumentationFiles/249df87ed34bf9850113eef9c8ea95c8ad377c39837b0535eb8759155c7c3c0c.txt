     * Change all of the result data returned from this broadcasts; only works
     * with broadcasts sent through
     * {@link Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)
     * Context.sendOrderedBroadcast}.  All current result data is replaced
     * by the value given to this method.
     *
     * <p><strong>This method does not work with non-ordered broadcasts such
     * as those sent with {@link Context#sendBroadcast(Intent)
     * Context.sendBroadcast}</strong></p>
     *
     * @param code The new result code.  Often uses the
     * Activity {@link android.app.Activity#RESULT_CANCELED} and
     * {@link android.app.Activity#RESULT_OK} constants, though the
     * actual meaning of this value is ultimately up to the broadcaster.
     * @param data The new result data.  This is an arbitrary
     * string whose interpretation is up to the broadcaster; may be null.
     * @param extras The new extra data map.  This is a Bundle
     * holding arbitrary data, whose interpretation is up to the
     * broadcaster.  Can be set to null.  This completely
     * replaces the current map (if any).
