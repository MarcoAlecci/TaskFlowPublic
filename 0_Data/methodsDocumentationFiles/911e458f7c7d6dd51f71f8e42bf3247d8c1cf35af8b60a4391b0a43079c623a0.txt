     * @return a relative time string to display the time expressed by millis.  Times
     * are counted starting at midnight, which means that assuming that the current
     * time is March 31st, 0:30:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>"millis=0:10 today" will be displayed as "0:10"</li>
     *   <li>"millis=11:30pm the day before" will be displayed as "Mar 30"</li>
     * </ul>
     * If the given millis is in a different year, then the full date is
     * returned in numeric format (e.g., "10/12/2008").
     *
     * @param withPreposition If true, the string returned will include the correct
     * preposition ("at 9:20am", "on 10/12/2008" or "on May 29").
