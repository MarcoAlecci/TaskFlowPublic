     * Ask the transport where, on local device storage, to keep backup state blobs.
     * This is per-transport so that mock transports used for testing can coexist with
     * "live" backup services without interfering with the live bookkeeping.  The
     * returned string should be a name that is expected to be unambiguous among all
     * available backup transports; the name of the class implementing the transport
     * is a good choice.
     *
     * @return A unique name, suitable for use as a file or directory name, that the
     *         Backup Manager could use to disambiguate state files associated with
     *         different backup transports.
