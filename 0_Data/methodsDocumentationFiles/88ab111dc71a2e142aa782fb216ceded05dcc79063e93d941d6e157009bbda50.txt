     * Manually invoke Android Beam to share data.
     *
     * <p>The Android Beam animation is normally only shown when two NFC-capable
     * devices come into range.
     * By calling this method, an Activity can invoke the Beam animation directly
     * even if no other NFC device is in range yet. The Beam animation will then
     * prompt the user to tap another NFC-capable device to complete the data
     * transfer.
     *
     * <p>The main advantage of using this method is that it avoids the need for the
     * user to tap the screen to complete the transfer, as this method already
     * establishes the direction of the transfer and the consent of the user to
     * share data. Callers are responsible for making sure that the user has
     * consented to sharing data on NFC tap.
     *
     * <p>Note that to use this method, the passed in Activity must have already
     * set data to share over Beam by using method calls such as
     * {@link #setNdefPushMessageCallback} or
     * {@link #setBeamPushUrisCallback}.
     *
     * @param activity the current foreground Activity that has registered data to share
     * @return whether the Beam animation was successfully invoked
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if FEATURE_NFC is unavailable.
     * @deprecated this feature is deprecated. File sharing can work using other technology like
     * Bluetooth.
