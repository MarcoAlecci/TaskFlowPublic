     * (Optional) Publisher for suggested controls
     *
     * The service may be asked to provide a small number of recommended controls, in
     * order to suggest some controls to the user for favoriting. The controls shall be built using
     * the stateless builder {@link Control.StatelessBuilder}. The total number of controls
     * requested through {@link Subscription#request} will be restricted to a maximum. Within this
     * larger limit, only 6 controls per structure will be loaded. Therefore, it is advisable to
     * seed multiple structures if they exist. Any control sent over this limit  will be discarded.
     * Call {@link Subscriber#onComplete} when done, or {@link Subscriber#onError} for error
     * scenarios.
