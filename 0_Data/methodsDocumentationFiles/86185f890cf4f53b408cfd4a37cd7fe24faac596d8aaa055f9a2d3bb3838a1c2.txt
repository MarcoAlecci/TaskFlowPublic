     * Gets the clock's Drift in nanoseconds per second.
     *
     * <p>This value is the instantaneous time-derivative of the value provided by
     * {@link #getBiasNanos()}.
     *
     * <p>A positive value indicates that the frequency is higher than the nominal (e.g. GPS master
     * clock) frequency. The error estimate for this reported drift is
     * {@link #getDriftUncertaintyNanosPerSecond()}.
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasDriftNanosPerSecond()} is {@code true}.
