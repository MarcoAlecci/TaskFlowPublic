         * Convenience method to add a network route to the VPN interface
         * using a numeric address string. See {@link InetAddress} for the
         * definitions of numeric address formats.
         *
         * Adding a route implicitly allows traffic from that address family
         * (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6) to be routed over the VPN. @see #allowFamily
         *
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the route is invalid.
         * @see #addRoute(InetAddress, int)
