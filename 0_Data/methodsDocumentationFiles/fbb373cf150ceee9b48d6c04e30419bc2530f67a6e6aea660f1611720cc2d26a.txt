     * Reads a character from this file. This method reads two
     * bytes from the file, starting at the current file pointer.
     * If the bytes read, in order, are
     * {@code b1} and {@code b2}, where
     * <code>0&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;b1,&nbsp;b2&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;255</code>,
     * then the result is equal to:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *     (char)((b1 &lt;&lt; 8) | b2)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until the two bytes are read, the end of the
     * stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @return     the next two bytes of this file, interpreted as a
     *                  {@code char}.
     * @exception  EOFException  if this file reaches the end before reading
     *               two bytes.
     * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
