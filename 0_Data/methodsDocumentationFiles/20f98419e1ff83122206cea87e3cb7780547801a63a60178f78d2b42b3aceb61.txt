     * Returns an estimate of the total number of tasks stolen from
     * one thread's work queue by another. The reported value
     * underestimates the actual total number of steals when the pool
     * is not quiescent. This value may be useful for monitoring and
     * tuning fork/join programs: in general, steal counts should be
     * high enough to keep threads busy, but low enough to avoid
     * overhead and contention across threads.
     *
     * @return the number of steals
