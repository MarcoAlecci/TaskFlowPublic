         * Performs a query to return all visible instances in the given range
         * that match the given query. This is a blocking function and should
         * not be done on the UI thread. This will cause an expansion of
         * recurring events to fill this time range if they are not already
         * expanded and will slow down for larger time ranges with many
         * recurring events.
         *
         * @param cr The ContentResolver to use for the query
         * @param projection The columns to return
         * @param begin The start of the time range to query in UTC millis since
         *            epoch
         * @param end The end of the time range to query in UTC millis since
         *            epoch
         * @param searchQuery A string of space separated search terms. Segments
         *            enclosed by double quotes will be treated as a single
         *            term.
         * @return A Cursor of instances matching the search terms in the given
         *         time range
