     * Display the dialog, adding the fragment to the given FragmentManager.  This
     * is a convenience for explicitly creating a transaction, adding the
     * fragment to it with the given tag, and committing it.  This does
     * <em>not</em> add the transaction to the back stack.  When the fragment
     * is dismissed, a new transaction will be executed to remove it from
     * the activity.
     * @param manager The FragmentManager this fragment will be added to.
     * @param tag The tag for this fragment, as per
     * {@link FragmentTransaction#add(Fragment, String) FragmentTransaction.add}.
