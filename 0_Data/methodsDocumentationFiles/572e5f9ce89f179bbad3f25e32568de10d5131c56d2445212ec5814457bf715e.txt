     * Returns the mapping of attribute resource ID to source resource ID where the attribute value
     * was set. Source resource ID can either be a layout resource ID, if the value was set in XML
     * within the View tag, or a style resource ID, if the attribute was set in a style. The source
     * resource value will be one of the resource IDs from {@link #getAttributeSourceResourceMap()}.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> this method will only return actual values if the view attribute debugging
     * is enabled in Android developer options.
