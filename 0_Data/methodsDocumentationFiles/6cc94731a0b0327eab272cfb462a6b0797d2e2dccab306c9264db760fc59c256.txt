         * Called when a network disconnects or otherwise no longer satisfies this request or
         * callback.
         *
         * <p>If the callback was registered with requestNetwork() or
         * registerDefaultNetworkCallback(), it will only be invoked against the last network
         * returned by onAvailable() when that network is lost and no other network satisfies
         * the criteria of the request.
         *
         * <p>If the callback was registered with registerNetworkCallback() it will be called for
         * each network which no longer satisfies the criteria of the callback.
         *
         * <p>Do NOT call {@link #getNetworkCapabilities(Network)} or
         * {@link #getLinkProperties(Network)} or other synchronous ConnectivityManager methods in
         * this callback as this is prone to race conditions ; calling these methods while in a
         * callback may return an outdated or even a null object.
         *
         * @param network The {@link Network} lost.
