     * Return this NDEF Record as a byte array.<p>
     * This method is deprecated, use {@link NdefMessage#toByteArray}
     * instead. This is because the NDEF binary format is not defined for
     * a record outside of the context of a message: the MB and ME flags
     * cannot be set without knowing the location inside a message.<p>
     * This implementation will attempt to serialize a single record by
     * always setting the MB and ME flags (in other words, assume this
     * is a single-record NDEF Message).<p>
     *
     * @deprecated use {@link NdefMessage#toByteArray()} instead
