     * Test the equality of two HTTP cookies.
     *
     * <p> The result is {@code true} only if two cookies come from same domain
     * (case-insensitive), have same name (case-insensitive), and have same path
     * (case-sensitive).
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if two HTTP cookies equal to each other;
     *          otherwise, {@code false}
