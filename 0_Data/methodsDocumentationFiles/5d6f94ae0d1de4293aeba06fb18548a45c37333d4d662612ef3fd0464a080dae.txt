     * Create a new NDEF Record containing external (application-specific) data.<p>
     * Use this method to encode application specific data into an NDEF Record.
     * The data is typed by a domain name (usually your Android package name) and
     * a domain-specific type. This data is packaged into a "NFC Forum External
     * Type" NDEF Record.<p>
     * NFC Forum requires that the domain and type used in an external record
     * are treated as case insensitive, however Android intent filtering is
     * always case sensitive. So this method will force the domain and type to
     * lower-case before creating the NDEF Record.<p>
     * The unchecked exception {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown
     * if the domain and type have serious problems, for example if either field
     * is empty, so always catch this
     * exception if you are passing user-generated data into this method.<p>
     * There are no such restrictions on the payload data.<p>
     * For efficiency, This method might not make an internal copy of the
     * data byte array, so take care not
     * to modify the data byte array while still using the returned
     * NdefRecord.
