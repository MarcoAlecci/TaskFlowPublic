     * Gets the clock's sub-nanosecond bias.
     *
     * <p>See the description of how this field is part of converting from hardware clock time, to
     * GPS time, in {@link #getFullBiasNanos()}.
     *
     * <p>The error estimate for the sum of this field and {@link #getFullBiasNanos} is
     * {@link #getBiasUncertaintyNanos()}.
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasBiasNanos()} is {@code true}.
