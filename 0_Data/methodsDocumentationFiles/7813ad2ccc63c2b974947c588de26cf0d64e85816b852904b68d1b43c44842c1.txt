     * Returns a transport-specific information container. The application may cast this
     * container to a concrete sub-class based on its knowledge of the network request. The
     * application should be able to deal with a {@code null} return value or an invalid case,
     * e.g. use {@code instanceof} operator to verify expected type.
     *
     * @return A concrete implementation of the {@link TransportInfo} class or null if not
     * available for the network.
