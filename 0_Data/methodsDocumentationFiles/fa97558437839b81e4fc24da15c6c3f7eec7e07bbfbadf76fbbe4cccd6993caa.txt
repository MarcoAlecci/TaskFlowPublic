     * Plays the AnimatorSet in reverse. If the animation has been seeked to a specific play time
     * using {@link #setCurrentPlayTime(long)}, it will play backwards from the point seeked when
     * reverse was called. Otherwise, then it will start from the end and play backwards. This
     * behavior is only set for the current animation; future playing of the animation will use the
     * default behavior of playing forward.
     * <p>
     * Note: reverse is not supported for infinite AnimatorSet.
