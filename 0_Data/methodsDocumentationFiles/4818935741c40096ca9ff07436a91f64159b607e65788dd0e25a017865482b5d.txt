     * Called when an app requests a slice it does not have write permission
     * to the uri for.
     * <p>
     * The return value will be the action on a slice that prompts the user that
     * the calling app wants to show slices from this app. The default implementation
     * launches a dialog that allows the user to grant access to this slice. Apps
     * that do not want to allow this user grant, can override this and instead
     * launch their own dialog with different behavior.
     *
     * @param sliceUri the Uri of the slice attempting to be bound.
     * @see #getCallingPackage()
