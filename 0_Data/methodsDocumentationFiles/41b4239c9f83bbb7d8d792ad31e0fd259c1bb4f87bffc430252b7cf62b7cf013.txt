     * Checks if <a href="AutofillService.html#FieldClassification">field classification</a> is
     * enabled.
     *
     * <p>As field classification is an expensive operation, it could be disabled, either
     * temporarily (for example, because the service exceeded a rate-limit threshold) or
     * permanently (for example, because the device is a low-level device).
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> This method should only be called by an app providing an autofill service,
     * and it's ignored if the caller currently doesn't have an enabled autofill service for
     * the user.
