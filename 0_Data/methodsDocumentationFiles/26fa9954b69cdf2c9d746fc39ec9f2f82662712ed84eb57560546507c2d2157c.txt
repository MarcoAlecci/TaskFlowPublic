     * <p>Releases all the resources and effects associated with the EffectContext. This renders the
     * context and all the effects bound to this context invalid. You must no longer use the context
     * or any of its bound effects after calling release().</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that this method must be called with the proper EGL context made current, as the
     * EffectContext and its effects may release internal GL resources.</p>
