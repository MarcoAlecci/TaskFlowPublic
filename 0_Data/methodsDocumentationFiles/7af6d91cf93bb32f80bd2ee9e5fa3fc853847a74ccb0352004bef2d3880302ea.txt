     * Returns a string representation of this {@code BigDecimal}. This
     * representation always prints all significant digits of this value.
     * <p>
     * If the scale is negative or if {@code scale - precision >= 6} then
     * engineering notation is used. Engineering notation is similar to the
     * scientific notation except that the exponent is made to be a multiple of
     * 3 such that the integer part is >= 1 and < 1000.

     * @return a string representation of {@code this} in engineering notation
     *         if necessary.
