     * Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.
     * <p>
     * The comparison is based first on the instant, then on the local date-time,
     * then on the zone ID, then on the chronology.
     * It is "consistent with equals", as defined by {@link Comparable}.
     * <p>
     * If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
     * additional chronology stage is not required.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.
     *
     * @param other  the other date-time to compare to, not null
     * @return the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater
