     *
     * <p>Releases the effect and any resources associated with it. You may call this if you need to
     * make sure acquired resources are no longer held by the effect. Releasing an effect makes it
     * invalid for reuse.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that this method must be called with the EffectContext and EGL context current, as
     * the effect may release internal GL resources.</p>
