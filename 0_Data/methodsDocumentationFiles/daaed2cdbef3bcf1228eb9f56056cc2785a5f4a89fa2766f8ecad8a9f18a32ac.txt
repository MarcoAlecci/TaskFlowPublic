     *  <p>This takes an input that functions like
     *  {@link BitmapFactory.Options#inSampleSize}. It returns a width and
     *  height that can be acheived by sampling the encoded image. Other widths
     *  and heights may be supported, but will require an additional (internal)
     *  scaling step. Such internal scaling is *not* supported with
     *  {@link #setRequireUnpremultiplied} set to {@code true}.</p>
     *
     *  @param sampleSize Sampling rate of the encoded image.
     *  @return {@link android.util.Size} of the width and height after
     *      sampling.
