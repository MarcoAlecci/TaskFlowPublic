     * Gets or creates a RenderScript context of the specified type.
     *
     * The returned context will be cached for future reuse within

     * RenderScript it should call releaseAllContexts()
     *
     * A process context is a context designed for easy creation and
     * lifecycle management.  Multiple calls to this function will
     * return the same object provided they are called with the same
     * options.  This allows it to be used any time a RenderScript
     * context is needed.
     *
     * Prior to API 23 this always created a new context.
     *
     * @param ctx The context.
     * @param ct The type of context to be created.
     * @param flags The OR of the CREATE_FLAG_* options desired
     * @return RenderScript
