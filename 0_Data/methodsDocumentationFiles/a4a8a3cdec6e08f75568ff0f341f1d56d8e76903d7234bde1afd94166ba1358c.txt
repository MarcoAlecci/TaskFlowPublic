         * sets topmost frequency number (in Hz) this band will process. The
         * effective bandwidth for the band is then computed using this and the previous band
         * topmost frequency (or 0 Hz for band number 0). Frequencies are expected to increase with
         * band number, thus band 0 cutoffFrequency <= band 1 cutoffFrequency, and so on.
         * @param frequency
