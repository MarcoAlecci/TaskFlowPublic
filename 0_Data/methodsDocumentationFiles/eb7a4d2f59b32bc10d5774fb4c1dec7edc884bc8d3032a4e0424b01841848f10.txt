     * For applications that use multiple virtual screens showing a wallpaper,
     * specify the step size between virtual screens. For example, if the
     * launcher has 3 virtual screens, it would specify an xStep of 0.5,
     * since the X offset for those screens are 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0
     * @param xStep The X offset delta from one screen to the next one
     * @param yStep The Y offset delta from one screen to the next one
