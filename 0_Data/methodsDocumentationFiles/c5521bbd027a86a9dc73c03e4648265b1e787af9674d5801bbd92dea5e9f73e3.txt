     * Adds an {@link OnAccountsUpdateListener} to this instance of the {@link AccountManager}. This
     * listener will be notified whenever user or AbstractAcccountAuthenticator made changes to
     * accounts of given types related to the caller -
     * either list of accounts returned by {@link #getAccounts()}
     * was changed, or new account was added for which user can grant access to the caller.
     * <p>
     * As long as this listener is present, the AccountManager instance will not be
     * garbage-collected, and neither will the {@link Context} used to retrieve it, which may be a
     * large Activity instance. To avoid memory leaks, you must remove this listener before then.
     * Normally listeners are added in an Activity or Service's {@link Activity#onCreate} and
     * removed in {@link Activity#onDestroy}.
     * <p>
     * It is safe to call this method from the main thread.
     *
     * @param listener The listener to send notifications to
     * @param handler {@link Handler} identifying the thread to use for notifications, null for the
     *        main thread
     * @param updateImmediately If true, the listener will be invoked (on the handler thread) right
     *        away with the current account list
     * @param accountTypes If set, only changes to accounts of given types will be reported.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if listener is null
     * @throws IllegalStateException if listener was already added
