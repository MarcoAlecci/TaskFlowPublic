     * Gets the clock's Bias Uncertainty (1-Sigma) in nanoseconds.
     *
     * <p>See the description of how this field provides the error estimate in the conversion from
     * hardware clock time, to GPS time, in {@link #getFullBiasNanos()}.
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasBiasUncertaintyNanos()} is {@code true}.
