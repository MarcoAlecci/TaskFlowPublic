     * If {@link #NOTIFY_SYNC_TO_NETWORK} is set, this will attempt to schedule
     * a local sync using the sync adapter that's registered for the authority
     * of the provided uri. No account will be passed to the sync adapter, so
     * all matching accounts will be synchronized.
     * <p>
     * Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O}, all content
     * notifications must be backed by a valid {@link ContentProvider}.

     * @param uri The uri of the content that was changed.
     * @param observer The observer that originated the change, may be
     *            <code>null</null>. The observer that originated the change
     *            will only receive the notification if it has requested to
     *            receive self-change notifications by implementing
     *            {@link ContentObserver#deliverSelfNotifications()} to return
     *            true.
     * @param flags Additional flags: {@link #NOTIFY_SYNC_TO_NETWORK}.
