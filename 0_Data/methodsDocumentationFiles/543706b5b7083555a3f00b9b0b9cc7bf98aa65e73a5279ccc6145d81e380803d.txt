     * Returns an {@link OnTouchListener} that can be added to the source view
     * to implement drag-to-open behavior. Generally, the source view should be
     * the same view that was passed to {@link #setAnchorView}.
     * <p>
     * When the listener is set on a view, touching that view and dragging
     * outside of its bounds will open the popup window. Lifting will select the
     * currently touched list item.
     * <p>
     * Example usage:
     * <pre>
     * ListPopupWindow myPopup = new ListPopupWindow(context);
     * myPopup.setAnchor(myAnchor);
     * OnTouchListener dragListener = myPopup.createDragToOpenListener(myAnchor);
     * myAnchor.setOnTouchListener(dragListener);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param src the view on which the resulting listener will be set
     * @return a touch listener that controls drag-to-open behavior
