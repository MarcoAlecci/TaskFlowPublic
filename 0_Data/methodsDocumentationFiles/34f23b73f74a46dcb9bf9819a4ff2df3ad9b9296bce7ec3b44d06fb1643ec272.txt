     * Returns a Region representing the part of the Drawable that is completely
     * transparent.  This can be used to perform drawing operations, identifying
     * which parts of the target will not change when rendering the Drawable.
     * The default implementation returns null, indicating no transparent
     * region; subclasses can optionally override this to return an actual
     * Region if they want to supply this optimization information, but it is
     * not required that they do so.
     *
     * @return Returns null if the Drawables has no transparent region to
     * report, else a Region holding the parts of the Drawable's bounds that
     * are transparent.
