     * Sets the data source (FileDescriptor) to use.  The FileDescriptor must be
     * seekable (N.B. a LocalSocket is not seekable). It is the caller's responsibility
     * to close the file descriptor. It is safe to do so as soon as this call returns.
     *
     * @param fd the FileDescriptor for the file you want to play
     * @param offset the offset into the file where the data to be played starts, in bytes
     * @param length the length in bytes of the data to be played
     * @throws IllegalStateException if it is called in an invalid state
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if fd is not a valid FileDescriptor
     * @throws IOException if fd can not be read
