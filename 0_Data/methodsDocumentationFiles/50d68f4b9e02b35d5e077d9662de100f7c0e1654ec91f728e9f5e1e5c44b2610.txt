     * Called by the system when the hosting activity is moved from one display to another without
     * recreation. This means that the activity is declared to handle all changes to configuration
     * that happened when it was switched to another display, so it wasn't destroyed and created
     * again.
     *
     * <p>This call will be followed by {@link #onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)} if the
     * applied configuration actually changed. It is up to app developer to choose whether to handle
     * the change in this method or in the following {@link #onConfigurationChanged(Configuration)}
     * call.
     *
     * <p>Use this callback to track changes to the displays if some functionality relies on an
     * association with some display properties.
     *
     * @param displayId The id of the display to which the view was moved.
     * @param config Configuration of the resources on new display after move.
