     * Gets the GNSS receiver internal hardware clock value in nanoseconds.
     *
     * <p>This value is expected to be monotonically increasing while the hardware clock remains
     * powered on. For the case of a hardware clock that is not continuously on, see the
     * {@link #getHardwareClockDiscontinuityCount} field. The GPS time can be derived by subtracting
     * the sum of {@link #getFullBiasNanos()} and {@link #getBiasNanos()} (when they are available)
     * from this value. Sub-nanosecond accuracy can be provided by means of {@link #getBiasNanos()}.
     *
     * <p>The error estimate for this value (if applicable) is {@link #getTimeUncertaintyNanos()}.
