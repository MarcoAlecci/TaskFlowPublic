     * Sets the number of items to prefetch in
     * {@link #collectInitialPrefetchPositions(int, LayoutPrefetchRegistry)}, which defines
     * how many inner items should be prefetched when this LayoutManager's RecyclerView
     * is nested inside another RecyclerView.
     *
     * <p>Set this value to the number of items this inner LayoutManager will display when it is
     * first scrolled into the viewport. RecyclerView will attempt to prefetch that number of items
     * so they are ready, avoiding jank as the inner RecyclerView is scrolled into the viewport.</p>
     *
     * <p>For example, take a vertically scrolling RecyclerView with horizontally scrolling inner
     * RecyclerViews. The rows always have 4 items visible in them (or 5 if not aligned). Passing
     * <code>4</code> to this method for each inner RecyclerView's LinearLayoutManager will enable
     * RecyclerView's prefetching feature to do create/bind work for 4 views within a row early,
     * before it is scrolled on screen, instead of just the default 2.</p>
     *
     * <p>Calling this method does nothing unless the LayoutManager is in a RecyclerView
     * nested in another RecyclerView.</p>
     *
     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Setting this value to be larger than the number of
     * views that will be visible in this view can incur unnecessary bind work, and an increase to
     * the number of Views created and in active use.</p>
