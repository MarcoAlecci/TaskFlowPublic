     * Legacy NfcAdapter getter, always use {@link #getDefaultAdapter(Context)} instead.<p>
     * This method was deprecated at API level 10 (Gingerbread MR1) because a context is required
     * for many NFC API methods. Those methods will fail when called on an NfcAdapter
     * object created from this method.<p>
     * @deprecated use {@link #getDefaultAdapter(Context)}
     * @hide
