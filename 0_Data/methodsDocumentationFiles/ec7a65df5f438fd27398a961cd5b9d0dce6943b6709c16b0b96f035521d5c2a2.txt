     * Called by a device owner or delegated app with {@link #DELEGATION_NETWORK_LOGGING} to
     * control the network logging feature.
     *
     * <p> Network logs contain DNS lookup and connect() library call events. The following library
     *     functions are recorded while network logging is active:
     *     <ul>
     *       <li>{@code getaddrinfo()}</li>
     *       <li>{@code gethostbyname()}</li>
     *       <li>{@code connect()}</li>
     *     </ul>
     *
     * <p> Network logging is a low-overhead tool for forensics but it is not guaranteed to use
     *     full system call logging; event reporting is enabled by default for all processes but not
     *     strongly enforced.
     *     Events from applications using alternative implementations of libc, making direct kernel
     *     calls, or deliberately obfuscating traffic may not be recorded.
     *
     * <p> Some common network events may not be reported. For example:
     *     <ul>
     *       <li>Applications may hardcode IP addresses to reduce the number of DNS lookups, or use
     *           an alternative system for name resolution, and so avoid calling
     *           {@code getaddrinfo()} or {@code gethostbyname}.</li>
     *       <li>Applications may use datagram sockets for performance reasons, for example
     *           for a game client. Calling {@code connect()} is unnecessary for this kind of
     *           socket, so it will not trigger a network event.</li>
     *     </ul>
     *
     * <p> It is possible to directly intercept layer 3 traffic leaving the device using an
     *     always-on VPN service.
     *     See {@link #setAlwaysOnVpnPackage(ComponentName, String, boolean)}
     *     and {@link android.net.VpnService} for details.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> The device owner won't be able to retrieve network logs if there
     * are unaffiliated secondary users or profiles on the device, regardless of whether the
     * feature is enabled. Logs will be discarded if the internal buffer fills up while waiting for
     * all users to become affiliated. Therefore it's recommended that affiliation ids are set for
     * new users as soon as possible after provisioning via {@link #setAffiliationIds}.
