     * When using collections (eg. {@link ListView}, {@link StackView} etc.) in widgets, it is very
     * costly to set PendingIntents on the individual items, and is hence not recommended. Instead
     * this method should be used to set a single PendingIntent template on the collection, and
     * individual items can differentiate their on-click behavior using
     * {@link RemoteViews#setOnClickFillInIntent(int, Intent)}.
     *
     * @param viewId The id of the collection who's children will use this PendingIntent template
     *          when clicked
     * @param pendingIntentTemplate The {@link PendingIntent} to be combined with extras specified
     *          by a child of viewId and executed when that child is clicked
