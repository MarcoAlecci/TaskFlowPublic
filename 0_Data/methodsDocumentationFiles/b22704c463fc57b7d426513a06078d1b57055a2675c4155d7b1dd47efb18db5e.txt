     * Controls whether this fragment should be shown in a dialog.  If not
     * set, no Dialog will be created in {@link #onActivityCreated(Bundle)},
     * and the fragment's view hierarchy will thus not be added to it.  This
     * allows you to instead use it as a normal fragment (embedded inside of
     * its activity).
     *
     * <p>This is normally set for you based on whether the fragment is
     * associated with a container view ID passed to
     * {@link FragmentTransaction#add(int, Fragment) FragmentTransaction.add(int, Fragment)}.
     * If the fragment was added with a container, setShowsDialog will be
     * initialized to false; otherwise, it will be true.
     *
     * @param showsDialog If true, the fragment will be displayed in a Dialog.
     * If false, no Dialog will be created and the fragment's view hierarchly
     * left undisturbed.
