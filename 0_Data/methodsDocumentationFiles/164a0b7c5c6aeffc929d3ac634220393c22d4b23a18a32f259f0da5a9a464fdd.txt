     * Returns {@code true} if the country has at least one time zone that uses UTC at the given
     * time. This is an efficient check when trying to validate received UTC offset information.
     * For example, there are situations when a detected zero UTC offset cannot be distinguished
     * from "no information available" or a corrupted signal. This method is useful because checking
     * offset information for large countries is relatively expensive but it is generally only the
     * countries close to the prime meridian that use UTC at <em>any</em> time of the year.
     *
     * @param whenMillis the time the offset information is for in milliseconds since the beginning
     *     of the Unix epoch
