     * Gets the hardware serial number, if available.
     *
     * <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Root access may allow you to modify device identifiers, such as
     * the hardware serial number. If you change these identifiers, you can use
     * <a href="/training/articles/security-key-attestation.html">key attestation</a> to obtain
     * proof of the device's original identifiers.
     *
     * <p>Starting with API level 29, persistent device identifiers are guarded behind additional
     * restrictions, and apps are recommended to use resettable identifiers (see <a
     * href="c"> Best practices for unique identifiers</a>). This method can be invoked if one of
     * the following requirements is met:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>If the calling app has been granted the READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission; this
     *     is a privileged permission that can only be granted to apps preloaded on the device.
     *     <li>If the calling app is the device or profile owner and has been granted the
     *     {@link Manifest.permission#READ_PHONE_STATE} permission. The profile owner is an app that
     *     owns a managed profile on the device; for more details see <a
     *     href="https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles">Work profiles</a>.
     *     Profile owner access is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
     *     <li>If the calling app has carrier privileges (see {@link
     *     android.telephony.TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges}) on any active subscription.
     *     <li>If the calling app is the default SMS role holder (see {@link
     *     android.app.role.RoleManager#isRoleHeld(String)}).
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the calling app does not meet one of these requirements then this method will behave
     * as follows:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>If the calling app's target SDK is API level 28 or lower and the app has the
     *     READ_PHONE_STATE permission then {@link Build#UNKNOWN} is returned.</li>
     *     <li>If the calling app's target SDK is API level 28 or lower and the app does not have
     *     the READ_PHONE_STATE permission, or if the calling app is targeting API level 29 or
     *     higher, then a SecurityException is thrown.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @return The serial number if specified.
