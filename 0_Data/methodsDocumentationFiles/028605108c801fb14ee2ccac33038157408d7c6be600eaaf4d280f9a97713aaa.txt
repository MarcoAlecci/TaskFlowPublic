     * Look up the dex metadata files for the given code paths building the map
     * [code path -> dex metadata].
     *
     * For each code path (.apk) the method checks if a matching dex metadata file (.dm) exists.
     * If it does it adds the pair to the returned map.
     *
     * Note that this method will do a loose
     * matching based on the extension ('foo.dm' will match 'foo.apk' or 'foo').
     *
     * This should only be used for code paths extracted from a package structure after the naming
     * was enforced in the installer.
