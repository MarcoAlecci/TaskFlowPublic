     * Retrieve the non-configuration instance data that was previously
     * returned by {@link #onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()}.  This will
     * be available from the initial {@link #onCreate} and
     * {@link #onStart} calls to the new instance, allowing you to extract
     * any useful dynamic state from the previous instance.
     *
     * <p>Note that the data you retrieve here should <em>only</em> be used
     * as an optimization for handling configuration changes.  You should always
     * be able to handle getting a null pointer back, and an activity must
     * still be able to restore itself to its previous state (through the
     * normal {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} mechanism) even if this
     * function returns null.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> For most cases you should use the {@link Fragment} API
     * {@link Fragment#setRetainInstance(boolean)} instead; this is also
     * available on older platforms through the Android support libraries.

     * @return the object previously returned by {@link #onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()}
