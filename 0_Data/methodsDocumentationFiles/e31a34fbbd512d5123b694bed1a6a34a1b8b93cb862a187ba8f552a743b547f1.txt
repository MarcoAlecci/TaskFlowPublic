     * Obtains an instance of {@code OffsetTime} from an {@code Instant} and zone ID.
     * <p>
     * This creates an offset time with the same instant as that specified.
     * Finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich is simple as there is only one valid
     * offset for each instant.
     * <p>
     * The date component of the instant is dropped during the conversion.
     * This means that the conversion can never fail due to the instant being
     * out of the valid range of dates.
     *
     * @param instant  the instant to create the time from, not null
     * @param zone  the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null
     * @return the offset time, not null
