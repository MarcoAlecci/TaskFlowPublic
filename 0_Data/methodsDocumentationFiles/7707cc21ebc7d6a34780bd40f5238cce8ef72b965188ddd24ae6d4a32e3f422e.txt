     * Return the current display metrics that are in effect for this resource
     * object. The returned object should be treated as read-only.
     *
     * <p>Note that the reported value may be different than the window this application is
     * interested in.</p>
     *
     * <p>Best practices are to obtain metrics from {@link WindowManager#getCurrentWindowMetrics()}
     * for window bounds, {@link Display#getRealMetrics(DisplayMetrics)} for display bounds and
     * obtain density from {@link Configuration#densityDpi}. The value obtained from this API may be
     * wrong if the {@link Resources} is from the context which is different than the window is
     * attached such as {@link Application#getResources()}.
