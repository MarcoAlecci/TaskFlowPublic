     * <p>Indicates whether pixels stored in this bitmaps are stored pre-multiplied.
     * When a pixel is pre-multiplied, the RGB components have been multiplied by
     * the alpha component. For instance, if the original color is a 50%
     * translucent red <code>(128, 255, 0, 0)</code>, the pre-multiplied form is
     * <code>(128, 128, 0, 0)</code>.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method always returns false if {@link #getConfig()} is
     * {@link Bitmap.Config#RGB_565}.</p>
     *
     * <p>The return value is undefined if {@link #getConfig()} is
     * {@link Bitmap.Config#ALPHA_8}.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method only returns true if {@link #hasAlpha()} returns true.
     * A bitmap with no alpha channel can be used both as a pre-multiplied and
     * as a non pre-multiplied bitmap.</p>
     *
     * <p>Only pre-multiplied bitmaps may be drawn by the view system or
     * {@link Canvas}. If a non-pre-multiplied bitmap with an alpha channel is
     * drawn to a Canvas, a RuntimeException will be thrown.</p>
     *
     * @return true if the underlying pixels have been pre-multiplied, false
