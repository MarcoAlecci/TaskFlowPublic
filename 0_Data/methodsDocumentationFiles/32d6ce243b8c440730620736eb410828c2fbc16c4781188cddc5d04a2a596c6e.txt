     * Given a touchable region of a child, this method reduces region by the bounds of all views on
     * top of the child for which {@link View#canReceivePointerEvents} returns {@code true}. This
     * applies recursively for all views in the view hierarchy on top of this one.
     *
     * @param touchableRegion The touchable region we want to modify.
     * @param view A child view of this ViewGroup which indicates the z-order of the touchable
     *             region.
     * @hide
