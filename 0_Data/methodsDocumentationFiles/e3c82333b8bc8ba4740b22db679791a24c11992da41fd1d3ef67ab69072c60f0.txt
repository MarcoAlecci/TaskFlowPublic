     * Returns the {@link JsonToken#NUMBER long} value of the next token,
     * consuming it. If the next token is a string, this method will attempt to
     * parse it as a long. If the next token's numeric value cannot be exactly
     * represented by a Java {@code long}, this method throws.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the next token is not a literal value.
     * @throws NumberFormatException if the next literal value cannot be parsed
     *     as a number, or exactly represented as a long.
