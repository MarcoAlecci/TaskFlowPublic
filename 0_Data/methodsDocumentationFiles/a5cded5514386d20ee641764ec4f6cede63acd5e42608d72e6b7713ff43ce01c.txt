     * Acquire a frame rate flexibility token, which allows surface flinger to freely switch display
     * frame rates. This is used by CTS tests to put the device in a consistent state. See
     * ISurfaceComposer::acquireFrameRateFlexibilityToken(). The caller must have the
     * ACCESS_SURFACE_FLINGER permission, or else the call will fail, returning 0.
