     * Called to inform the input method that text input has finished in
     * the last editor.  At this point there may be a call to
     * {@link #onStartInput(EditorInfo, boolean)} to perform input in a
     * new editor, or the input method may be left idle.  This method is
     * <em>not</em> called when input restarts in the same editor.
     * 
     * <p>The default
     * implementation uses the InputConnection to clear any active composing
     * text; you can override this (not calling the base class implementation)
     * to perform whatever behavior you would like.
