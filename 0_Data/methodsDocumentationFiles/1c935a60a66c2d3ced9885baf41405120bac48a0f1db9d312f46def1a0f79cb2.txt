     * Returns an Intent which can be used by the default launcher to pin a shortcut containing the
     * given {@link ShortcutInfo}. This method should be used by an Activity to set a result in
     * response to {@link Intent#ACTION_CREATE_SHORTCUT}.
     *
     * @param shortcut New shortcut to pin.  If an app wants to pin an existing (either dynamic
     *     or manifest) shortcut, then it only needs to have an ID, and other fields don't have to
     *     be set, in which case, the target shortcut must be enabled.
     *     If it's a new shortcut, all the mandatory fields, such as a short label, must be
     *     set.
     * @return The intent that should be set as the result for the calling activity, or
     *     <code>null</code> if the current launcher doesn't support shortcuts.
     *
     * @see Intent#ACTION_CREATE_SHORTCUT
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if a shortcut with the same ID exists and is disabled.
