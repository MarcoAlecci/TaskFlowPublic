         * <p>Copies the inverse transform of this color space in specified array.
         * The inverse transform is used to convert from XYZ to RGB (with the
         * same white point as this color space). To connect color spaces, you
         * must first {@link ColorSpace#adapt(ColorSpace, float[]) adapt} them
         * to the same white point.</p>
         * <p>It is recommended to use {@link ColorSpace#connect(ColorSpace, ColorSpace)}
         * to convert between color spaces.</p>
         *
         * @param inverseTransform The destination array, cannot be null, its length
