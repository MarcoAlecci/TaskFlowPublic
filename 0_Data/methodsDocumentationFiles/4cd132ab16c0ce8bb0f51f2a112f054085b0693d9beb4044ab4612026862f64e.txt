     * Called each time a new batch of network logs can be retrieved. This callback method will only
     * ever be called when network logging is enabled. The logs can only be retrieved while network
     * logging is enabled.
     *
     * <p>If a secondary user or profile is created, this callback won't be received until all users
     * become affiliated again (even if network logging is enabled). It will also no longer be
     * possible to retrieve the network logs batch with the most recent {@code batchToken} provided
     * by this callback. See {@link DevicePolicyManager#setAffiliationIds}.
     *
     * <p>This callback is only applicable to device owners.
