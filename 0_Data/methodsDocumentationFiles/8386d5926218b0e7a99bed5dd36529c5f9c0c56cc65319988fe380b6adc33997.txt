     * Remove an IPsec transform from a stream socket.
     *
     * <p>Once removed, traffic on the socket will not be encrypted. Removing transforms from a
     * socket allows the socket to be reused for communication in the clear.
     *
     * <p>If an {@code IpSecTransform} object applied to this socket was deallocated by calling
     * {@link IpSecTransform#close()}, then communication on the socket will fail until this method
     * is called.
     *
     * @param socket a socket that previously had a transform applied to it
     * @throws IOException indicating that the transform could not be removed from the socket
