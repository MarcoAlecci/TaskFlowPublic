         * Implementation note: The serialized form for the intent list also contains the name
         * of the concrete class that's stored in the list, and assumes that every element of the
         * list is of the same type. This is very similar to the original parcelable mechanism.
         * We cannot use that directly because IntentInfo extends IntentFilter, which is parcelable
         * and is public API. It also declares Parcelable related methods as final which means
         * we can't extend them. The approach of using composition instead of inheritance leads to
         * a large set of cascading changes in the PackageManagerService, which seem undesirable.

         * <b>WARNING: </b> The list of objects returned by this function might need to be fixed up
         * to make sure their owner fields are consistent. See {@code fixupOwner}.
