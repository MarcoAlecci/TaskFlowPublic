     * Similar to {@link #setNotificationUri(ContentResolver, Uri)}, except this version allows
     * to watch multiple content URIs for changes.
     *
     * <p>If this is not implemented, this is equivalent to calling
     * {@link #setNotificationUri(ContentResolver, Uri)} with the first URI in {@code uris}.
     *
     * <p>Calling this overrides any previous call to
     * {@link #setNotificationUri(ContentResolver, Uri)}.
     *
     * @param cr The content resolver from the caller's context. The listener attached to
     * this resolver will be notified.
     * @param uris The content URIs to watch.
