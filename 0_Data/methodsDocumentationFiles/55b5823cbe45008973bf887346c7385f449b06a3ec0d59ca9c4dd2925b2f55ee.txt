     * <p>Connects the specified color spaces to sRGB.
     * If the source color space does not use CIE XYZ D65 as its profile
     * connection space, the two spaces are chromatically adapted to use the
     * CIE standard illuminant {@link #ILLUMINANT_D50 D50} as needed.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the source is the sRGB color space, an optimized connector
     * is returned to avoid unnecessary computations and loss of precision.</p>
     *
     * <p>Colors are mapped from the source color space to the destination color
     * space using the {@link RenderIntent#PERCEPTUAL perceptual} render intent.</p>

     * @param source The color space to convert colors from
     * @return A non-null connector between the specified color space and sRGB
