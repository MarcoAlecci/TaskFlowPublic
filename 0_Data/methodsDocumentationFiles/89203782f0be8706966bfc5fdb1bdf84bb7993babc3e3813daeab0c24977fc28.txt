     * Controls the visibility of the extracted text area.  This only applies
     * when the input method is in fullscreen mode, and thus showing extracted
     * text.  When false, the extracted text will not be shown, allowing some
     * of the application to be seen behind.  This is normally set for you
     * by {@link #onUpdateExtractingVisibility}.  This controls the visibility
     * of both the extracted text and candidate view; the latter since it is
     * not useful if there is no text to see.
