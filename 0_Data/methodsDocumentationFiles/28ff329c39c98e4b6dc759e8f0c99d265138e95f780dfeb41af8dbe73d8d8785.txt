     * Called when a translucent activity over this activity is becoming opaque or another
     * activity is being launched. Activities that override this method must call
     * <code>super.onVisibleBehindCanceled()</code> or a SuperNotCalledException will be thrown.
     *
     * <p>When this method is called the activity has 500 msec to release any resources it may be
     * using while visible in the background.
     * If the activity has not returned from this method in 500 msec the system will destroy
     * the activity and kill the process in order to recover the resources for another
     * process. Otherwise {@link #onStop()} will be called following return.
     *
     * @see #requestVisibleBehind(boolean)
     *
     * @deprecated This method's functionality is no longer supported as of
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O} and will be removed in a future release.
