     * Scenes that are not defined with layout resources or
     * hierarchies, or which need to perform additional steps
     * after those hierarchies are changed to, should set an enter
     * action, and possibly an exit action as well. An enter action
     * will cause Scene to call back into application code to do
     * anything else the application needs after transitions have
     * captured pre-change values and after any other scene changes
     * have been applied, such as the layout (if any) being added to
     * the view hierarchy. After this method is called, Transitions will
     * be played.
     *
     * @param action The runnable whose {@link Runnable#run() run()} method will
     * be called when this scene is entered
     * @see #setExitAction(Runnable)
     * @see Scene#Scene(ViewGroup, View)
