     * Return whether the given user is actively running.  This means that
     * the user is in the "started" state, not "stopped" -- it is currently
     * allowed to run code through scheduled alarms, receiving broadcasts,
     * etc.  A started user may be either the current foreground user or a
     * background user; the result here does not distinguish between the two.
     * @param userId the user's id. Zero indicates the default user.
