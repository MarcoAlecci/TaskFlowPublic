     * Apply this matrix to the array of 2D vectors, and write the transformed vectors back into the
     * array. Note: this method does not apply the translation associated with the matrix. Use
     * {@link Matrix#mapPoints(float[])} if you want the translation to be applied.
     *
     * @param vecs The array [x0, y0, x1, y1, ...] of vectors to transform.
