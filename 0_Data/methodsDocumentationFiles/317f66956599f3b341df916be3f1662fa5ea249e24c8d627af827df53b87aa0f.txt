     * When <code>resizeClip</code> is true, ChangeBounds resizes the view using the clipBounds
     * instead of changing the dimensions of the view during the animation. When
     * <code>resizeClip</code> is false, ChangeBounds resizes the View by changing its dimensions.
     *
     * <p>When resizeClip is set to true, the clip bounds is modified by ChangeBounds. Therefore,
     * {@link android.transition.ChangeClipBounds} is not compatible with ChangeBounds
     * in this mode.</p>
     *
     * @param resizeClip Used to indicate whether the view bounds should be modified or the
     *                   clip bounds should be modified by ChangeBounds.
