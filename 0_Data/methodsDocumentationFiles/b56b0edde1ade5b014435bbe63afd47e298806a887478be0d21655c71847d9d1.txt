     * Requests bandwidth update for a given {@link Network} and returns whether the update request
     * is accepted by ConnectivityService. Once accepted, ConnectivityService will poll underlying
     * network connection for updated bandwidth information. The caller will be notified via
     * {@link ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback} if there is an update. Notice that this
     * method assumes that the caller has previously called
     * {@link #registerNetworkCallback(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)} to listen for network
     * changes.
     *
     * @param network {@link Network} specifying which network you're interested.
     * @return {@code true} on success, {@code false} if the {@link Network} is no longer valid.
