     * @return A modified copy of this WindowInsets
     * @deprecated Consuming of different parts individually of a {@link WindowInsets} instance is
     * deprecated, since {@link WindowInsets} contains many different insets. Use {@link #CONSUMED}
     * instead to stop dispatching insets. On {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R R}, this
     * method has no effect.
