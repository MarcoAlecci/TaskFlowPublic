     * Sets the LayoutTransition object for this ViewGroup. If the LayoutTransition object is
     * not null, changes in layout which occur because of children being added to or removed from
     * the ViewGroup will be animated according to the animations defined in that LayoutTransition
     * object. By default, the transition object is null (so layout changes are not animated).
     *
     * <p>Replacing a non-null transition will cause that previous transition to be
     * canceled, if it is currently running, to restore this container to
     * its correct post-transition state.</p>
     *
     * @param transition The LayoutTransition object that will animated changes in layout. A value
     * of <code>null</code> means no transition will run on layout changes.
     * @attr ref android.R.styleable#ViewGroup_animateLayoutChanges
