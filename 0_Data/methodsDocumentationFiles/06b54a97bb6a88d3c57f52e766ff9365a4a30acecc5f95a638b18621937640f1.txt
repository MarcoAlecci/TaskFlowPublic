     * Read a record's raw data from the restore stream.  The record's header must first
     * have been processed by the {@link #readNextHeader()} method.  Multiple calls to
     * this method may be made in order to process the data in chunks; not all of it
     * must be read in a single call.  Once all of the raw data for the current entity
     * has been read, further calls to this method will simply return zero.
     *
     * @param data An allocated byte array of at least 'size' bytes
     * @param offset Offset within the 'data' array at which the data will be placed
     *    when read from the stream
     * @param size The number of bytes to read in this pass
     * @return The number of bytes of data read.  Once all of the data for this entity
     *    has been read, further calls to this method will return zero.
     * @throws IOException if an error occurred when trying to read the restore data stream
