         * Returns the supported range of encoder complexity values.
         * <p>
         * Some codecs may support multiple complexity levels, where higher
         * complexity values use more encoder tools (e.g. perform more
         * intensive calculations) to improve the quality or the compression
         * ratio.  Use a lower value to save power and/or time.
