     * <p>Returns a subset of the list returned by {@link #getKeys} with all keys that
     * require camera clients to obtain the {@link android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA} permission.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>If an application calls {@link CameraManager#getCameraCharacteristics} without holding the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA} permission,
     * all keys in this list will not be available, and calling {@link #get} will
     * return null for those keys. If the application obtains the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA} permission, then the
     * CameraCharacteristics from a call to a subsequent
     * {@link CameraManager#getCameraCharacteristics} will have the keys available.</p>
     *
     * <p>The list returned is not modifiable, so any attempts to modify it will throw
     * a {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Each key is only listed once in the list. The order of the keys is undefined.</p>
     *
     * @return List of camera characteristic keys that require the
     *         {@link android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA} permission. The list can be empty in case
     *         there are no currently present keys that need additional permission.
