     * Register a component to be the sole receiver of MEDIA_BUTTON intents.
     * @param eventReceiver identifier of a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver}
     *      that will receive the media button intent. This broadcast receiver must be declared
     *      in the application manifest. The package of the component must match that of
     *      the context you're registering from.
     * @deprecated Use {@link MediaSession#setMediaButtonReceiver(PendingIntent)} instead.
