     * Return whether the data network is currently active.  An active network means that
     * it is currently in a high power state for performing data transmission.  On some
     * types of networks, it may be expensive to move and stay in such a state, so it is
     * more power efficient to batch network traffic together when the radio is already in
     * this state.  This method tells you whether right now is currently a good time to
     * initiate network traffic, as the network is already active.
