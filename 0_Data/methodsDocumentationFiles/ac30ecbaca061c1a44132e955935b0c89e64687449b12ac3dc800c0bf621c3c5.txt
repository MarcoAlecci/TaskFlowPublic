     * <p>Play one of the predefined platform sounds for media actions.</p>
     *
     * <p>Use this method to play a platform-specific sound for various media
     * actions. The sound playback is done asynchronously, with the same
     * behavior and content as the sounds played by
     * {@link android.hardware.Camera#takePicture Camera.takePicture},
     * {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#start MediaRecorder.start}, and
     * {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#stop MediaRecorder.stop}.</p>
     *
     * <p>With the {@link android.hardware.camera2 camera2} API, this method can be used to play
     * standard camera operation sounds with the appropriate system behavior for such sounds.</p>

     * <p>With the older {@link android.hardware.Camera} API, using this method makes it easy to
     * match the default device sounds when recording or capturing data through the preview
     * callbacks, or when implementing custom camera-like features in your application.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the sound has not been loaded by {@link #load} before calling play,
     * play will load the sound at the cost of some additional latency before
     * sound playback begins. </p>
