     * Called by an application that is administering the device to set the minimum allowed password
     * length. After setting this, the user will not be able to enter a new password that is not at
     * least as restrictive as what has been set. Note that the current password will remain until
     * the user has set a new one, so the change does not take place immediately. To prompt the user
     * for a new password, use {@link #ACTION_SET_NEW_PASSWORD} or
     * {@link #ACTION_SET_NEW_PARENT_PROFILE_PASSWORD} after setting this value. This constraint is
     * only imposed if the administrator has also requested either {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_NUMERIC}
     * , {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_NUMERIC_COMPLEX}, {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_ALPHABETIC},
     * {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_ALPHANUMERIC}, or {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_COMPLEX} with
     * {@link #setPasswordQuality}. If an app targeting SDK level
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R} and above enforces this constraint without settings
     * password quality to one of these values first, this method will throw
     * {@link IllegalStateException}.
     * <p>
     * On devices not supporting {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_SECURE_LOCK_SCREEN} feature, the
     * password is always treated as empty.
     * <p>
     * The calling device admin must have requested
     * {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_LIMIT_PASSWORD} to be able to call this method; if it has
     * not, a security exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to set restrictions on the parent
     * profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param length The new desired minimum password length. A value of 0 means there is no
     *     restriction.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not an active administrator or {@code admin}
     *     does not use {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_LIMIT_PASSWORD}
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the calling app is targeting SDK level
     *     {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R} and above and didn't set a sufficient password
     *     quality requirement prior to calling this method.
