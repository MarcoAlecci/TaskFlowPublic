         * <p>Gets the distances from the camera to where an object appears to be
         * in focus. The object is sharpest at the optimal focus distance. The
         * depth of field is the far focus distance minus near focus distance.</p>
         *
         * <p>Focus distances may change after calling {@link
         * #autoFocus(AutoFocusCallback)}, {@link #cancelAutoFocus}, or {@link
         * #startPreview()}. Applications can call {@link #getParameters()}
         * and this method anytime to get the latest focus distances. If the
         * focus mode is FOCUS_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO, focus distances may change
         * from time to time.</p>
         *
         * <p>This method is intended to estimate the distance between the camera
         * and the subject. After autofocus, the subject distance may be within
         * near and far focus distance. However, the precision depends on the
         * camera hardware, autofocus algorithm, the focus area, and the scene.
         * The error can be large and it should be only used as a reference.</p>
         *
         * <p>Far focus distance >= optimal focus distance >= near focus distance.
         * If the focus distance is infinity, the value will be
         * {@code Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY}.</p>

         * @param output focus distances in meters. output must be a float
         *        array with three elements. Near focus distance, optimal focus
         *        distance, and far focus distance will be filled in the array.
