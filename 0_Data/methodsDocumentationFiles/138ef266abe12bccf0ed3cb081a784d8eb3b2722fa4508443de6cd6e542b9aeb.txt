     * this parser is strict and only accepts JSON as specified by <a
     * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">RFC 4627</a>. Setting the
     * parser to lenient causes it to ignore the following syntax errors:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>End of line comments starting with {@code //} or {@code #} and
     *       ending with a newline character.
     *   <li>C-style comments starting with {@code /*} and ending with
     *       {@code *}{@code /}. Such comments may not be nested.
     *   <li>Names that are unquoted or {@code 'single quoted'}.
     *   <li>Strings that are unquoted or {@code 'single quoted'}.
     *   <li>Array elements separated by {@code ;} instead of {@code ,}.
     *   <li>Unnecessary array separators. These are interpreted as if null
     *       was the omitted value.
     *   <li>Names and values separated by {@code =} or {@code =>} instead of
     *       {@code :}.
     *   <li>Name/value pairs separated by {@code ;} instead of {@code ,}.
     * </ul>
