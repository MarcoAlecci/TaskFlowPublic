     * Returns {@code true} if encryption using this key must be sufficiently randomized to produce
     * different ciphertexts for the same plaintext every time. The formal cryptographic property
     * being required is <em>indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack ({@code
     * IND-CPA})</em>. This property is important because it mitigates several classes of
     * weaknesses due to which ciphertext may leak information about plaintext. For example, if a
     * given plaintext always produces the same ciphertext, an attacker may see the repeated
     * ciphertexts and be able to deduce something about the plaintext.
