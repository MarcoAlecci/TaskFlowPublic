     * Notifies the engine that it should load a speech synthesis voice. There is no guarantee
     * that this method is always called before the voice is used for synthesis. It is merely
     * a hint to the engine that it will probably get some synthesis requests for this voice
     * at some point in the future.
     *
     * Will be called only on synthesis thread.
     *
     * The default implementation creates a Locale from the voice name (by interpreting the name as
     * a BCP-47 tag for the locale), and passes it to
     * {@link #onLoadLanguage(String, String, String)}.
     *
     * @param voiceName Name of the voice.
     * @return {@link TextToSpeech#ERROR} or {@link TextToSpeech#SUCCESS}.
