     * @exception InvalidKeySpecException if the requested key specification is
     * inappropriate for the given key (e.g., the algorithms associated with
     * <code>key</code> and <code>keySpec</code> do not match, or
     * <code>key</code> references a key on a cryptographic hardware device
     * whereas <code>keySpec</code> is the specification of a software-based
