     * the given {@link UserInfoFlag}s.

     * <p>The userInfoFlag can contain GUEST, RESTRICTED, MANAGED_PROFILE, DEMO, or else be

     * It can contain other UserInfoFlag properties (like EPHEMERAL), which will be ignored here.

     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if userInfoFlag is more than one type of user or if it
     *                                  is a SYSTEM user.
