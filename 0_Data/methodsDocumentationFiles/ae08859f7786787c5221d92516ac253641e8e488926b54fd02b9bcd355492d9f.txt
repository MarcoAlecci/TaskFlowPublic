         * Sets the value of a field using an <a href="#Filtering">explicit filter</a>.
         *
         * <p>This method is typically used when the dataset requires authentication and the service
         * does not know its value but wants to hide the dataset after the user enters a minimum
         * number of characters. For example, if the dataset represents a credit card number and the
         * service does not want to show the "Tap to authenticate" message until the user tapped
         * 4 digits, in which case the filter would be {@code Pattern.compile("\\d.{4,}")}.
         *
         * <p><b>Note:</b> If the dataset requires authentication but the service knows its text
         * value it's easier to filter by calling {@link #setValue(AutofillId, AutofillValue)} and
         * use the value to filter.

         * @param id id returned by {@link
         *         android.app.assist.AssistStructure.ViewNode#getAutofillId()}.
         * @param value the value to be autofilled. Pass {@code null} if you do not have the value
         *        but the target view is a logical part of the dataset. For example, if
         *        the dataset needs authentication and you have no access to the value.
         * @param filter regex used to determine if the dataset should be shown in the autofill UI;
         *        when {@code null}, it disables filtering on that dataset (this is the recommended
         *        approach when {@code value} is not {@code null} and field contains sensitive data
         *        such as passwords).
