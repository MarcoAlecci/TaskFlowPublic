     * <p> For example, refer to {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_OUT_MONO},
     * {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_OUT_STEREO}, {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_OUT_5POINT1}.
     * This method may return {@link AudioFormat#CHANNEL_INVALID} if
     * a channel index mask was used. Consider
     * {@link #getFormat()} instead, to obtain an {@link AudioFormat},
     * which contains both the channel position mask and the channel index mask.
