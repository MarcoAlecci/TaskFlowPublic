         * <p>
         * Split removals occur prior to adding new APKs. If upgrading a feature
         * split, it is not expected nor desirable to remove the split prior to
         * upgrading.
         * <p>
         * When split removal is bundled with new APKs, the packageName must be
         * identical.
