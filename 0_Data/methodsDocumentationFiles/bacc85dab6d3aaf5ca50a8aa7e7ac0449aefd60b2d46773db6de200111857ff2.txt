     * Start a new activity and wait for it to begin running before returning.
     * In addition to being synchronous, this method as some semantic
     * differences from the standard {@link Context#startActivity} call: the
     * activity component is resolved before talking with the activity manager
     * (its class name is specified in the Intent that this method ultimately
     * starts), and it does not allow you to start activities that run in a
     * different process.  In addition, if the given Intent resolves to
     * multiple activities, instead of displaying a dialog for the user to
     * select an activity, an exception will be thrown.
     *
     * <p>The function returns as soon as the activity goes idle following the
     * call to its {@link Activity#onCreate}.  Generally this means it has gone
     * through the full initialization including {@link Activity#onResume} and
     * drawn and displayed its initial window.
     *
     * @param intent Description of the activity to start.
     * @param options Additional options for how the Activity should be started.
     * May be null if there are no options.  See {@link android.app.ActivityOptions}
     * for how to build the Bundle supplied here; there are no supported definitions
     * for building it manually.
