     * Set all of the properties for a specific namespace. Pre-existing properties will be updated
     * and new properties will be added if necessary. Any pre-existing properties for the specific
     * namespace which are not part of the provided {@link Properties} object will be deleted from
     * the namespace. These changes are all applied atomically, such that no calls to read or reset
     * these properties can happen in the middle of this update.
     * <p>
     * Each call to {@link #getProperties(String, String...)} is also atomic and ensures that either
     * none or all of this update is picked up, but never only part of it.
     *
     * @param properties the complete set of properties to set for a specific namespace.
     * @throws BadConfigException if the provided properties are banned by RescueParty.
     * @return True if the values were set, false otherwise.
