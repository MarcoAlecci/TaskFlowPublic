     * Send the given UTF-16 character to the current input connection.  Most
     * characters will be delivered simply by calling
     * {@link InputConnection#commitText InputConnection.commitText()} with
     * the character; some, however, may be handled different.  In particular,
     * the enter character ('\n') will either be delivered as an action code
     * or a raw key event, as appropriate.  Consider this as a convenience
     * method for IMEs that do not have a full implementation of actions; a
     * fully complying IME will decide of the right action for each event and
     * will likely never call this method except maybe to handle events coming
     * from an actual hardware keyboard.
     * 
     * @param charCode The UTF-16 character code to send.
