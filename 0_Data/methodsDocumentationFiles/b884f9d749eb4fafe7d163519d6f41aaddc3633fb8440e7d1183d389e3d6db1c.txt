     * Register a marshal queryable for the managed type {@code T}.
     *
     * <p>Multiple marshal queryables for the same managed type {@code T} may be registered;
     * this is desirable if they support different native types (e.g. marshaler 1 supports
     * {@code Integer <-> TYPE_INT32}, marshaler 2 supports {@code Integer <-> TYPE_BYTE}.</p>
     *
     * @param queryable a non-{@code null} marshal queryable that supports marshaling {@code T}
