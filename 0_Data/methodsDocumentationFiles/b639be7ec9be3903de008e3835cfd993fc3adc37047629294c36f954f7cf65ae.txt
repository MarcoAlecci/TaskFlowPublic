     * Get the estimated bearing accuracy of this location, in degrees.
     *
     * <p>We define bearing accuracy at 68% confidence.  Specifically, as 1-side of the
     * 2-sided range on each side of the estimated bearing reported by {@link #getBearing()},
     * within which there is a 68% probability of finding the true bearing.
     *
     * <p>In the case where the underlying distribution is assumed Gaussian normal, this would be
     * considered 1 standard deviation.
     *
     * <p>For example, if {@link #getBearing()} returns 60, and
     * {@link #getBearingAccuracyDegrees()} returns 10, then there is a 68% probability of the
     * true bearing being between 50 and 70 degrees.
     *
     * <p>If this location does not have a bearing accuracy, then 0.0 is returned.
