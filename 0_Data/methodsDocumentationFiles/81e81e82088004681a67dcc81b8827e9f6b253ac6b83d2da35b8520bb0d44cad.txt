         * Sets recording mode hint. This tells the camera that the intent of
         * the application is to record videos {@link
         * android.media.MediaRecorder#start()}, not to take still pictures
         * {@link #takePicture(Camera.ShutterCallback, Camera.PictureCallback,
         * Camera.PictureCallback, Camera.PictureCallback)}. Using this hint can
         * allow MediaRecorder.start() to start faster or with fewer glitches on
         * output. This should be called before starting preview for the best
         * result, but can be changed while the preview is active. The default
         * value is false.
         *
         * The app can still call takePicture() when the hint is true or call
         * MediaRecorder.start() when the hint is false. But the performance may
         * be worse.
         *
         * @param hint true if the apps intend to record videos using
         *             {@link android.media.MediaRecorder}.
