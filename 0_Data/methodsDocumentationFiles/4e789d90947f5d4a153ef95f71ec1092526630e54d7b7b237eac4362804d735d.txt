     * An indication of which package is being restored currently, out of the
     * total number provided in the {@link #restoreStarting(int)} callback.  This method
     * is not guaranteed to be called: if the transport is unable to obtain
     * data for one or more of the requested packages, no onUpdate() call will
     * occur for those packages.
     *
     * @param nowBeingRestored The index, between 1 and the numPackages parameter
     *   to the {@link #restoreStarting(int)} callback, of the package now being
     *   restored.  This may be non-monotonic; it is intended purely as a rough
     *   indication of the backup manager's progress through the overall restore process.
     * @param currentPackage The name of the package now being restored.
