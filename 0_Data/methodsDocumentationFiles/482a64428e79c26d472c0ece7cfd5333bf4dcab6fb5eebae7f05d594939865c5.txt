     * Creates an mmap of the SharedMemory with the specified prot, offset, and length. This will
     * always produce a new ByteBuffer window to the backing shared memory region. Every call
     * to map() may be paired with a call to {@link #unmap(ByteBuffer)} when the ByteBuffer
     * returned by map() is no longer needed.
     *
     * @param prot A bitwise-or'd combination of PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, PROT_EXEC, or PROT_NONE.
     * @param offset The offset into the shared memory to begin mapping. Must be >= 0 and less than
     *         getSize().
     * @param length The length of the region to map. Must be > 0 and offset + length must not
     *         exceed getSize().
     * @return A ByteBuffer mapping.
     * @throws ErrnoException if the mmap call failed.
