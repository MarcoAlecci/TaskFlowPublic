     * @param muteArray an array of booleans to specify which MIDI tracks are muted. The value at
     *    index 0 affects track 0, value at index 1 affects track 1 etc. 
     *    The length of the array must be {@link #getMaxTracks()} for the call to succeed.
     * @param sync if false, the new mute flags will be applied as soon as possible by the JET
     *    render and playback engine. If true, the mute flags will be updated at the start of the
     *    next segment. If the segment is repeated, the flags will take effect the next time 
     *    segment is repeated.
     * @return true if the mute flags were successfully updated, false otherwise.
