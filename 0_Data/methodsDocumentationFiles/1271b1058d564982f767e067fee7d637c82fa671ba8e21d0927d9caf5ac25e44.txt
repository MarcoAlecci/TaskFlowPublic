     * Returns the path's convexity, as defined by the content of the path.
     * <p>
     * A path is convex if it has a single contour, and only ever curves in a
     * single direction.
     * <p>
     * This function will calculate the convexity of the path from its control
     * points, and cache the result.
     *
     * @return True if the path is convex.
     *
     * @deprecated This method is not reliable. The way convexity is computed may change from
     * release to release, and convexity could change based on a matrix as well. This method was
     * useful when non-convex Paths were unable to be used in certain contexts, but that is no
     * longer the case.
