     * Kill the process with the given PID.
     * Note that, though this API allows us to request to
     * kill any process based on its PID, the kernel will
     * still impose standard restrictions on which PIDs you
     * are actually able to kill.  Typically this means only
     * the process running the caller's packages/application
     * and any additional processes created by that app; packages
     * sharing a common UID will also be able to kill each
     * other's processes.
