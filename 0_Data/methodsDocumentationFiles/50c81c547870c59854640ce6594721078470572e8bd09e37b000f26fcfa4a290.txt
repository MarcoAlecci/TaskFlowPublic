     * compatible with this platform, populates {@code outError[0]} with an
     * error message.
     * <p>
     * If {@code minCode} is not specified, e.g. the value is {@code null},
     * then behavior varies based on the {@code platformSdkVersion}:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the platform SDK version is greater than or equal to the
     * {@code minVers}, returns the {@code mniVers} unmodified.
     * <li>Otherwise, returns -1 to indicate that the package is not
     * compatible with this platform.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, the behavior varies based on whether the current platform
     * is a pre-release version, e.g. the {@code platformSdkCodenames} array
     * has length > 0:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If this is a pre-release platform and the value specified by
     * {@code targetCode} is contained within the array of allowed pre-release
     * codenames, this method will return {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#CUR_DEVELOPMENT}.
     * <li>If this is a released platform, this method will return -1 to
     * indicate that the package is not compatible with this platform.
