     * Finds the canonical path for the requested document. The path must start
     * from the parent document if parentDocumentId is not null or the root document
     * if parentDocumentId is null. If there are more than one path to this document,
     * return the most typical one. Include both the parent document or root document
     * and the requested document in the returned path.
     *
     * <p>This API assumes that document ID has enough info to infer the root.
     * Different roots should use different document ID to refer to the same
     * document.
     *
     *
     * @param parentDocumentId the document from which the path starts if not null,
     *     or null to indicate a path from the root is requested.
     * @param childDocumentId the document which path is requested.
     * @return the path of the requested document. If parentDocumentId is null
     *     returned root ID must not be null. If parentDocumentId is not null
     *     returned root ID must be null.
     * @throws AuthenticationRequiredException If authentication is required from
     *            the user (such as login credentials), but it is not guaranteed
     *            that the client will handle this properly.
