     * pop of the back stack. This Transition acts in the leaving Fragment.

     * {@link android.transition.ChangeBounds}. A null
     * value will cause transferred shared elements to blink to the final position.
     * If no value is set, the default will be to use the same value as
     * {@link #setSharedElementEnterTransition(android.transition.Transition)}.
