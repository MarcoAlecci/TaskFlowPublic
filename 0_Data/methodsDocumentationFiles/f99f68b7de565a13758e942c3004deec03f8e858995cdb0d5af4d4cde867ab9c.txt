         * Defines the behavior of the magnifier when it is requested to position outside the
         * surface of the main application window. The default value is {@code true}, which means
         * that the position will be adjusted such that the magnifier will be fully within the
         * bounds of the main application window, while also avoiding any overlap with system insets
         * (such as the one corresponding to the status bar). If this flag is set to {@code false},
         * the area where the magnifier can be positioned will no longer be clipped, so the
         * magnifier will be able to extend outside the main application window boundaries (and also
         * overlap the system insets). This can be useful if you require a custom behavior, but it
         * should be handled with care, when passing coordinates to {@link #show(float, float)};
         * note that:
         * <ul>
         *   <li>in a multiwindow context, if the magnifier crosses the boundary between the two
         *   windows, it will not be able to show over the window of the other application</li>
         *   <li>if the magnifier overlaps the status bar, there is no guarantee about which one
         *   will be displayed on top. This should be handled with care.</li>
         * </ul>
         * @param clip whether the magnifier position will be adjusted
