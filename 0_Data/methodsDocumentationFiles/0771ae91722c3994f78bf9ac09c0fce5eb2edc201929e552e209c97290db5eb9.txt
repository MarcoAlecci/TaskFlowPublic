     * Force switch to the next input method and subtype. If there is no IME enabled except
     * current IME and subtype, do nothing.
     * @param imeToken Supplies the identifying token given to an input method when it was started,
     * which allows it to perform this operation on itself.
     * @param onlyCurrentIme if true, the framework will find the next subtype which
     * belongs to the current IME
     * @return true if the current input method and subtype was successfully switched to the next
     * input method and subtype.
     * @deprecated Use {@link InputMethodService#switchToNextInputMethod(boolean)} instead. This
     * method was intended for IME developers who should be accessing APIs through the service.
     * APIs in this class are intended for app developers interacting with the IME.
