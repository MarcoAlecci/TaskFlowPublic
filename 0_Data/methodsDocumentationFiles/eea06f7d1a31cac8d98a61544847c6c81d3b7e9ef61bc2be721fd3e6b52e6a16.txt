     * Indicates to the receiver of the {@link ParcelableCall} whether a change has occurred in the
     * {@link android.telecom.InCallService.VideoCall} associated with this call.  Since
     * {@link #getVideoCall()} creates a new {@link VideoCallImpl}, it is useful to know whether
     * the provider has changed (which can influence whether it is accessed).
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the video call changed, {@code false} otherwise.
