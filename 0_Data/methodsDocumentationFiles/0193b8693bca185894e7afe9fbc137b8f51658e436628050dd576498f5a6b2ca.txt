     * Override this to handle requests to perform a batch of operations, or the
     * default implementation will iterate over the operations and call
     * {@link ContentProviderOperation#apply} on each of them.
     * If all calls to {@link ContentProviderOperation#apply} succeed
     * then a {@link ContentProviderResult} array with as many
     * elements as there were operations will be returned.  If any of the calls
     * fail, it is up to the implementation how many of the others take effect.
     * This method can be called from multiple threads, as described in
     * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     *
     * @param operations the operations to apply
     * @return the results of the applications
     * @throws OperationApplicationException thrown if any operation fails.
