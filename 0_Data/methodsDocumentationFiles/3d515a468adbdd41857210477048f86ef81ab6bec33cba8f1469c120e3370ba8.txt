     * Returns whether the overlay is enabled by default.
     * Overlays that are not configured are disabled by default.
     *
     * If an immutable overlay has its enabled state change, the new enabled state is applied to the
     * overlay.
     *
     * When a mutable is first seen by the OverlayManagerService, the default-enabled state will be
     * applied to the overlay. If the configured default-enabled state changes in a subsequent boot,
     * the default-enabled state will not be applied to the overlay.
     *
     * The configured enabled state will only be applied when:
     * <ul>
     * <li> The device is factory reset
     * <li> The overlay is removed from the device and added back to the device in a future OTA
     * <li> The overlay changes its package name
     * <li> The overlay changes its target package name or target overlayable name
     * <li> An immutable overlay becomes mutable
     * </ul>
