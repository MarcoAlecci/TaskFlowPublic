     * Implement this to handle requests to delete one or more rows. The
     * implementation should apply the selection clause when performing
     * deletion, allowing the operation to affect multiple rows in a directory.
     * As a courtesy, call
     * {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(android.net.Uri ,android.database.ContentObserver)
     * notifyChange()} after deleting. This method can be called from multiple
     * threads, as described in <a href="
     * {@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">Processes
     * and Threads</a>.
     * <p>
     * The implementation is responsible for parsing out a row ID at the end of
     * the URI, if a specific row is being deleted. That is, the client would
     * pass in <code>content://contacts/people/22</code> and the implementation
     * is responsible for parsing the record number (22) when creating a SQL
     * statement.
     *
     * @param uri The full URI to query, including a row ID (if a specific
     *            record is requested).
     * @param selection An optional restriction to apply to rows when deleting.
     * @return The number of rows affected.
     * @throws SQLException
