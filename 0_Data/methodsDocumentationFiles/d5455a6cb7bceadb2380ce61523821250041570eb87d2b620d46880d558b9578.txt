     * Notify the host application that a page has finished loading. This method
     * is called only for main frame. Receiving an {@code onPageFinished()} callback does not
     * guarantee that the next frame drawn by WebView will reflect the state of the DOM at this
     * point. In order to be notified that the current DOM state is ready to be rendered, request a
     * visual state callback with {@link WebView#postVisualStateCallback} and wait for the supplied
     * callback to be triggered.
     *
     * @param view The WebView that is initiating the callback.
     * @param url The url of the page.
