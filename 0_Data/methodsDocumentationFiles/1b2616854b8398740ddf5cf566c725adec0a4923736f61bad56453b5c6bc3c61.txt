     * Returns a {@code BigInteger} whose value is {@code this >> n}. For
     * negative arguments, the result is also negative. The shift distance may
     * be negative which means that {@code this} is shifted left.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Note:</b> Usage of this method on negative values is
     * not recommended as the current implementation is not efficient.
     *
     * @param n shift distance
     * @return {@code this >> n} if {@code n >= 0}; {@code this << (-n)}
     *     otherwise
