     * NOTE: The MAC address returned here should only be used for inventory management and is
     * not likely to be the MAC address used by the device to connect to Wi-Fi networks: MAC
     * addresses used for scanning and connecting to Wi-Fi networks are randomized by default.
     * To get the randomized MAC address used, call

     * @param admin Which device owner this request is associated with.
     * @return the MAC address of the Wi-Fi device, or null when the information is not available.
     *         (For example, Wi-Fi hasn't been enabled, or the device doesn't support Wi-Fi.)
     *         <p>
     *         The address will be in the {@code XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX} format.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device owner.
