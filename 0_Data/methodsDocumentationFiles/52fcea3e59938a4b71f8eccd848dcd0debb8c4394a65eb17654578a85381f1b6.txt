     * This method is used to inject raw sensor data into the HAL.  Call {@link
     * initDataInjection(boolean)} before this method to set the HAL in data injection mode. This
     * method should be called only if a previous call to initDataInjection has been successful and
     * the HAL and SensorService are already opreating in data injection mode.
     *
     * @param sensor The sensor to inject.
     * @param values Sensor values to inject. The length of this
     *               array must be exactly equal to the number of
     *               values reported by the sensor type.
     * @param accuracy Accuracy of the sensor.
     * @param timestamp Sensor timestamp associated with the event.
     *
     * @return boolean True if the data injection succeeds, false
     *         otherwise.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException when the sensor is null,
     *         data injection is not supported by the sensor, values
     *         are null, incorrect number of values for the sensor,
     *         sensor accuracy is incorrect or timestamps are
     *         invalid.
