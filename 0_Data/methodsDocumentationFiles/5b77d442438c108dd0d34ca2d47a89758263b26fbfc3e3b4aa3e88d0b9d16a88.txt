     * <p>Performs the chromatic adaptation of a color space from its native
     * white point to the specified white point. If the specified color space
     * does not have an {@link Model#RGB RGB} color model, or if the color
     * space already has the target white point, the color space is returned
     * unmodified.</p>
     *
     * <p>The chromatic adaptation is performed using the von Kries method
     * described in the documentation of {@link Adaptation}.</p>
     *
     * <p class="note">The color space returned by this method always has
     * an ID of {@link #MIN_ID}.</p>
     *
     * @param colorSpace The color space to chromatically adapt
     * @param whitePoint The new white point
     * @param adaptation The adaptation matrix
     * @return A new color space if the specified color space has an RGB
     *         model and a white point different from the specified white
     *         point; the specified color space otherwise
