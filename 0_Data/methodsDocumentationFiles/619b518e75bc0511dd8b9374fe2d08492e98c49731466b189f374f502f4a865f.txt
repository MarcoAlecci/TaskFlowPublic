         * This method is called when some results from an image capture are
         * available.
         *
         * <p>The result provided here will contain some subset of the fields of
         * a full result. Multiple onCapturePartial calls may happen per
         * capture; a given result field will only be present in one partial
         * capture at most. The final onCaptureCompleted call will always
         * contain all the fields, whether onCapturePartial was called or
         * not.</p>
         *
         * <p>The default implementation of this method does nothing.</p>
         *

         * @param result The partial output metadata from the capture, which
         * includes a subset of the CaptureResult fields.
