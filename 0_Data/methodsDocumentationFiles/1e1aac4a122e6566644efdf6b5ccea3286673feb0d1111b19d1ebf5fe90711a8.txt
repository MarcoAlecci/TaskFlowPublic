     * Changes the transformation matrix on the view. This is used in animation frameworks,
     * such as {@link android.transition.Transition}. When the animation finishes, the matrix
     * should be cleared by calling this method with <code>null</code> as the matrix parameter.
     * Application developers should use transformation methods like {@link #setRotation(float)},
     * {@link #setScaleX(float)}, {@link #setScaleX(float)}, {@link #setTranslationX(float)}}
     * and {@link #setTranslationY(float)} (float)}} instead.
     *
     * @param matrix The matrix, null indicates that the matrix should be cleared.
