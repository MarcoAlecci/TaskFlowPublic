     * Returns carrier id of the current subscription.
     * <p>To recognize a carrier (including MVNO) as a first-class identity, Android assigns each
     * carrier with a canonical integer a.k.a. carrier id. The carrier ID is an Android
     * platform-wide identifier for a carrier. AOSP maintains carrier ID assignments in
     * <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/providers/TelephonyProvider/+/master/assets/latest_carrier_id/carrier_list.textpb">here</a>
     *
     * <p>Apps which have carrier-specific configurations or business logic can use the carrier id
     * as an Android platform-wide identifier for carriers.
     *
     * @return Carrier id of the current subscription. Return {@link #UNKNOWN_CARRIER_ID} if the
     * subscription is unavailable or the carrier cannot be identified.
