     * Wraps a character sequence into a buffer.
     *
     * <p> The content of the new, read-only buffer will be the content of the
     * given character sequence.  The buffer's capacity will be
     * <tt>csq.length()</tt>, its position will be <tt>start</tt>, its limit
     * will be <tt>end</tt>, and its mark will be undefined.  </p>
     *
     * @param  csq
     *         The character sequence from which the new character buffer is to
     *         be created
     *
     * @param  start
     *         The index of the first character to be used;
     *         must be non-negative and no larger than <tt>csq.length()</tt>.
     *         The new buffer's position will be set to this value.
     *
     * @param  end
     *         The index of the character following the last character to be
     *         used; must be no smaller than <tt>start</tt> and no larger
     *         than <tt>csq.length()</tt>.
     *         The new buffer's limit will be set to this value.

     *          If the preconditions on the <tt>start</tt> and <tt>end</tt>
     *          parameters do not hold
