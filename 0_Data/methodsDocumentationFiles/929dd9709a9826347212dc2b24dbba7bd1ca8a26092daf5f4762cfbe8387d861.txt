     * Performs a strict and comprehensive check of whether a calling package is allowed to
     * write/modify system settings, as the condition differs for pre-M, M+, and
     * privileged/preinstalled apps. If the provided uid does not match the
     * callingPackage, a negative result will be returned. The caller is expected to have
     * the WRITE_SETTINGS permission declared.
     *
     * Note: if the check is successful, the operation of this app will be updated to the
     * current time.
