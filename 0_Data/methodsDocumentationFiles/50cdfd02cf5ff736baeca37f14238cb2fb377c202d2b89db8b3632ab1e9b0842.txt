     * Called by the system when the device configuration changes while your
     * activity is running.  Note that this will <em>only</em> be called if
     * you have selected configurations you would like to handle with the
     * {@link android.R.attr#configChanges} attribute in your manifest.  If
     * any configuration change occurs that is not selected to be reported
     * by that attribute, then instead of reporting it the system will stop
     * and restart the activity (to have it launched with the new
     * configuration).
     *
     * <p>At the time that this function has been called, your Resources
     * object will have been updated to return resource values matching the
     * new configuration.
     *
     * @param newConfig The new device configuration.
