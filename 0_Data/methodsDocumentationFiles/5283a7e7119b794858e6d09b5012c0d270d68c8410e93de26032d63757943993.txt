     * Registers a new incoming conference. A {@link ConnectionService} should invoke this method
     * when it has an incoming conference. For managed {@link ConnectionService}s, the specified
     * {@link PhoneAccountHandle} must have been registered with {@link #registerPhoneAccount} and
     * the user must have enabled the corresponding {@link PhoneAccount}.  This can be checked using
     * {@link #getPhoneAccount}. Self-managed {@link ConnectionService}s must have
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#MANAGE_OWN_CALLS} to add a new incoming call.
     * <p>
     * The incoming conference you are adding is assumed to have a video state of
     * {@link VideoProfile#STATE_AUDIO_ONLY}, unless the extra value
     * {@link #EXTRA_INCOMING_VIDEO_STATE} is specified.
     * <p>
     * Once invoked, this method will cause the system to bind to the {@link ConnectionService}
     * associated with the {@link PhoneAccountHandle} and request additional information about the
     * call (See {@link ConnectionService#onCreateIncomingConference}) before starting the incoming
     * call UI.
     * <p>
     * For a managed {@link ConnectionService}, a {@link SecurityException} will be thrown if either
     * the {@link PhoneAccountHandle} does not correspond to a registered {@link PhoneAccount} or
     * the associated {@link PhoneAccount} is not currently enabled by the user.
     *
     * @param phoneAccount A {@link PhoneAccountHandle} registered with
     *            {@link #registerPhoneAccount}.
     * @param extras A bundle that will be passed through to
     *            {@link ConnectionService#onCreateIncomingConference}.
