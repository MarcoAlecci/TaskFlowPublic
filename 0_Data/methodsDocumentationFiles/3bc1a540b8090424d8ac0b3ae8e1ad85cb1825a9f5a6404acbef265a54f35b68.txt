     * new input and outputs if possible.
     *
     * <p>The configuration may gracefully fail, if input configuration is not supported,
     * if there are too many outputs, if the formats are not supported, or if the sizes for that
     * format is not supported. In this case this function will return {@code false} and the
     * unconfigured callback will be fired.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the configuration succeeds (with 1 or more outputs with or without an input),
     * then the idle callback is fired. Unconfiguring the device always fires the idle callback.</p>
