         * <p>Transforms the specified color from the source color space
         * to a color in the destination color space. This convenience
         * method assumes a source color model with 3 components
         * (typically RGB). To transform from color models with more than
         * 3 components, such as {@link Model#CMYK CMYK}, use
         * {@link #transform(float[])} instead.</p>
         *
         * @param r The red component of the color to transform
         * @param g The green component of the color to transform
         * @param b The blue component of the color to transform
         * @return A new array of 3 floats containing the specified color
         *         transformed from the source space to the destination space
