     * Cancel the current device discovery process.
     * <p>Because discovery is a heavyweight procedure for the Bluetooth
     * adapter, this method should always be called before attempting to connect
     * to a remote device with {@link
     * android.bluetooth.BluetoothSocket#connect()}. Discovery is not managed by
     * the  Activity, but is run as a system service, so an application should
     * always call cancel discovery even if it did not directly request a
     * discovery, just to be sure.
     * <p>If Bluetooth state is not {@link #STATE_ON}, this API
     * will return false. After turning on Bluetooth,
     * wait for {@link #ACTION_STATE_CHANGED} with {@link #STATE_ON}
     * to get the updated value.
     *
     * @return true on success, false on error
