     * Create and return a new {@link Tab}.
     * This tab will not be included in the action bar until it is added.
     *
     * <p>Very often tabs will be used to switch between {@link Fragment}
     * objects.  Here is a typical implementation of such tabs:</p>
     *
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentTabs.java
     *      complete}
     *
     * @return A new Tab
     *
     * @see #addTab(Tab)
     *
     * @deprecated Action bar navigation modes are deprecated and not supported by inline
     * toolbar action bars. Consider using other
     * <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html">common
     * navigation patterns</a> instead.
