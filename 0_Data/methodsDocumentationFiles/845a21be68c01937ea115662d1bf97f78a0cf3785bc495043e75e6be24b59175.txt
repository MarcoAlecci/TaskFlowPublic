     * Atomically conditionally sets the tag value for this task.
     * Among other applications, tags can be used as visit markers
     * in tasks operating on graphs, as in methods that check: {@code
     * if (task.compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag((short)0, (short)1))}
     * before processing, otherwise exiting because the node has
     * already been visited.
     *
     * @param expect the expected tag value
     * @param update the new tag value
     * @return {@code true} if successful; i.e., the current value was
     * equal to {@code expect} and was changed to {@code update}.
