     * The amount of time, in milliseconds, between each frame of the animation.
     * <p>
     * This is a requested time that the animation will attempt to honor, but the actual delay
     * between frames may be different, depending on system load and capabilities. This is a static
     * function because the same delay will be applied to all animations, since they are all
     * run off of a single timing loop.
     * </p><p>
     * The frame delay may be ignored when the animation system uses an external timing
     * source, such as the display refresh rate (vsync), to govern animations.
