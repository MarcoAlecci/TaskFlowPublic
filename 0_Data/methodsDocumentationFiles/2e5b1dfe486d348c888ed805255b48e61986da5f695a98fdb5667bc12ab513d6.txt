     * Return a {@link java.util.Set} for iterating over and interacting with all mappings
     * in the array map.
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> this is a very inefficient way to access the array contents, it
     * requires generating a number of temporary objects and allocates additional state
     * information associated with the container that will remain for the life of the container.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b></p> the semantics of this
     * Set are subtly different than that of a {@link java.util.HashMap}: most important,
     * the {@link java.util.Map.Entry Map.Entry} object returned by its iterator is a single
     * object that exists for the entire iterator, so you can <b>not</b> hold on to it
     * after calling {@link java.util.Iterator#next() Iterator.next}.</p>
