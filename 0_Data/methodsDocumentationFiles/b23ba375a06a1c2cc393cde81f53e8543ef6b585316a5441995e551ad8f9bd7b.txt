         * Sets the zoom to be applied to the chosen content before being copied to the magnifier.
         * A content of size (content_width, content_height) will be magnified to
         * (content_width * zoom, content_height * zoom), which will coincide with the size
         * of the magnifier. A zoom of 1 will translate to no magnification (the content will
         * be just copied to the magnifier with no scaling). The zoom defaults to 1.25.
         * Note that the zoom can also be changed after the instance is built, using the
         * {@link Magnifier#setZoom(float)} method.
         * @param zoom the zoom to be set
