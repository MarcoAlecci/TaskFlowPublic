     * Explicitly requests a new autofill context for virtual views.
     *
     * <p>Normally, the autofill context is automatically started if necessary when
     * {@link #notifyViewEntered(View, int, Rect)} is called, but this method should be used in the
     * cases where it must be explicitly started. For example, when the virtual view offers an
     * AUTOFILL option on its contextual overflow menu, and the user selects it.
     *
     * <p>The virtual view boundaries must be absolute screen coordinates. For example, if the
     * parent view uses {@code bounds} to draw the virtual view inside its Canvas,
     * the absolute bounds could be calculated by:
     *
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     *   int offset[] = new int[2];
     *   getLocationOnScreen(offset);
     *   Rect absBounds = new Rect(bounds.left + offset[0],
     *       bounds.top + offset[1],
     *       bounds.right + offset[0], bounds.bottom + offset[1]);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param view the virtual view parent.
     * @param virtualId id identifying the virtual child inside the parent view.
     * @param absBounds absolute boundaries of the virtual view in the screen.
