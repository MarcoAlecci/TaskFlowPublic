     * @param text the source text.
     * @param status an input-output parameter.  On input, the

     * occurred, status.index is set to the first unparsed character
     * in the source text.  On exit, if an error did occur,
     * status.index is unchanged and status.errorIndex is set to the
     * first index of the character that caused the parse to fail.
     * @return A Number representing the value of the number parsed.
