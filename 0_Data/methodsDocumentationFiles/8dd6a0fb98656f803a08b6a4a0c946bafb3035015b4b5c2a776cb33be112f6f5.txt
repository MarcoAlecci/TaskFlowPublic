     * Callback invoked when device call state changes.
     * <p>
     * Reports the state of Telephony (mobile) calls on the device for the registered subscription.
     * <p>
     * Note: the registration subId comes from {@link TelephonyManager} object which registers
     * PhoneStateListener by {@link TelephonyManager#listen(PhoneStateListener, int)}.
     * If this TelephonyManager object was created with
     * {@link TelephonyManager#createForSubscriptionId(int)}, then the callback applies to the
     * subId. Otherwise, this callback applies to
     * {@link SubscriptionManager#getDefaultSubscriptionId()}.
     * <p>
     * Note: The state returned here may differ from that returned by
     * {@link TelephonyManager#getCallState()}. Receivers of this callback should be aware that
     * calling {@link TelephonyManager#getCallState()} from within this callback may return a
     * different state than the callback reports.
     *
     * @param state call state
     * @param phoneNumber call phone number. If application does not have
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_CALL_LOG READ_CALL_LOG} permission or carrier
     * privileges (see {@link TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges}), an empty string will be
     * passed as an argument.
