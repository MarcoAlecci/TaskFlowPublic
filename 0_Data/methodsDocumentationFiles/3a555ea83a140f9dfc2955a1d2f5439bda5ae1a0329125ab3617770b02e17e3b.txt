         * @implSpec the default implementation invokes {@link #asPrimitiveArray()}
         * to obtain a double[] array then and copies the elements from that
         * double[] array into the boxed Double[] array.  This is not efficient
         * and it is recommended to invoke {@link #copyInto(Object, int)}.
