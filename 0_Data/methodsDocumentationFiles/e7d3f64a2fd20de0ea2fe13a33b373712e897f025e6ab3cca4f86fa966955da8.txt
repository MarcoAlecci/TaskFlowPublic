     * Request a network to satisfy a set of {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities}, limited
     * by a timeout.
     *
     * This method behaves identically to
     * {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback, int)} but runs all the callbacks
     * on the passed Handler.
     *
     * <p>This method has the same permission requirements as
     * {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)}, is subject to the same limitations,
     * and throws the same exceptions in the same conditions.
     *
     * @param request {@link NetworkRequest} describing this request.
     * @param networkCallback The {@link NetworkCallback} to be utilized for this request. Note
     *                        the callback must not be shared - it uniquely specifies this request.
     * @param handler {@link Handler} to specify the thread upon which the callback will be invoked.
     * @param timeoutMs The time in milliseconds to attempt looking for a suitable network
     *                  before {@link NetworkCallback#onUnavailable} is called.
