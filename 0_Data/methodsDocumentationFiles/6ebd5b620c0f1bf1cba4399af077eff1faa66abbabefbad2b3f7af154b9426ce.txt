     * Alternatively you may use the {@link #putExtras(Bundle)}, and
     * {@link #removeExtras(String...)} methods to modify the extras.
     * <p>
     * No assumptions should be made as to how an In-Call UI or service will handle these extras.
     * Keys should be fully qualified (e.g., com.example.MY_EXTRA) to avoid conflicts.
