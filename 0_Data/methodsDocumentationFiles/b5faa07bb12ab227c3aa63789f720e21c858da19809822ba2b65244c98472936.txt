     * Input methods are positioned at the bottom of the screen and, unless
     * running in fullscreen, will generally want to be as short as possible
     * so should compute their height based on their contents.  However, they
     * can stretch as much as needed horizontally.  The function returns to
     * you the maximum amount of space available horizontally, which you can
     * use if needed for UI placement.
     * 
     * <p>In many cases this is not needed, you can just rely on the normal
     * view layout mechanisms to position your views within the full horizontal
     * space given to the input method.
     * 
     * <p>Note that this value can change dynamically, in particular when the
     * screen orientation changes.
