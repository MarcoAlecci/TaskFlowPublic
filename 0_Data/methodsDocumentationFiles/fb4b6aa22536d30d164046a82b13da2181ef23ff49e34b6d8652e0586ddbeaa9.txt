     * Give the host application a chance to handle the key event synchronously.
     * e.g. menu shortcut key events need to be filtered this way. If return
     * true, WebView will not handle the key event. If return {@code false}, WebView
     * will always handle the key event, so none of the super in the view chain
     * will see the key event. The default behavior returns {@code false}.
     *
     * @param view The WebView that is initiating the callback.
     * @param event The key event.
     * @return {@code true} if the host application wants to handle the key event
     *         itself, otherwise return {@code false}
