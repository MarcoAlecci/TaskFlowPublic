         * Encodes all remaining bytes from the specified byte buffer into
         * a newly-allocated ByteBuffer using the {@link Base64} encoding
         * scheme.
         *
         * Upon return, the source buffer's position will be updated to
         * its limit; its limit will not have been changed. The returned
         * output buffer's position will be zero and its limit will be the
         * number of resulting encoded bytes.
         *
         * @param   buffer
         *          the source ByteBuffer to encode
         * @return  A newly-allocated byte buffer containing the encoded bytes.
