     * Save the tag data into the original image file. This is expensive because
     * it involves copying all the data from one file to another and deleting
     * the old file and renaming the other. It's best to use
     * {@link #setAttribute(String,String)} to set all attributes to write and
     * make a single call rather than multiple calls for each attribute.
     * <p>
     * This method is only supported for JPEG and PNG files.
     * <p class="note">
     * Note: after calling this method, any attempts to obtain range information
     * from {@link #getAttributeRange(String)} or {@link #getThumbnailRange()}
     * will throw {@link IllegalStateException}, since the offsets may have
     * changed in the newly written file.
