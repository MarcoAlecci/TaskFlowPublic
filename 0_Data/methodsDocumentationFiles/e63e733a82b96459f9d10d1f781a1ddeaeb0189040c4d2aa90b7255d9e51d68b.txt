     * Sets the session wide camera parameters (see {@link CaptureRequest}). This argument can
     * be set for every supported session type and will be passed to the camera device as part
     * of the capture session initialization. Session parameters are a subset of the available
     * capture request parameters (see {@link CameraCharacteristics#getAvailableSessionKeys})
     * and their application can introduce internal camera delays. To improve camera performance
     * it is suggested to change them sparingly within the lifetime of the capture session and
     * to pass their initial values as part of this method.
     *
     * @param params A capture request that includes the initial values for any available
     *               session wide capture keys. Tags (see {@link CaptureRequest.Builder#setTag}) and
     *               output targets (see {@link CaptureRequest.Builder#addTarget}) are ignored if
     *               set. Parameter values not part of
     *               {@link CameraCharacteristics#getAvailableSessionKeys} will also be ignored. It
     *               is recommended to build the session parameters using the same template type as
     *               the initial capture request, so that the session and initial request parameters
     *               match as much as possible.
