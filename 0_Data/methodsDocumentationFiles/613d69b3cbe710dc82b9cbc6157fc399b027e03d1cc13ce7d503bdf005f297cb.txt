     * Get the input Surface associated with a reprocessable capture session.
     *
     * <p>Each reprocessable capture session has an input {@link Surface} where the reprocess
     * capture requests get the input images from, rather than the camera device. The application
     * can create a {@link android.media.ImageWriter ImageWriter} with this input {@link Surface}
     * and use it to provide input images for reprocess capture requests. When the reprocessable
     * capture session is closed, the input {@link Surface} is abandoned and becomes invalid.</p>
     *
     * @return The {@link Surface} where reprocessing capture requests get the input images from. If
     *         this is not a reprocess capture session, {@code null} will be returned.
