     * Binds the {@code ServerSocket} to a specific address
     * (IP address and port number).
     * <p>
     * If the address is {@code null}, then the system will pick up
     * an ephemeral port and a valid local address to bind the socket.
     * <P>
     * The {@code backlog} argument is the requested maximum number of
     * pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation
     * specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length
     * or may choose to ignore the parameter altogther. The value provided
     * should be greater than {@code 0}. If it is less than or equal to
     * {@code 0}, then an implementation specific default will be used.
     * @param   endpoint        The IP address and port number to bind to.
     * @param   backlog         requested maximum length of the queue of
     *                          incoming connections.
     * @throws  IOException if the bind operation fails, or if the socket
     *                     is already bound.
     * @throws  SecurityException       if a {@code SecurityManager} is present and
     * its {@code checkListen} method doesn't allow the operation.
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException if endpoint is a
     *          SocketAddress subclass not supported by this socket
