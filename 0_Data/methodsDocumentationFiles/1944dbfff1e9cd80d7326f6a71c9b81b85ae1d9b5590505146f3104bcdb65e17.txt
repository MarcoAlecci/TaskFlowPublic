     * If <code>offset</code> is within a word, returns the index of the last character of that
     * word plus one, otherwise returns BreakIterator.DONE.
     *
     * The offsets that are considered to be part of a word are the indexes of its characters,
     * <i>as well as</i> the index of its last character plus one.
     * If offset is the index of a low surrogate character, BreakIterator.DONE will be returned.
     *
     * Valid range for offset is [0..textLength] (note the inclusive upper bound).
     * The returned value is within [offset..textLength] or BreakIterator.DONE.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException is offset is not valid.
