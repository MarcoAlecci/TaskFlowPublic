         * @implSpec the default implementation invokes {@link #asPrimitiveArray()} to
         * obtain an int[] array then and copies the elements from that int[]
         * array into the boxed Integer[] array.  This is not efficient and it
         * is recommended to invoke {@link #copyInto(Object, int)}.
