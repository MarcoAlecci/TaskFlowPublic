     * Used to reverse item traversal and layout order.
     * This behaves similar to the layout change for RTL views. When set to true, first item is
     * laid out at the end of the UI, second item is laid out before it etc.
     *
     * For horizontal layouts, it depends on the layout direction.
     * When set to true, If {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView} is LTR, than it will
     * layout from RTL, if {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView}} is RTL, it will layout
     * from LTR.
     *
     * If you are looking for the exact same behavior of
     * {@link android.widget.AbsListView#setStackFromBottom(boolean)}, use
     * {@link #setStackFromEnd(boolean)}
