             * Instead of specifying pixels to scroll, use the target position to jump using
             * {@link RecyclerView#scrollToPosition(int)}.
             * <p>
             * You may prefer using this method if scroll target is really far away and you prefer
             * to jump to a location and smooth scroll afterwards.
             * <p>
             * Note that calling this method takes priority over other update methods such as
             * {@link #update(int, int, int, Interpolator)}, {@link #setX(float)},
             * {@link #setY(float)} and #{@link #setInterpolator(Interpolator)}. If you call
             * {@link #jumpTo(int)}, the other changes will not be considered for this animation
             * frame.
             *
             * @param targetPosition The target item position to scroll to using instant scrolling.
