     * properties are re-read. Adding multiple instances of
     * the same event Listener results in multiple entries
     * in the property event listener table.

     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
     *             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
     * @exception NullPointerException if the PropertyChangeListener is null.
     * @deprecated The dependency on {@code PropertyChangeListener} creates a
     *             significant impediment to future modularization of the Java
     *             platform. This method will be removed in a future release.
     *             The global {@code LogManager} can detect changes to the
     *             logging configuration by overridding the {@link
     *             #readConfiguration readConfiguration} method.
