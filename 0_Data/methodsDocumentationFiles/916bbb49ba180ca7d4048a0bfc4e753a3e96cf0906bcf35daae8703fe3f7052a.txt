     * This provides direct access to all of the files included in an application
     * package (not only its assets).  Applications should not normally use this.
     *
     * The asset must not be compressed, or an exception will be thrown.
     *
     * @param cookie Identifier of the package to be opened.
     * @param fileName Name of the asset to retrieve.
