     * Removes an existing MmTel {@link CapabilityCallback}.
     *
     * When the subscription associated with this callback is removed (SIM removed, ESIM swap,
     * etc...), this callback will automatically be removed. If this method is called for an
     * inactive subscription, it will result in a no-op.
     * <p>This API requires one of the following:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>The caller holds the READ_PRECISE_PHONE_STATE permission.</li>
     *     <li>If the caller is the device or profile owner, the caller holds the
     *     {@link Manifest.permission#READ_PRECISE_PHONE_STATE} permission.</li>
     *     <li>The caller has carrier privileges (see
     *     {@link android.telephony.TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges}) on any
     *     active subscription.</li>
     *     <li>The caller is the default SMS app for the device.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>The profile owner is an app that owns a managed profile on the device; for more details
     * see <a href="https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles">Work profiles</a>.
     * Access by profile owners is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
