     * Set the preferred connection PHY for this app. Please note that this is just a
     * recommendation, whether the PHY change will happen depends on other applications peferences,
     * local and remote controller capabilities. Controller can override these settings. <p> {@link
     * BluetoothGattServerCallback#onPhyUpdate} will be triggered as a result of this call, even if
     * no PHY change happens. It is also triggered when remote device updates the PHY.
