     * Normalize a MIME data type.
     *
     * <p>A normalized MIME type has white-space trimmed,
     * content-type parameters removed, and is lower-case.
     * This aligns the type with Android best practices for
     * intent filtering.
     *
     * <p>For example, "text/plain; charset=utf-8" becomes "text/plain".
     * "text/x-vCard" becomes "text/x-vcard".
     *
     * <p>All MIME types received from outside Android (such as user input,
     * or external sources like Bluetooth, NFC, or the Internet) should
     * be normalized before they are used to create an Intent.
     *
     * @param type MIME data type to normalize
     * @return normalized MIME data type, or null if the input was null
