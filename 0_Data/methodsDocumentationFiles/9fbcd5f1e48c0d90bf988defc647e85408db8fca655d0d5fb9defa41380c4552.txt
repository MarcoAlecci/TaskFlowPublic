         * or not this one grants it the provided capability, represented by the {@code flags}
         * parameter.  In the event of signing certificate rotation, a package may still interact
         * with entities signed by its old signing certificate and not want to break previously
         * functioning behavior.  The {@code flags} value determines which capabilities the app
         * signed by the newer signing certificate would like to continue to give to its previous
         * signing certificate(s).

         * @param sha256String A hex-encoded representation of a sha256 digest.  In the case of an
