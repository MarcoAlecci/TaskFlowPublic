     * Obtains an instance defining a transition between two offsets.
     * <p>
     * Applications should normally obtain an instance from {@link ZoneRules}.
     * This factory is only intended for use when creating {@link ZoneRules}.
     *
     * @param transition  the transition date-time at the transition, which never
     *  actually occurs, expressed local to the before offset, not null
     * @param offsetBefore  the offset before the transition, not null
     * @param offsetAfter  the offset at and after the transition, not null
     * @return the transition, not null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code offsetBefore} and {@code offsetAfter}
     *         are equal, or {@code transition.getNano()} returns non-zero value
