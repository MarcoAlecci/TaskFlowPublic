     * may be null in which case the installed security providers will
     * be searched for the highest priority implementation of the

     * <P>
     * Only the first instance of a particular key and/or trust manager
     * implementation type in the array is used.  (For example, only
     * the first javax.net.ssl.X509KeyManager in the array will be used.)
