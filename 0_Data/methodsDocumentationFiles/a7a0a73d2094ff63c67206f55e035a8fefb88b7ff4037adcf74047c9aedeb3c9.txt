     * Sets up this AnimatorSet to play all of the supplied animations at the same time.
     * This is equivalent to calling {@link #play(Animator)} with the first animator in the
     * set and then {@link Builder#with(Animator)} with each of the other animators. Note that
     * an Animator with a {@link Animator#setStartDelay(long) startDelay} will not actually
     * start until that delay elapses, which means that if the first animator in the list
     * supplied to this constructor has a startDelay, none of the other animators will start
     * until that first animator's startDelay has elapsed.
     *
     * @param items The animations that will be started simultaneously.
