     * Processes a given {@link DrmInfoRequest} and returns the rights information asynchronously.
     *<p>
     * This is a utility method that consists of an
     * {@link #acquireDrmInfo(DrmInfoRequest) acquireDrmInfo()} and a
     * {@link #processDrmInfo(DrmInfo) processDrmInfo()} method call. This utility method can be 
     * used only if the selected DRM plug-in (agent) supports this sequence of calls. Some DRM
     * agents, such as OMA, do not support this utility method, in which case an application must
     * invoke {@link #acquireDrmInfo(DrmInfoRequest) acquireDrmInfo()} and
     * {@link #processDrmInfo(DrmInfo) processDrmInfo()} separately.
     *
     * @param drmInfoRequest The {@link DrmInfoRequest} used to acquire the rights.
     * @return ERROR_NONE for success; ERROR_UNKNOWN for failure.
