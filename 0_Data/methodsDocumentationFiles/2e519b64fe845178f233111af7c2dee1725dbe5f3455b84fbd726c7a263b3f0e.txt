     * Optional method which can be overridden by concrete implementations of NetworkSpecifier to
     * perform any redaction of information from the NetworkSpecifier, e.g. if it contains
     * sensitive information. The default implementation simply returns the object itself - i.e.
     * no information is redacted. A concrete implementation may return a modified (copy) of the
     * NetworkSpecifier, or even return a null to fully remove all information.
     * <p>
     * This method is relevant to NetworkSpecifier objects used by agents - those are shared with
     * apps by default. Some agents may store sensitive matching information in the specifier,
     * e.g. a Wi-Fi SSID (which should not be shared since it may leak location). Those classes
     * can redact to a null. Other agents use the Network Specifier to share public information
     * with apps - those should not be redacted.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation redacts no information.
     *
     * @return A NetworkSpecifier object to be passed along to the requesting app.
