         * Adds a frame commit callback. This callback will be invoked when the current rendering
         * content has been rendered into a frame and submitted to the swap chain. The frame may
         * not currently be visible on the display when this is invoked, but it has been submitted.
         * This callback is useful in combination with {@link PixelCopy} to capture the current
         * rendered content of the UI reliably.
         *
         * @param executor The executor to run the callback on. It is strongly recommended that
         *                 this executor post to a different thread, as the calling thread is
         *                 highly sensitive to being blocked.
         * @param frameCommitCallback The callback to invoke when the frame content has been drawn.
         *                            Will be invoked on the given {@link Executor}.
         *
         * @return this instance
