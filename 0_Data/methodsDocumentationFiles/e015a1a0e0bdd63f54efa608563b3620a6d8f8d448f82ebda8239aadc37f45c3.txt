     * specific user.
     *
     * @param intent The desired intent as per resolveActivity().
     * @param flags Additional option flags to modify the data returned. The
     *            most important is {@link #MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY}, to limit the
     *            resolution to only those activities that support the
     *            {@link android.content.Intent#CATEGORY_DEFAULT}. Or, set
     *            {@link #MATCH_ALL} to prevent any filtering of the results.
     * @param user The user being queried.
     * @return Returns a List of ResolveInfo objects containing one entry for
     *         each matching activity, ordered from best to worst. In other
     *         words, the first item is what would be returned by
     *         {@link #resolveActivity}. If there are no matching activities, an
     *         empty list is returned.
