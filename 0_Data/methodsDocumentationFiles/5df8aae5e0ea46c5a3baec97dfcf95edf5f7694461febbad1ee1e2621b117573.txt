     * Returns a randomly generated MAC address using the given Random object and the same
     * OUI values as the given MacAddress.
     *
     * The locally assigned bit is always set to 1. The multicast bit is always set to 0.
     *
     * @param base a base MacAddress whose OUI is used for generating the random address.
     *             If base == null then the OUI will also be randomized.
     * @param r a standard Java Random object used for generating the random address.
     * @return a random locally assigned MacAddress.
