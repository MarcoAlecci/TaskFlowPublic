     * Called when the instrumentation is starting, before any application code
     * has been loaded.  Usually this will be implemented to simply call
     * {@link #start} to begin the instrumentation thread, which will then
     * continue execution in {@link #onStart}.
     * 
     * <p>If you do not need your own thread -- that is you are writing your
     * instrumentation to be completely asynchronous (returning to the event
     * loop so that the application can run), you can simply begin your
     * instrumentation here, for example call {@link Context#startActivity} to
     * begin the appropriate first activity of the application. 
     *  
     * @param arguments Any additional arguments that were supplied when the 
     *                  instrumentation was started.
