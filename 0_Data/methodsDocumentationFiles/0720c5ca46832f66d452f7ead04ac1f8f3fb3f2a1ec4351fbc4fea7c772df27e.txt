     * Retrieve a set of activities that should be presented to the user as
     * similar options. This is like {@link #queryIntentActivities}, except it
     * also allows you to supply a list of more explicit Intents that you would
     * like to resolve to particular options, and takes care of returning the
     * final ResolveInfo list in a reasonable order, with no duplicates, based
     * on those inputs.
     *
     * @param caller The class name of the activity that is making the request.
     *            This activity will never appear in the output list. Can be
     *            null.
     * @param specifics An array of Intents that should be resolved to the first
     *            specific results. Can be null.
     * @param intent The desired intent as per resolveActivity().
     * @param flags Additional option flags to modify the data returned. The
     *            most important is {@link #MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY}, to limit the
     *            resolution to only those activities that support the
     *            {@link android.content.Intent#CATEGORY_DEFAULT}.
     * @return Returns a List of ResolveInfo objects containing one entry for
     *         each matching activity. The list is ordered first by all of the
     *         intents resolved in <var>specifics</var> and then any additional
     *         activities that can handle <var>intent</var> but did not get
     *         included by one of the <var>specifics</var> intents. If there are
     *         no matching activities, an empty list is returned.
