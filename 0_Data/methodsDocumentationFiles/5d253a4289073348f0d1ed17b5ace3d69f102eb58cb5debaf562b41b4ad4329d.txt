     * Temporarily override the billing relationship plan between a carrier and
     * a specific subscriber to be considered congested. This will cause the
     * device to delay certain network requests when possible, such as developer
     * jobs that are willing to run in a flexible time window.
     * <p>
     * This method is only accessible to the following narrow set of apps:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The carrier app for this subscriberId, as determined by
     * {@link TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges()}.
     * <li>The carrier app explicitly delegated access through
     * {@link CarrierConfigManager#KEY_CONFIG_PLANS_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_STRING}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param subId the subscriber this override applies to.
     * @param overrideCongested set if the subscription should be considered
     *            congested.
     * @param timeoutMillis the timeout after which the requested override will
     *            be automatically cleared, or {@code 0} to leave in the
     *            requested state until explicitly cleared, or the next reboot,
     *            whichever happens first.
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller doesn't meet the requirements
     *             outlined above.
