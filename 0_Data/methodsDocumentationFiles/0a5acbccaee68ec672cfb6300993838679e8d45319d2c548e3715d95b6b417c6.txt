     * Gets a string representation of the adapter data that can help
     * {@link android.service.autofill.AutofillService} autofill the view backed by the adapter.

     * <p>
     * It should only be set (i.e., non-{@code null} if the values do not represent PII
     * (Personally Identifiable Information - sensitive data such as email addresses,
     * credit card numbers, passwords, etc...). For
     * example, it's ok to return a list of month names, but not a list of usernames. A good rule of
     * thumb is that if the adapter data comes from static resources, such data is not PII - see
     * {@link android.view.ViewStructure#setDataIsSensitive(boolean)} for more info.
     *
     * @return {@code null} by default, unless implementations override it.
