     * Write a compressed version of the bitmap to the specified outputstream.
     * If this returns true, the bitmap can be reconstructed by passing a
     * corresponding inputstream to BitmapFactory.decodeStream(). Note: not
     * all Formats support all bitmap configs directly, so it is possible that
     * the returned bitmap from BitmapFactory could be in a different bitdepth,
     * and/or may have lost per-pixel alpha (e.g. JPEG only supports opaque
     * pixels).
     *
     * @param format   The format of the compressed image
     * @param quality  Hint to the compressor, 0-100. The value is interpreted
     *                 differently depending on the {@link CompressFormat}.
     * @param stream   The outputstream to write the compressed data.
     * @return true if successfully compressed to the specified stream.
