     * extracted text view, when running in fullscreen mode.  The default
     * implementation sends this action to the current InputConnection's
     * {@link InputConnection#performContextMenuAction(int)}, for it
     * to be processed in underlying "real" editor.  Re-implement this to
     * provide whatever behavior you want.
