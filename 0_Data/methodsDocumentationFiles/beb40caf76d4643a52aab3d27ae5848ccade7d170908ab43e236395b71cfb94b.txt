     * Returns the unit in the last place (ULP) of this {@code BigDecimal}
     * instance. An ULP is the distance to the nearest big decimal with the same
     * precision.
     *
     * <p>The amount of a rounding error in the evaluation of a floating-point
     * operation is often expressed in ULPs. An error of 1 ULP is often seen as
     * a tolerable error.
     *
     * <p>For class {@code BigDecimal}, the ULP of a number is simply 10<sup>-scale</sup>.
     * For example, {@code new BigDecimal(0.1).ulp()} returns {@code 1E-55}.
