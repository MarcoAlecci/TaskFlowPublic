     * Called by an application that is administering the device to set the password restrictions it
     * is imposing. After setting this, the user will not be able to enter a new password that is
     * not at least as restrictive as what has been set. Note that the current password will remain
     * until the user has set a new one, so the change does not take place immediately. To prompt
     * the user for a new password, use {@link #ACTION_SET_NEW_PASSWORD} or
     * {@link #ACTION_SET_NEW_PARENT_PROFILE_PASSWORD} after calling this method.
     * <p>
     * Quality constants are ordered so that higher values are more restrictive; thus the highest
     * requested quality constant (between the policy set here, the user's preference, and any other
     * considerations) is the one that is in effect.
     * <p>
     * On devices not supporting {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_SECURE_LOCK_SCREEN} feature, the
     * password is always treated as empty.
     * <p>
     * The calling device admin must have requested
     * {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_LIMIT_PASSWORD} to be able to call this method; if it has
     * not, a security exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to set restrictions on the parent
     * profile.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param quality The new desired quality. One of {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED},
     *            {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_BIOMETRIC_WEAK},
     *            {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_SOMETHING}, {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_NUMERIC},
     *            {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_NUMERIC_COMPLEX}, {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_ALPHABETIC},
     *            {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_ALPHANUMERIC} or {@link #PASSWORD_QUALITY_COMPLEX}.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not an active administrator or if {@code admin}
     *             does not use {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_LIMIT_PASSWORD}
