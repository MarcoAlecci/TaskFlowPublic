     * Returns an ApexEnvironment instance for the APEX with the provided {@code apexModuleName}.
     *
     * <p>To preserve the safety and integrity of APEX modules, you must only obtain the
     * ApexEnvironment for your specific APEX, and you <em>must never</em> attempt to obtain an
     * ApexEnvironment for another APEX.  Any coordination between APEXs must be performed through
     * well-defined interfaces; attempting to directly read or write raw files belonging to another
     * APEX will violate the hermetic storage requirements placed upon each module.
