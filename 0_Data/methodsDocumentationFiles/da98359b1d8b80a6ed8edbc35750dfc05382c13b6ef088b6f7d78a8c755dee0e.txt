     * <p>This API is asynchronous and {@link #ACTION_UUID} intent is sent,
     * with the UUIDs supported by the remote end. If there is an error
     * in getting the SDP records or if the process takes a long time,
     * {@link #ACTION_UUID} intent is sent with the UUIDs that is currently
     * present in the cache. Clients should use the {@link #getUuids} to get UUIDs
     * if service discovery is not to be performed.
     *
     * @return False if the sanity check fails, True if the process of initiating an ACL connection
     * to the remote device was started.
