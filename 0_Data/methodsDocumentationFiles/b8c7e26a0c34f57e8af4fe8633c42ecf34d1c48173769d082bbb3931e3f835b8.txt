     * Create an Inet6Address in the exact manner of {@link
     * InetAddress#getByAddress(String,byte[])} except that the IPv6 scope_id is
     * set to the value corresponding to the given interface for the address
     * type specified in {@code addr}. The call will fail with an
     * UnknownHostException if the given interface does not have a numeric
     * scope_id assigned for the given address type (eg. link-local or site-local).
     * See <a href="Inet6Address.html#scoped">here</a> for a description of IPv6
     * scoped addresses.
     *
     * @param host the specified host
     * @param addr the raw IP address in network byte order
     * @param nif an interface this address must be associated with.
     * @return  an Inet6Address object created from the raw IP address.
     * @throws  UnknownHostException
     *          if IP address is of illegal length, or if the interface does not
     *          have a numeric scope_id assigned for the given address type.
