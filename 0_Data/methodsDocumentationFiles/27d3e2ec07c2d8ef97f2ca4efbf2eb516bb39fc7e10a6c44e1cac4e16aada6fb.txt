     * Returns the absolute path to the directory on the filesystem similar to
     * {@link #getFilesDir()}. The difference is that files placed under this
     * directory will be excluded from automatic backup to remote storage. See
     * {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent BackupAgent} for a full discussion
     * of the automatic backup mechanism in Android.
     * <p>
     * The returned path may change over time if the calling app is moved to an
     * adopted storage device, so only relative paths should be persisted.
     * <p>
     * No additional permissions are required for the calling app to read or
     * write files under the returned path.
     *
     * @return The path of the directory holding application files that will not
     *         be automatically backed up to remote storage.
