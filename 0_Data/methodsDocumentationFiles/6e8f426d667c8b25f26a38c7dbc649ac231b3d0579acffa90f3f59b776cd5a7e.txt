         * Sets the total size (in bytes) of the buffer where audio data is written
         * during the recording. New audio data can be read from this buffer in smaller chunks
         * than this size. See {@link #getMinBufferSize(int, int, int)} to determine the minimum
         * required buffer size for the successful creation of an AudioRecord instance.
         * Since bufferSizeInBytes may be internally increased to accommodate the source
         * requirements, use {@link #getBufferSizeInFrames()} to determine the actual buffer size
         * in frames.
         * @param bufferSizeInBytes a value strictly greater than 0
         * @return the same Builder instance.
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException
