         * The Recycler may reuse a scrap or detached view from a shared pool if one is
         * available for the correct view type. If the adapter has not indicated that the
         * data at the given position has changed, the Recycler will attempt to hand back
         * a scrap view that was previously initialized for that data without rebinding.
