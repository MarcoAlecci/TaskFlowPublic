     * Checks whether or not {@code klass} is one of the metadata-primitive classes.
     *
     * <p>The following types (whether boxed or unboxed) are considered primitive:
     * <ul>
     * <li>byte
     * <li>int
     * <li>float
     * <li>double
     * <li>Rational
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>This doesn't strictly follow the java understanding of primitive since
     * boxed objects are included, Rational is included, and other types such as char and
     * short are not included.</p>
     *
     * @param klass a {@link Class} instance; using {@code null} will return {@code false}
     * @return {@code true} if primitive, {@code false} otherwise
