         * Allocates data in the buffer, and stores that key in the mapping for this
         * table.
         *
         * @param id    The id of the item (will be used in making the key)
         * @param count The number of bytes to allocate.  Must be less than
         *              SparseMappingTable.ARRAY_SIZE.
         *
         * @return The 'key' for this data value, which contains both the id itself
         *         and the location in the long arrays that the data is actually stored
         *         but should be considered opaque to the caller.
