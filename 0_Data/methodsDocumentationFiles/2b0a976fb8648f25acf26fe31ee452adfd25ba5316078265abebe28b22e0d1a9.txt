     * Remove this service from foreground state, allowing it to be killed if
     * more memory is needed.  This does not stop the service from running (for that
     * you use {@link #stopSelf()} or related methods), just takes it out of the
     * foreground state.
     *
     * @param flags additional behavior options.
