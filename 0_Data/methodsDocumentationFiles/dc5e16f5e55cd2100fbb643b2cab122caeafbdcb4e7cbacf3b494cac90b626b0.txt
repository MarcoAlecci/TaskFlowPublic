     * <p>Compute the vertical extent of the vertical scrollbar's thumb within the vertical range.
     * This value is used to compute the length of the thumb within the scrollbar's track.</p>
     *
     * <p>The range is expressed in arbitrary units that must be the same as the units used by
     * {@link #computeVerticalScrollRange()} and {@link #computeVerticalScrollOffset()}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Default implementation returns 0.</p>
     *
     * <p>If you want to support scroll bars, override
     * {@link RecyclerView.LayoutManager#computeVerticalScrollExtent(RecyclerView.State)} in your
     * LayoutManager.</p>
     *
     * @return The vertical extent of the scrollbar's thumb
