     * Retrieve a video frame near a given timestamp scaled to a desired size.
     * Call this method after setDataSource(). This method finds a representative
     * frame close to the given time position by considering the given option
     * if possible, and returns it as a bitmap with same aspect ratio as the source
     * while scaling it so that it fits into the desired size of dst_width by dst_height.
     * This is useful for generating a thumbnail for an input data source or just to
     * obtain a scaled frame at the given time position.
     *
     * @param timeUs The time position in microseconds where the frame will be retrieved.
     * When retrieving the frame at the given time position, there is no
     * guarantee that the data source has a frame located at the position.
     * When this happens, a frame nearby will be returned. If timeUs is
     * negative, time position and option will ignored, and any frame
     * that the implementation considers as representative may be returned.
     *
     * @param option a hint on how the frame is found. Use
     * {@link #OPTION_PREVIOUS_SYNC} if one wants to retrieve a sync frame
     * that has a timestamp earlier than or the same as timeUs. Use
     * {@link #OPTION_NEXT_SYNC} if one wants to retrieve a sync frame
     * that has a timestamp later than or the same as timeUs. Use
     * {@link #OPTION_CLOSEST_SYNC} if one wants to retrieve a sync frame
     * that has a timestamp closest to or the same as timeUs. Use
     * {@link #OPTION_CLOSEST} if one wants to retrieve a frame that may
     * or may not be a sync frame but is closest to or the same as timeUs.
     * {@link #OPTION_CLOSEST} often has larger performance overhead compared
     * to the other options if there is no sync frame located at timeUs.
     *
     * @param dstWidth expected output bitmap width
     * @param dstHeight expected output bitmap height
     * @param params BitmapParams that controls the returned bitmap config
     *        (such as pixel formats).
     *
     * @return A Bitmap of size not larger than dstWidth by dstHeight containing a
     *         scaled video frame, which can be null, if such a frame cannot be retrieved.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if passed in invalid option or width by height
     *         is less than or equal to 0.
