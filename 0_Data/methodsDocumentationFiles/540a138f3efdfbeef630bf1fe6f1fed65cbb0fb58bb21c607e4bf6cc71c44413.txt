     * Returns whether this looper's thread is currently polling for more work to do.
     * This is a good signal that the loop is still alive rather than being stuck
     * handling a callback.  Note that this method is intrinsically racy, since the
     * state of the loop can change before you get the result back.
     *
     * <p>This method is safe to call from any thread.
     *
     * @return True if the looper is currently polling for events.
     * @hide
