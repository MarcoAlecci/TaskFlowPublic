     * Set a proximity alert for the location given by the position
     * (latitude, longitude) and the given radius.
     *
     * <p> When the device
     * detects that it has entered or exited the area surrounding the
     * location, the given PendingIntent will be used to create an Intent
     * to be fired.
     *
     * <p> The fired Intent will have a boolean extra added with key
     * {@link #KEY_PROXIMITY_ENTERING}. If the value is true, the device is
     * entering the proximity region; if false, it is exiting.
     *
     * <p> Due to the approximate nature of position estimation, if the
     * device passes through the given area briefly, it is possible
     * that no Intent will be fired.  Similarly, an Intent could be
     * fired if the device passes very close to the given area but
     * does not actually enter it.
     *
     * <p> After the number of milliseconds given by the expiration
     * parameter, the location manager will delete this proximity
     * alert and no longer monitor it.  A value of -1 indicates that
     * there should be no expiration time.
     *
     * <p> Internally, this method uses both {@link #NETWORK_PROVIDER}
     * and {@link #GPS_PROVIDER}.
     *
     * <p>Before API version 17, this method could be used with
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} or
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION}.
     * From API version 17 and onwards, this method requires
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} permission.
     *
     * @param latitude the latitude of the central point of the
     * alert region
     * @param longitude the longitude of the central point of the
     * alert region
     * @param radius the radius of the central point of the
     * alert region, in meters
     * @param expiration time for this proximity alert, in milliseconds,
     * or -1 to indicate no expiration
     * @param intent a PendingIntent that will be used to generate an Intent to
     * fire when entry to or exit from the alert region is detected
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION}
     * permission is not present
