     * Given a millisecond time value (msec), return the interpolated values and
     * return whether the specified time was within the range of key times
     * (NORMAL), was before the first key time (FREEZE_START) or after the last
     * key time (FREEZE_END). In any event, computed values are always returned.
     * 
     * @param msec The time (in milliseconds) used to sample into the
     *        Interpolator. Based on the SystemClock.uptimeMillis() clock
     * @param values Where to write the computed values (may be NULL).
     * @return how the values were computed (even if values == null)
