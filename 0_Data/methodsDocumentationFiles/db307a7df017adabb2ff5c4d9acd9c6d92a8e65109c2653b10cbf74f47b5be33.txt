     * Detects if this View is enabled and has a drag event listener.
     * If both are true, then it calls the drag event listener with the
     * {@link android.view.DragEvent} it received. If the drag event listener returns
     * {@code true}, then dispatchDragEvent() returns {@code true}.
     * <p>
     * For all other cases, the method calls the
     * {@link android.view.View#onDragEvent(DragEvent) onDragEvent()} drag event handler
     * method and returns its result.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This ensures that a drag event is always consumed, even if the View does not have a drag
     * event listener. However, if the View has a listener and the listener returns true, then
     * onDragEvent() is not called.
     * </p>
