     * Create a predefined vibration effect.
     *
     * Predefined effects are a set of common vibration effects that should be identical, regardless
     * of the app they come from, in order to provide a cohesive experience for users across
     * the entire device. They also may be custom tailored to the device hardware in order to
     * provide a better experience than you could otherwise build using the generic building
     * blocks.
     *
     * This will fallback to a generic pattern if one exists and there does not exist a
     * hardware-specific implementation of the effect.
     *
     * @param effectId The ID of the effect to perform:
     *                 {@link #EFFECT_CLICK}, {@link #EFFECT_DOUBLE_CLICK}, {@link #EFFECT_TICK}
     *
     * @return The desired effect.
