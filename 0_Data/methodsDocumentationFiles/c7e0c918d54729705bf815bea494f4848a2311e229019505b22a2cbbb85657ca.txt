     * Change the HardwareRenderer's opacity. Will take effect on the next frame produced.
     *
     * <p>If the renderer is set to opaque it is the app's responsibility to ensure that the
     * content renders to every pixel of the Surface, otherwise corruption may result. Note that
     * this includes ensuring that the first draw of any given pixel does not attempt to blend
     * against the destination. If this is false then the hardware renderer will clear to
     * transparent at the start of every frame.
     *
     * @param opaque true if the content rendered is opaque, false if the renderer should clear
     *               to transparent before rendering
