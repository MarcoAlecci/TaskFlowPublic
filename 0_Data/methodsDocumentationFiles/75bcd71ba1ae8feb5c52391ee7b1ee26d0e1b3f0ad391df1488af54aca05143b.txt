         * Scroll horizontally by dx pixels in screen coordinates and return the distance traveled.
         * The default implementation does nothing and returns 0.

         * @param dx            distance to scroll by in pixels. X increases as scroll position
         *                      approaches the right.
         * @param recycler      Recycler to use for fetching potentially cached views for a
         *                      position
         * @param state         Transient state of RecyclerView
         * @return The actual distance scrolled. The return value will be negative if dx was
         * negative and scrolling proceeeded in that direction.
         * <code>Math.abs(result)</code> may be less than dx if a boundary was reached.
