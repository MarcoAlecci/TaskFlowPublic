     * This method is added for SetupWizard, to force an update of the suggested locales
     * when the SIM is initialized.
     *
     * <p>When the device is freshly started, it sometimes gets to the language selection
     * before the SIM is properly initialized.
     * So at the time the cache is filled, the info from the SIM might not be available.
     * The SetupWizard has a SimLocaleMonitor class to detect onSubscriptionsChanged events.
     * SetupWizard will call this function when that happens.</p>
     *
     * <p>TODO: decide if it is worth moving such kind of monitoring in this shared code.
     * The user might change the SIM or might cross border and connect to a network
     * in a different country, without restarting the Settings application or the phone.</p>
