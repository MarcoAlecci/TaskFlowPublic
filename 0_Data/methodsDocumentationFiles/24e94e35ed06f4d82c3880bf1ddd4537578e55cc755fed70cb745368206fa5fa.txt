     * Same as quadTo, but the coordinates are considered relative to the last
     * point on this contour. If there is no previous point, then a moveTo(0,0)
     * is inserted automatically.

     * @param dx1 The amount to add to the x-coordinate of the last point on
     *            this contour, for the control point of a quadratic curve
     * @param dy1 The amount to add to the y-coordinate of the last point on
     *            this contour, for the control point of a quadratic curve
     * @param dx2 The amount to add to the x-coordinate of the last point on
     *            this contour, for the end point of a quadratic curve
     * @param dy2 The amount to add to the y-coordinate of the last point on
     *            this contour, for the end point of a quadratic curve
