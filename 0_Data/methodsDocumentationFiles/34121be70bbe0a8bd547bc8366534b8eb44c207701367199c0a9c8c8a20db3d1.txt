     * Obtain an {@link Intent} that will launch an explicit target activity specified by
     * this activity's logical parent. The logical parent is named in the application's manifest
     * by the {@link android.R.attr#parentActivityName parentActivityName} attribute.
     * Activity subclasses may override this method to modify the Intent returned by
     * super.getParentActivityIntent() or to implement a different mechanism of retrieving
     * the parent intent entirely.
     *
     * @return a new Intent targeting the defined parent of this activity or null if
     *         there is no valid parent.
