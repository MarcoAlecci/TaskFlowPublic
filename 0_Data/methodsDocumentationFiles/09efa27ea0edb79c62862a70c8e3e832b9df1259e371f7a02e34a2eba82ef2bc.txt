     * <ul>
     * <li>If this reader is a SIM reader, then its name must be "SIM[Slot]".</li>
     * <li>If the reader is a SD or micro SD reader, then its name must be "SD[Slot]"</li>
     * <li>If the reader is a embedded SE reader, then its name must be "eSE[Slot]"</li>
     * </ul>
     * Slot is a decimal number without leading zeros. The Numbering must start with 1
     * (e.g. SIM1, SIM2, ... or SD1, SD2, ... or eSE1, eSE2, ...).
     * The slot number ?1? for a reader is optional
     * (SIM and SIM1 are both valid for the first SIM-reader,
     * but if there are two readers then the second reader must be named SIM2).
     * This applies also for other SD or SE readers.
     *
     * @return the reader name, as a String.
