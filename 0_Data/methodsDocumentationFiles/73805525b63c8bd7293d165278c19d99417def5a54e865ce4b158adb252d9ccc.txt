     * Gets the complete list of fully defined transitions.
     * <p>
     * The complete set of transitions for this rules instance is defined by this method
     * and {@link #getTransitionRules()}. This method returns those transitions that have
     * been fully defined. These are typically historical, but may be in the future.
     * <p>
     * The list will be empty for fixed offset rules and for any time-zone where there has
     * only ever been a single offset. The list will also be empty if the transition rules are unknown.
     *
     * @return an immutable list of fully defined transitions, not null
