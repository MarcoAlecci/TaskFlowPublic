     * Set a end hyphen edit on the paint.
     *
     * By setting end hyphen edit, the measurement and drawing is performed with modifying
     * hyphenation at the end of line. For example, by passing
     * {@link #END_HYPHEN_EDIT_INSERT_HYPHEN} like as follows, HYPHEN(U+2010)
     * character is appended at the end of line.
     *
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     *   Paint paint = new Paint();
     *   paint.setEndHyphenEdit(Paint.END_HYPHEN_EDIT_INSERT_HYPHEN);
     *   paint.measureText("abc", 0, 3);  // Returns the width of "abc-"
     *   Canvas.drawText("abc", 0, 3, 0f, 0f, paint);  // Draws "abc-"
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     *
     * The default value is 0 which is equivalent to {@link #END_HYPHEN_EDIT_NO_EDIT}.
     *
     * @param endHyphen a end hyphen edit value.
     * @see #getEndHyphenEdit()
