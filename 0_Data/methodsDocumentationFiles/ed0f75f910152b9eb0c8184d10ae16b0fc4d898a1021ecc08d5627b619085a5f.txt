     * Returns a Bundle that contains the Intent of the activity that can be used to edit the
     * properties. In order to indicate success the activity should call response.setResult()
     * with a non-null Bundle.
     * @param response used to set the result for the request. If the Constants.INTENT_KEY
     *   is set in the bundle then this response field is to be used for sending future
     *   results if and when the Intent is started.
     * @param accountType the AccountType whose properties are to be edited.
     * @return a Bundle containing the result or the Intent to start to continue the request.
     *   If this is null then the request is considered to still be active and the result should
     *   sent later using response.
