     * Returns resolved {@link TextDirectionHeuristic} that will be used for text layout.
     * The {@link TextDirectionHeuristic} that is used by TextView is only available after
     * {@link #getTextDirection()} and {@link #getLayoutDirection()} is resolved. Therefore the
     * return value may not be the same as the one TextView uses if the View's layout direction is
     * not resolved or detached from parent root view.
