     * Returns the maximum length of a sequential characters. A sequence is defined as
     * monotonically increasing characters with a constant interval or the same character repeated.
     *
     * For example:
     * maxLengthSequence("1234") == 4
     * maxLengthSequence("13579") == 5
     * maxLengthSequence("1234abc") == 4
     * maxLengthSequence("aabc") == 3
     * maxLengthSequence("qwertyuio") == 1
     * maxLengthSequence("@ABC") == 3
     * maxLengthSequence(";;;;") == 4 (anything that repeats)
     * maxLengthSequence(":;<=>") == 1  (ordered, but not composed of alphas or digits)
     *
     * @param bytes the pass
     * @return the number of sequential letters or digits
