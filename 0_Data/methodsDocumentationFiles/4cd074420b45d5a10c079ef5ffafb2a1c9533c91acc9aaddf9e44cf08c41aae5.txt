     * Sets whether this view shows leading zeroes.
     * <p>
     * When leading zeroes are shown, the displayed value will be padded
     * with zeroes to the width of the maximum value as specified by
     * {@link #setRange(int, int)} (see also {@link #getRangeMaximum()}.
     * <p>
     * For example, with leading zeroes shown, a maximum of 99 and value of
     * 9 would display "09". A maximum of 100 and a value of 9 would display
     * "009". With leading zeroes hidden, both cases would show "9".
     *
     * @param showLeadingZeroes {@code true} to show leading zeroes,
     *                          {@code false} to hide them
