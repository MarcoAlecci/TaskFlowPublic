     * Called when the user presses the back button while focus is in the session UI.  Note
     * that this will only happen if the session UI has requested input focus in its window;
     * otherwise, the back key will go to whatever window has focus and do whatever behavior
     * it normally has there.  The default implementation simply calls {@link #hide}.
