     * Move the cursor, if needed, so that it is at an offset that is visible
     * to the user.  This will not move the cursor if it represents more than
     * one character (a selection range).  This will only work if the
     * TextView contains spannable text; otherwise it will do nothing.

     * @return True if the cursor was actually moved, false otherwise.
