     * Sets whether foreign key constraints are enabled for the database.
     * <p>
     * By default, foreign key constraints are not enforced by the database.
     * This method allows an application to enable foreign key constraints.
     * It must be called each time the database is opened to ensure that foreign
     * key constraints are enabled for the session.
     * </p><p>
     * A good time to call this method is right after calling {@link #openOrCreateDatabase}
     * or in the {@link SQLiteOpenHelper#onConfigure} callback.
     * </p><p>
     * When foreign key constraints are disabled, the database does not check whether
     * changes to the database will violate foreign key constraints.  Likewise, when
     * foreign key constraints are disabled, the database will not execute cascade
     * delete or update triggers.  As a result, it is possible for the database
     * state to become inconsistent.  To perform a database integrity check,
     * call {@link #isDatabaseIntegrityOk}.
     * </p><p>
     * This method must not be called while a transaction is in progress.
     * </p><p>
     * See also <a href="http://sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html">SQLite Foreign Key Constraints</a>
     * for more details about foreign key constraint support.

     * @param enable True to enable foreign key constraints, false to disable them.
