         * Compare this key against other native keys, request keys, result keys, and
         * characteristics keys.
         *
         * <p>Two keys are considered equal if their name and type reference are equal.</p>
         *
         * <p>Note that the equality against non-native keys is one-way. A native key may be equal
         * to a result key; but that same result key will not be equal to a native key.</p>
