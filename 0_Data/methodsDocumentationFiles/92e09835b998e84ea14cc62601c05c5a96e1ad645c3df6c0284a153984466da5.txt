     * This method returns true when the parcel is 'definitely' empty.
     * That is, it may return false for an empty parcel. But will never return true for a non-empty
     * one.
     *
     * @hide this should probably be the implementation of isEmpty().  To do that we
     * need to ensure we always use the special empty parcel form when the bundle is
     * empty.  (This may already be the case, but to be safe we'll do this later when
     * we aren't trying to stabilize.)
