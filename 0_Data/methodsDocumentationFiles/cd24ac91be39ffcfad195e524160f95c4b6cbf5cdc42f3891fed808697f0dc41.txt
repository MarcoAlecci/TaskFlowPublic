     * Requests a frontend resource.
     *
     * <p>There are three possible scenarios:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If there is frontend available, the API would send the id back.
     *
     * <li>If no Frontend is available but the current request info can show higher priority than
     * other uses of Frontend, the API will send
     * {@link IResourcesReclaimListener#onReclaimResources()} to the {@link Tuner}. Tuner would
     * handle the resource reclaim on the holder of lower priority and notify the holder of its
     * resource loss.
     *
     * <li>If no frontend can be granted, the API would return false.
     * <ul>
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> {@link #setFrontendInfoList(TunerFrontendInfo[])} must be called
     * before this request.
     *
     * @param request {@link TunerFrontendRequest} information of the current request.
     * @param frontendHandle a one-element array to return the granted frontendHandle. If
     *                       no frontend granted, this will return {@link #INVALID_RESOURCE_HANDLE}.
     *
     * @return true if there is frontend granted.
