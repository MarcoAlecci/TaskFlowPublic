     * Constructs and returns a PropertyValuesHolder with a given property name and
     * a Path along which the values should be animated. This variant supports a
     * <code>TypeConverter</code> to convert from <code>PointF</code> to the target
     * type.
     *
     * <p>The PointF passed to <code>converter</code> or <code>property</code>, if
     * <code>converter</code> is <code>null</code>, is reused on each animation frame and should
     * not be stored by the setter or TypeConverter.</p>
     *
     * @param propertyName The name of the property being animated.

     *                  null if conversion is unnecessary.
     * @param path The Path along which the values should be animated.
