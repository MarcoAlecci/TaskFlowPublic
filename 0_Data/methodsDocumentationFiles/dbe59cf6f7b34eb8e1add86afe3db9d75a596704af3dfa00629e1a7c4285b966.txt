         * Called by the RecyclerView when a ViewHolder is added to the layout.
         * <p>
         * In detail, this means that the ViewHolder was <b>not</b> a child when the layout started
         * but has  been added by the LayoutManager. It might be newly added to the adapter or
         * simply become visible due to other factors.
         * <p>
         * ItemAnimator must call {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished(ViewHolder)} when the animation
         * is complete (or instantly call {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished(ViewHolder)} if it
         * decides not to animate the view).
         *
         * @param viewHolder     The ViewHolder which should be animated
         * @param preLayoutInfo  The information that was returned from
         *                       {@link #recordPreLayoutInformation(State, ViewHolder, int, List)}.
         *                       Might be null if Item was just added to the adapter or
         *                       LayoutManager does not support predictive animations or it could
         *                       not predict that this ViewHolder will become visible.
         * @param postLayoutInfo The information that was returned from {@link
         *                       #recordPreLayoutInformation(State, ViewHolder, int, List)}.
         *
         * @return true if a later call to {@link #runPendingAnimations()} is requested,
         * false otherwise.
