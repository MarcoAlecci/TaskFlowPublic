     * Similar method as #sendMultipartTextMessage(String, String, ArrayList, ArrayList, ArrayList)
     * With an additional argument.

     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This method is intended for internal use the Telephony
     * framework and will never trigger an SMS disambiguation dialog. If this method is called on a
     * device that has multiple active subscriptions, this {@link SmsManager} instance has been
     * created with {@link #getDefault()}, and no user-defined default subscription is defined, the
     * subscription ID associated with this message will be INVALID, which will result in the SMS
     * being sent on the subscription associated with logical slot 0. Use
     * {@link #getSmsManagerForSubscriptionId(int)} to ensure the SMS is sent on the correct
     * subscription.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param packageName serves as the default package name if the package name that is
     *        associated with the user id is null.
