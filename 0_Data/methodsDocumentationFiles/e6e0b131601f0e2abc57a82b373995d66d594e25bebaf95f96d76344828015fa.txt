     * Set whether this view is currently tracking transient state that the
     * framework should attempt to preserve when possible. This flag is reference counted,
     * so every call to setHasTransientState(true) should be paired with a later call
     * to setHasTransientState(false).
     *
     * <p>A view with transient state cannot be trivially rebound from an external
     * data source, such as an adapter binding item views in a list. This may be
     * because the view is performing an animation, tracking user selection
     * of content, or similar.</p>

     * @param hasTransientState true if this view has transient state
