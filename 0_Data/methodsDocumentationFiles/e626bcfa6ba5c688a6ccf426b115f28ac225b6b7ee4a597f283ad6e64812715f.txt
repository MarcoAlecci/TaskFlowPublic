     * This is how far in advance a buffer must be queued for presentation at
     * a given time.  If you want a buffer to appear on the screen at
     * time N, you must submit the buffer before (N - presentationDeadline).
     * <p>
     * The desired presentation time for GLES rendering may be set with
     * {@link android.opengl.EGLExt#eglPresentationTimeANDROID}.  For video decoding, use
     * {@link android.media.MediaCodec#releaseOutputBuffer(int, long)}.  Times are
     * expressed in nanoseconds, using the system monotonic clock
     * ({@link System#nanoTime}).
