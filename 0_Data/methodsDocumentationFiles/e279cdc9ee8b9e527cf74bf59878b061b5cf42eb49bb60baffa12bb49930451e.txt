     * Change the current system wallpaper to a bitmap, specifying a hint about
     * which subrectangle of the full image is to be visible.  The OS will then
     * try to best present the given portion of the full image as the static system
     * wallpaper image.  On success, the intent
     * {@link Intent#ACTION_WALLPAPER_CHANGED} is broadcast.
     *
     * <p>Passing {@code null} as the {@code visibleHint} parameter is equivalent to
     * passing (0, 0, {@code fullImage.getWidth()}, {@code fullImage.getHeight()}).
     *
     * <p>This method requires the caller to hold the permission
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#SET_WALLPAPER}.
     *
     * @param fullImage A bitmap that will supply the wallpaper imagery.
     * @param visibleCropHint The rectangular subregion of {@code fullImage} that should be
     *     displayed as wallpaper.  Passing {@code null} for this parameter means that
     *     the full image should be displayed if possible given the image's and device's
     *     aspect ratios, etc.
     * @param allowBackup {@code true} if the OS is permitted to back up this wallpaper
     *     image for restore to a future device; {@code false} otherwise.
     *
     * @return An integer ID assigned to the newly active wallpaper; or zero on failure.
     *
     * @throws IOException If an error occurs when attempting to set the wallpaper
     *     to the provided image.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the {@code visibleCropHint} rectangle is
     *     empty or invalid.
