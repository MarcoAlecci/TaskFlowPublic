     * Determine whether a particular process and user ID has been granted
     * permission to access a specific URI.  This only checks for permissions
     * that have been explicitly granted -- if the given process/uid has
     * more general access to the URI's content provider then this check will
     * always fail.
     *
     * @param uri The uri that is being checked.
     * @param pid The process ID being checked against.  Must be &gt; 0.
     * @param uid The user ID being checked against.  A uid of 0 is the root
     * user, which will pass every permission check.
     * @param modeFlags The access modes to check.
     *
     * @return {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_GRANTED} if the given
     * pid/uid is allowed to access that uri, or
     * {@link PackageManager#PERMISSION_DENIED} if it is not.
