     * developed in lock-step with the OS, and they aren't updated outside of an OTA, so we want to
     * chase any {@link StrictMode} regressions by enabling detection when running on {@link
     * Build#IS_USERDEBUG} or {@link Build#IS_ENG} builds.
     *
     * <p>Unbundled apps included in the system image are expected to detect and triage their own
     * {@link StrictMode} issues separate from the OS release process, which is why we don't enable
     * them here.
