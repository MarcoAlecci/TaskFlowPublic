     * Called by Transition to alter the Animator start delay. All start delays will be adjusted
     * such that the minimum becomes zero.
     * @param sceneRoot The root of the View hierarchy running the transition.
     * @param transition The transition that created the Animator
     * @param startValues The values for a specific target in the start scene.
     * @param endValues The values for the target in the end scene.
     * @return A start delay to use with the Animator created by <code>transition</code>. The
     * delay will be offset by the minimum delay of all <code>TransitionPropagation</code>s
     * used in the Transition so that the smallest delay will be 0. Returned values may be
     * negative.
