     * thread asynchronous. While doing that run and process all finishers on this thread. The
     * finishers can be implemented in a way to check weather the queued work is finished.
     *
     * Is called from the Activity base class's onPause(), after BroadcastReceiver's onReceive,
     * after Service command handling, etc. (so async work is never lost)
