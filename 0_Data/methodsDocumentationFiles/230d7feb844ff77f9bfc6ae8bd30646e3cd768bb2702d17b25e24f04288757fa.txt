     * Initializes this cipher with the public key from the given certificate
     * and
     * a source of randomness.
     *
     * <p>The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations:
     * encryption, decryption, key wrapping
     * or key unwrapping, depending on
     * the value of <code>opmode</code>.
     *
     * <p>If the certificate is of type X.509 and has a <i>key usage</i>
     * extension field marked as critical, and the value of the <i>key usage</i>
     * extension field implies that the public key in
     * the certificate and its corresponding private key are not
     * supposed to be used for the operation represented by the value of
     * <code>opmode</code>,
     * an <code>InvalidKeyException</code>
     * is thrown.
     *
     * <p>If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be
     * derived from the public key in the given <code>certificate</code>,
     * the underlying cipher
     * implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself
     * (using provider-specific default or random values) if it is being
     * initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an
     * <code>InvalidKeyException</code> if it is being
     * initialized for decryption or key unwrapping.
     * The generated parameters can be retrieved using
     * {@link #getParameters() getParameters} or
     * {@link #getIV() getIV} (if the parameter is an IV).
     *
     * <p>If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be
     * derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable
     * provider-specific default values, initialization will
     * necessarily fail.
     *
     * <p>If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme)
     * requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get
     * them from <code>random</code>.
     *
     * <p>Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all
     * previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is
     * equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing
     * it.
     *
     * @param opmode the operation mode of this cipher (this is one of the
     * following:
     * <code>ENCRYPT_MODE</code>, <code>DECRYPT_MODE</code>,
     * <code>WRAP_MODE</code> or <code>UNWRAP_MODE</code>)
     * @param certificate the certificate
     * @param random the source of randomness
     *
     * @exception InvalidKeyException if the public key in the given
     * certificate is inappropriate for initializing this cipher, or this
     * cipher
     * requires algorithm parameters that cannot be determined from the
     * public key in the given certificate, or the keysize of the public key
     * in the given certificate has a keysize that exceeds the maximum
     * allowable keysize (as determined by the configured jurisdiction policy
     * files).
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if (@code opmode} is
     * {@code WRAP_MODE} or {@code UNWRAP_MODE} but the mode is not implemented
     * by the underlying {@code CipherSpi}.
