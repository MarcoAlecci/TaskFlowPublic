     * Sends a datagram packet from this socket. The
     * {@code DatagramPacket} includes information indicating the
     * data to be sent, its length, the IP address of the remote host,
     * and the port number on the remote host.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager, and the socket is not currently
     * connected to a remote address, this method first performs some
     * security checks. First, if {@code p.getAddress().isMulticastAddress()}
     * is true, this method calls the
     * security manager's {@code checkMulticast} method
     * with {@code p.getAddress()} as its argument.
     * If the evaluation of that expression is false,
     * this method instead calls the security manager's
     * {@code checkConnect} method with arguments
     * {@code p.getAddress().getHostAddress()} and
     * {@code p.getPort()}. Each call to a security manager method
     * could result in a SecurityException if the operation is not allowed.
     *
     * @param      p   the {@code DatagramPacket} to be sent.
     *
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
     *             {@code checkMulticast} or {@code checkConnect}
     *             method doesn't allow the send.
     * @exception  PortUnreachableException may be thrown if the socket is connected
     *             to a currently unreachable destination. Note, there is no
     *             guarantee that the exception will be thrown.
     * @exception  java.nio.channels.IllegalBlockingModeException
     *             if this socket has an associated channel,
     *             and the channel is in non-blocking mode.
     * @exception  IllegalArgumentException if the socket is connected,
     *             and connected address and packet address differ.
