     * Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint,
     * transformed by the current matrix.
     * <p>
     * Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the
     * bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it
     * were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be
     * the edge color replicated.
     * <p>
     * If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of
     * automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas.
     *
     * @param bitmap The bitmap to be drawn
     * @param left The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn
     * @param top The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn
     * @param paint The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
