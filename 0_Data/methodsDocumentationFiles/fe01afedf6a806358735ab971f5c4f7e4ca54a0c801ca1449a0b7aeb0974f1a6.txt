     * Notify the host application that a page has started loading. This method
     * is called once for each main frame load so a page with iframes or
     * framesets will call onPageStarted one time for the main frame. This also
     * means that onPageStarted will not be called when the contents of an
     * embedded frame changes, i.e. clicking a link whose target is an iframe,
     * it will also not be called for fragment navigations (navigations to
     * #fragment_id).
     *
     * @param view The WebView that is initiating the callback.
     * @param url The url to be loaded.
     * @param favicon The favicon for this page if it already exists in the
     *            database.
