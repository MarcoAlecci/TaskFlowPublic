     * Equivalent to {@link #tryComplete} but does not invoke {@link
     * #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)} along the completion path:
     * If the pending count is nonzero, decrements the count;
     * otherwise, similarly tries to complete this task's completer, if
     * one exists, else marks this task as complete. This method may be
     * useful in cases where {@code onCompletion} should not, or need
     * not, be invoked for each completer in a computation.
