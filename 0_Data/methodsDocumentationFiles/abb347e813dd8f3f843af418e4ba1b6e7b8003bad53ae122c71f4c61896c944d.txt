     * A key response is received from the license server by the app, then it is
     * provided to the DRM engine plugin using provideKeyResponse. When the
     * response is for an offline key request, a key-set identifier is returned that
     * can be used to later restore the keys to a new session with the method
     * {@ link # restoreKeys}.
     * When the response is for a streaming or release request, null is returned.
     *
     * @param keySetId When the response is for a release request, keySetId identifies
     * the saved key associated with the release request (i.e., the same keySetId
     * passed to the earlier {@ link # getKeyRequest} call. It MUST be null when the
     * response is for either streaming or offline key requests.
     *
     * @param response the byte array response from the server
     *
     * @throws NoDrmSchemeException if there is no active DRM session
     * @throws DeniedByServerException if the response indicates that the
     * server rejected the request
