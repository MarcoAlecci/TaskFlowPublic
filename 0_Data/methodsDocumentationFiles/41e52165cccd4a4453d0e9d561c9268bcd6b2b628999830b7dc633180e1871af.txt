     * Get the estimated horizontal accuracy of this location, radial, in meters.
     *
     * <p>We define horizontal accuracy as the radius of 68% confidence. In other
     * words, if you draw a circle centered at this location's
     * latitude and longitude, and with a radius equal to the accuracy,
     * then there is a 68% probability that the true location is inside
     * the circle.
     *
     * <p>This accuracy estimation is only concerned with horizontal
     * accuracy, and does not indicate the accuracy of bearing,
     * velocity or altitude if those are included in this Location.
     *
     * <p>If this location does not have a horizontal accuracy, then 0.0 is returned.
     * All locations generated by the {@link LocationManager} include horizontal accuracy.
