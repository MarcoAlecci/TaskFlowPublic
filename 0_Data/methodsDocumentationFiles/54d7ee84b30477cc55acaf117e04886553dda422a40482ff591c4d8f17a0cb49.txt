     * Return whether or not suggestions are enabled on this TextView. The suggestions are generated
     * by the IME or by the spell checker as the user types. This is done by adding
     * {@link SuggestionSpan}s to the text.
     *
     * When suggestions are enabled (default), this list of suggestions will be displayed when the
     * user asks for them on these parts of the text. This value depends on the inputType of this
     * TextView.
     *
     * The class of the input type must be {@link InputType#TYPE_CLASS_TEXT}.
     *
     * In addition, the type variation must be one of
     * {@link InputType#TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_NORMAL},
     * {@link InputType#TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_EMAIL_SUBJECT},
     * {@link InputType#TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_LONG_MESSAGE},
     * {@link InputType#TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_SHORT_MESSAGE} or
     * {@link InputType#TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_WEB_EDIT_TEXT}.
     *
     * And finally, the {@link InputType#TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS} flag must <i>not</i> be set.
     *
     * @return true if the suggestions popup window is enabled, based on the inputType.
