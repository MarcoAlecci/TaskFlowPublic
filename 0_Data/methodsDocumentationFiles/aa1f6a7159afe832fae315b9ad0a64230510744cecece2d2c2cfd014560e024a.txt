     * DTBSV solves one of the systems of equations
     * A*x = b   or   A**T*x = b
     *
     * Details: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d4/dcf/dtbsv_8f.html
     *
     * Note: For a N*N matrix, the input Allocation should also be of size N*N (dimY = N, dimX = N),
     *       but only the region N*(K+1) will be referenced. The following subroutine can is an
     *       example showing how to convert a UPPER trianglar matrix 'a' to row-based band matrix 'b'.
     *           for i in range(0, n):
     *              for j in range(i, min(i+k+1, n)):
     *                  b[i, j-i] = a[i, j]
     *
     * @param Uplo Specifies whether the matrix is an upper or lower triangular matrix.
     * @param TransA The type of transpose applied to matrix A.
     * @param Diag Specifies whether or not A is unit triangular.
     * @param K The number of off-diagonals of the matrix A
     * @param A The input allocation contains matrix A, supported elements type {@link Element#F64}.
     * @param X The input allocation contains vector x, supported elements type {@link Element#F64}.
     * @param incX The increment for the elements of vector x, must be larger than zero.
