     * Temporarily put the cache in the uninitialized state and prevent invalidations from
     * moving it out of that state: useful in cases where we want to avoid the overhead of a
     * large number of cache invalidations in a short time.  While the cache is corked, clients
     * bypass the cache and talk to backing services directly.  This property makes corking
     * correctness-preserving even if corked outside the lock that controls access to the
     * cache's backing service.
     *
     * corkInvalidations() and uncorkInvalidations() must be called in pairs.

     * @param name Name of the cache-key property to cork
