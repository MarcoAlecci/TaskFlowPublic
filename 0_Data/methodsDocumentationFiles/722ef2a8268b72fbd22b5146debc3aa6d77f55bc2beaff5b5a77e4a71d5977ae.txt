     * Returns the orientation of the touch area and tool area in radians clockwise from vertical
     * for the given pointer <em>index</em> (use {@link #getPointerId(int)} to find the pointer
     * identifier for this index).
     * An angle of 0 radians indicates that the major axis of contact is oriented
     * upwards, is perfectly circular or is of unknown orientation.  A positive angle
     * indicates that the major axis of contact is oriented to the right.  A negative angle
     * indicates that the major axis of contact is oriented to the left.
     * The full range is from -PI/2 radians (finger pointing fully left) to PI/2 radians
     * (finger pointing fully right).
     * @param pointerIndex Raw index of pointer to retrieve.  Value may be from 0
     * (the first pointer that is down) to {@link #getPointerCount()}-1.
