     * Write some data and increment the current position.
     *
     * The 8-bit limit on access to bitwise streams is intentional to
     * avoid endianness issues.
     *
     * @param bits the amount of data to write (gte 0, lte 8)
     * @param data to write, will be masked to expose only bits param from lsb
