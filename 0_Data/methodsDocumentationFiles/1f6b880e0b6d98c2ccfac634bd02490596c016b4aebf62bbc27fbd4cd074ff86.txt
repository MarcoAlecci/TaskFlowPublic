         * get Knee Width in decibels (dB) around compressor threshold point. Widths are always
         * positive, with higher values representing a wider area of transition from the linear zone
         * to the compression zone. A knee of 0 dB means a more abrupt transition.
         * @return Knee Width in decibels (dB)
