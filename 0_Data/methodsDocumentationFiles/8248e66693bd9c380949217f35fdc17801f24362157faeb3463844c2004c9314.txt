     * Create an Inet6Address in the exact manner of {@link
     * InetAddress#getByAddress(String,byte[])} except that the IPv6 scope_id is
     * set to the given numeric value. The scope_id is not checked to determine
     * if it corresponds to any interface on the system.
     * See <a href="Inet6Address.html#scoped">here</a> for a description of IPv6
     * scoped addresses.
     *
     * @param host the specified host
     * @param addr the raw IP address in network byte order
     * @param scope_id the numeric scope_id for the address.
     * @return  an Inet6Address object created from the raw IP address.
     * @throws  UnknownHostException  if IP address is of illegal length.
