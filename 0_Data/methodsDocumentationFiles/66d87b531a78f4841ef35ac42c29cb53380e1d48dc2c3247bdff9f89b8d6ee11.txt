     * Checks whether your app has a given permission and whether the app op
     * that corresponds to this permission is allowed.
     *
     * <strong>NOTE:</strong> Use this method only for permission checks at the
     * preflight point where you will not deliver the permission protected data
     * to clients but schedule permission data delivery, apps register listeners,
     * etc.
     *
     * <p>For example, if an app registers a location listener it should have the location
     * permission but no data is actually sent to the app at the moment of registration
     * and you should use this method to determine if the app has or may have location
     * permission (if app has only foreground location the grant state depends on the
     * app's fg/gb state) and this check will not leave a trace that permission protected
     * data was delivered. When you are about to deliver the location data to a registered
     * listener you should use this method which will evaluate the permission access based
     * on the current fg/bg state of the app and leave a record that the data was accessed.
     *
     * <p>This API assumes the the {@link Binder#getCallingUid()} is the same as
     * {@link Process#myUid()}.

     * @param context Context for accessing resources.
