     * Call this during {@link Callback#onKeyDown} to have the system track
     * the key through its final up (possibly including a long press).  Note
     * that only one key can be tracked at a time -- if another key down
     * event is received while a previous one is being tracked, tracking is
     * stopped on the previous event.
