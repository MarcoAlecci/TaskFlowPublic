     * This method is called every time the layout is reflowed after an edition.
     * It updates the internal block data structure. The text is split in blocks
     * of contiguous lines, with at least one block for the entire text.
     * When a range of lines is edited, new blocks (from 0 to 3 depending on the
     * overlap structure) will replace the set of overlapping blocks.
     * Blocks are listed in order and are represented by their ending line number.
     * An index is associated to each block (which will be used by display lists),
     * this class simply invalidates the index of blocks overlapping a modification.
     *
     * @param startLine the first line of the range of modified lines
     * @param endLine the last line of the range, possibly equal to startLine, lower
     * than getLineCount()
     * @param newLineCount the number of lines that will replace the range, possibly 0
