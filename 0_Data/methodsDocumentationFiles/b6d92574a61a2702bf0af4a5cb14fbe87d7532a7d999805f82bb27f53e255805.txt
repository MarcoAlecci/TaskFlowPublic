     * Represents whether to enable full GNSS tracking.
     *
     * <p>If true, GNSS chipset switches off duty cycling. In such a mode, no clock
     * discontinuities are expected, and when supported, carrier phase should be continuous in
     * good signal conditions. All non-blacklisted, healthy constellations, satellites and
     * frequency bands that the chipset supports must be reported in this mode. The GNSS chipset
     * is allowed to consume more power in this mode. If false, GNSS chipset optimizes power via
     * duty cycling, constellations and frequency limits, etc.
