     * method (e.g. a globe key.).

     * the IME has to offer ways to to invoke {@link #switchToNextInputMethod} accordingly.
     * <p> Note that the system determines the most appropriate next input method
     * and subtype in order to provide the consistent user experience in switching
     * between IMEs and subtypes.
