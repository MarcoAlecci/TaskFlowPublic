     * Apply this matrix to the array of 2D points specified by src, and write the transformed
     * points into the array of points specified by dst. The two arrays represent their "points" as
     * pairs of floats [x, y].
     *
     * @param dst The array of dst points (x,y pairs)
     * @param src The array of src points (x,y pairs)
