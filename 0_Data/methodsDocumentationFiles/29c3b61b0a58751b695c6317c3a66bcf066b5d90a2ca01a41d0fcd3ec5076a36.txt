     * Notifies the Android System that an
     * {@link AutofillService#onSaveRequest(SaveRequest, SaveCallback)} was successfully handled
     * by the service.
     *
     * <p>This method is useful when the service requires extra work&mdash;for example, launching an
     * activity asking the user to authenticate first &mdash;before it can process the request,
     * as the intent will be launched from the context of the activity being autofilled and hence
     * will be part of that activity's stack.
     *
     * @param intentSender intent that will be launched from the context of activity being
     * autofilled.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this method, {@link #onSuccess()},
     * or {@link #onFailure(CharSequence)} was already called.
