     * Make note of an application performing an operation.  Note that you must pass
     * in both the uid and name of the application to be checked; this function will verify
     * that these two match, and if not, return {@link #MODE_IGNORED}.  If this call
     * succeeds, the last execution time of the operation for this app will be updated to
     * the current time.
     *
     * <p>If this is a check that is not preceding the protected operation, use
     * {@link #unsafeCheckOp} instead.
     *
     * @param op The operation to note.  One of the OPSTR_* constants.
     * @param uid The user id of the application attempting to perform the operation.
     * @param packageName The name of the application attempting to perform the operation.
     * @param attributionTag The {@link Context#createAttributionContext attribution tag} or {@code
     * null} for default attribution
     * @param message A message describing the reason the op was noted
     *
     * @return Returns {@link #MODE_ALLOWED} if the operation is allowed, or
     * {@link #MODE_IGNORED} if it is not allowed and should be silently ignored (without
     * causing the app to crash).
     *
     * @throws SecurityException If the app has been configured to crash on this op.
