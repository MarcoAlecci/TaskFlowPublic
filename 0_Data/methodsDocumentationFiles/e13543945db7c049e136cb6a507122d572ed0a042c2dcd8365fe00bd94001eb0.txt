     * when it was started, which allows it to perform this operation on

     * @param flags Provides additional operating flags.  Currently may be
     * 0 or have the {@link #HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY},
     * {@link #HIDE_NOT_ALWAYS} bit set.
     * @deprecated Use {@link InputMethodService#requestHideSelf(int)} instead. This method was
     * intended for IME developers who should be accessing APIs through the service. APIs in this
     * class are intended for app developers interacting with the IME.
