     * Configures <a href="https://sqlite.org/malloc.html#lookaside">lookaside memory allocator</a>
     *
     * <p>This method should be called from the constructor of the subclass,
     * before opening the database, since lookaside memory configuration can only be changed
     * when no connection is using it
     *
     * <p>SQLite default settings will be used, if this method isn't called.
     * Use {@code setLookasideConfig(0,0)} to disable lookaside
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Provided slotSize/slotCount configuration is just a recommendation.
     * The system may choose different values depending on a device, e.g. lookaside allocations
     * can be disabled on low-RAM devices
     *
     * @param slotSize The size in bytes of each lookaside slot.
     * @param slotCount The total number of lookaside memory slots per database connection.
