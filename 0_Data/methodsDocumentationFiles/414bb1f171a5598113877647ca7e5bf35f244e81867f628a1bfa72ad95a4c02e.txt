     * Returns the set of property names used stored in the {@link TransitionValues}
     * object passed into {@link #captureStartValues(TransitionValues)} that
     * this transition cares about for the purposes of canceling overlapping animations.
     * When any transition is started on a given scene root, all transitions
     * currently running on that same scene root are checked to see whether the
     * properties on which they based their animations agree with the end values of
     * the same properties in the new transition. If the end values are not equal,
     * then the old animation is canceled since the new transition will start a new
     * animation to these new values. If the values are equal, the old animation is
     * allowed to continue and no new animation is started for that transition.
     *
     * <p>A transition does not need to override this method. However, not doing so
     * will mean that the cancellation logic outlined in the previous paragraph
     * will be skipped for that transition, possibly leading to artifacts as
     * old transitions and new transitions on the same targets run in parallel,
     * animating views toward potentially different end values.</p>
     *
     * @return An array of property names as described in the class documentation for
     * {@link TransitionValues}. The default implementation returns <code>null</code>.
