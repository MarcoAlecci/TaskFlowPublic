     * Remove permissions to access a particular content provider Uri
     * that were previously added with {@link #grantSlicePermission} for a specific target
     * package.  The given Uri will match all previously granted Uris that are the same or a
     * sub-path of the given Uri.  That is, revoking "content://foo/target" will
     * revoke both "content://foo/target" and "content://foo/target/sub", but not
     * "content://foo".  It will not remove any prefix grants that exist at a
     * higher level.
     *
     * @param toPackage The package you would like to allow to access the Uri.
     * @param uri The Uri you would like to revoke access to.
