     * Return total size in bytes of all cached data belonging to the calling
     * app on the given storage volume.
     * <p>
     * Cached data tracked by this method always includes
     * {@link Context#getCacheDir()} and {@link Context#getCodeCacheDir()}, and
     * it also includes {@link Context#getExternalCacheDir()} if the primary
     * shared/external storage is hosted on the same storage device as your
     * private data.
     * <p class="note">
     * Note: if your app uses the {@code android:sharedUserId} manifest feature,
     * then cached data for all packages in your shared UID is tracked together
     * as a single unit.

     * @param storageUuid the UUID of the storage volume that you're interested
     *            in. The UUID for a specific path can be obtained using

     * @throws IOException when the storage device isn't present, or when it
     *             doesn't support cache quotas.
