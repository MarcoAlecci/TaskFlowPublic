         * Sets the signal strength. This is a signed integer, with higher values indicating a
         * stronger signal. The exact units are bearer-dependent. For example, Wi-Fi uses the same
         * RSSI units reported by WifiManager.
         * <p>
         * Note that when used to register a network callback, this specifies the minimum acceptable
         * signal strength. When received as the state of an existing network it specifies the
         * current value. A value of {@code SIGNAL_STRENGTH_UNSPECIFIED} means no value when
         * received and has no effect when requesting a callback.
         *
         * <p>This method requires the caller to hold the
         * {@link android.Manifest.permission#NETWORK_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_WAKEUP} permission

         * @param signalStrength the bearer-specific signal strength.
