     * Remove canonicalization from canonical URIs previously returned by
     * {@link #canonicalize}.  For example, if your implementation is to add
     * a query param to canonicalize a URI, this method can simply trip any
     * query params on the URI.  The default implementation always returns the
     * same <var>url</var> that was passed in.
     *
     * @param url The Uri to remove any canonicalization from.
     *
     * @return Return the non-canonical representation of <var>url</var>, return
     * the <var>url</var> as-is if there is nothing to do, or return null if
     * the data identified by the canonical representation can not be found in
     * the current environment.
