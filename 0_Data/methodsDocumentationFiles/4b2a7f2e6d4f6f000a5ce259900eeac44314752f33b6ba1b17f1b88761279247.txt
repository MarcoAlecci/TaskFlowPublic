     * Sets the temp file root for downloads.
     * All temp files created for the middleware to write to will be contained in the specified
     * directory. Applications that wish to specify a location only need to call this method once
     * as long their data is persisted in storage -- the argument will be stored both in a
     * local instance of {@link android.content.SharedPreferences} and by the middleware.
     *
     * If this method is not called at least once before calling
     * {@link #download(DownloadRequest)}, the framework
     * will default to a directory formed by the concatenation of the app's files directory and
     * {@link MbmsDownloadSession#DEFAULT_TOP_LEVEL_TEMP_DIRECTORY}.
     *
     * Before calling this method, the app must cancel all of its pending
     * {@link DownloadRequest}s via {@link #cancelDownload(DownloadRequest)}. If this is not done,
     * you will receive an asynchronous error with code
     * {@link MbmsErrors.DownloadErrors#ERROR_CANNOT_CHANGE_TEMP_FILE_ROOT} unless the
     * provided directory is the same as what has been previously configured.
     *
     * The {@link File} supplied as a root temp file directory must already exist. If not, an
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown. In addition, as an additional sanity
     * check, an {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown if you attempt to set the temp
     * file root directory to one of your data roots (the value of {@link Context#getDataDir()},
     * {@link Context#getFilesDir()}, or {@link Context#getCacheDir()}).
     * @param tempFileRootDirectory A directory to place temp files in.
