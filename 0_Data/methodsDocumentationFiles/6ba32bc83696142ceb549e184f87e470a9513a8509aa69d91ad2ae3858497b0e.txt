     * Set a {@link PageTransformer} that will be called for each attached page whenever
     * the scroll position is changed. This allows the application to apply custom property
     * transformations to each page, overriding the default sliding look and feel.
     *
     * <p><em>Note:</em> Prior to Android 3.0 the property animation APIs did not exist.
     * As a result, setting a PageTransformer prior to Android 3.0 (API 11) will have no effect.</p>
     *
     * @param reverseDrawingOrder true if the supplied PageTransformer requires page views
     *                            to be drawn from last to first instead of first to last.
     * @param transformer PageTransformer that will modify each page's animation properties
