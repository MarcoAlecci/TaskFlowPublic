     * Performs a bulk transaction on the given endpoint.
     * The direction of the transfer is determined by the direction of the endpoint.
     * <p>
     * This method transfers data starting from index 0 in the buffer.
     * To specify a different offset, use
     * {@link #bulkTransfer(UsbEndpoint, byte[], int, int, int)}.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param endpoint the endpoint for this transaction
     * @param buffer buffer for data to send or receive; can be {@code null} to wait for next
     *               transaction without reading data
     * @param length the length of the data to send or receive. Before
     *               {@value Build.VERSION_CODES#P}, a value larger than 16384 bytes
     *               would be truncated down to 16384. In API {@value Build.VERSION_CODES#P}
     *               and after, any value of length is valid.
     * @param timeout in milliseconds, 0 is infinite
     * @return length of data transferred (or zero) for success,
     * or negative value for failure
