     * Ensures the values in each field are in range. For example if the
     * current value of this calendar is March 32, normalize() will convert it
     * to April 1. It also fills in weekDay, yearDay, isDst and gmtoff.
     *
     * <p>
     * If "ignoreDst" is true, then this method sets the "isDst" field to -1
     * (the "unknown" value) before normalizing.  It then computes the
     * time in milliseconds and sets the correct value for "isDst" if the
     * fields resolve to a valid date / time.
     *
     * <p>
     * See {@link #toMillis(boolean)} for more information about when to
     * use <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> for "ignoreDst" and when {@code -1}
     * might be returned.
     *
     * @return the UTC milliseconds since the epoch, or {@code -1}
