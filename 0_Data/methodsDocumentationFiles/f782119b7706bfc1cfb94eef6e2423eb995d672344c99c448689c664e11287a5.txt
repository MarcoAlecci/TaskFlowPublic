     * Query Telephony to see if there has recently been an emergency SMS sent to the network by the
     * user and we are still within the time interval after the emergency SMS was sent that we are
     * considered in Emergency SMS mode.
     *
     * <p>This mode is used by other applications to allow them to perform special functionality,
     * such as allow the GNSS service to provide user location to the carrier network for emergency
     * when an emergency SMS is sent. This interval is set by
     * {@link CarrierConfigManager#KEY_EMERGENCY_SMS_MODE_TIMER_MS_INT}. If
     * the carrier does not support this mode, this function will always return false.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if this device is in emergency SMS mode, {@code false} otherwise.
