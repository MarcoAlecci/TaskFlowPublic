     * Request that the next incoming call from a number matching {@code range} be intercepted.
     *
     * This API is intended for OEMs to provide a service for apps to verify the device's phone
     * number. When called, the Telephony stack will store the provided {@link PhoneNumberRange} and
     * intercept the next incoming call from a number that lies within the range, within a timeout
     * specified by {@code timeoutMillis}.
     *
     * If such a phone call is received, the caller will be notified via
     * {@link NumberVerificationCallback#onCallReceived(String)} on the provided {@link Executor}.
     * If verification fails for any reason, the caller will be notified via
     * {@link NumberVerificationCallback#onVerificationFailed(int)}
     * on the provided {@link Executor}.
     *
     * In addition to the {@link Manifest.permission#MODIFY_PHONE_STATE} permission, callers of this
     * API must also be listed in the device configuration as an authorized app in
     * {@code packages/services/Telephony/res/values/config.xml} under the
     * {@code config_number_verification_package_name} key.
