     * Returns whether the ProgressBar is animating or not. This is essentially the same
     * as whether the ProgressBar is {@link #isIndeterminate() indeterminate} and visible,
     * as indeterminate ProgressBars are always animating, and non-indeterminate
     * ProgressBars are not animating.
     *
     * @return true if the ProgressBar is animating, false otherwise.
