     * Look up the values of multiple properties for a particular namespace. The lookup is atomic,
     * such that the values of these properties cannot change between the time when the first is
     * fetched and the time when the last is fetched.
     * <p>
     * Each call to {@link #setProperties(Properties)} is also atomic and ensures that either none
     * or all of the change is picked up here, but never only part of it.

     * @param namespace The namespace containing the properties to look up.
     * @param names     The names of properties to look up, or empty to fetch all properties for the
     *                  given namespace.
     * @return {@link Properties} object containing the requested properties. This reflects the
     *     state of these properties at the time of the lookup, and is not updated to reflect any
     *     future changes. The keyset of this Properties object will contain only the intersection
     *     of properties already set and properties requested via the names parameter. Properties
     *     that are already set but were not requested will not be contained here. Properties that
     *     are not set, but were requested will not be contained here either.
