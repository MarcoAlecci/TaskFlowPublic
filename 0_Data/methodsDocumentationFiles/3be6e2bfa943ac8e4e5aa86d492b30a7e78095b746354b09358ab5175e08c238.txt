         * throw an {@link IllegalStateException} if this builder was constructed without a
         * {@link RemoteViews presentation}. Android {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} and
         * higher removed this restriction because datasets used as an
         * {@link android.view.autofill.AutofillManager#EXTRA_AUTHENTICATION_RESULT
         * authentication result} do not need a presentation. But if you don't set the presentation
         * in the constructor in a dataset that is meant to be shown to the user, the autofill UI

         * <p><b>Note:</b> On Android {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} and

         *        but the target view is a logical part of the dataset. For example, if
