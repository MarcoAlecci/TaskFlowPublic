     * Like {@link #isVoiceInteraction}, but only returns {@code true} if this is also the root
     * of a voice interaction.  That is, returns {@code true} if this activity was directly
     * started by the voice interaction service as the initiation of a voice interaction.
     * Otherwise, for example if it was started by another activity while under voice
     * interaction, returns {@code false}.
     * If the activity {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity_launchMode launchMode} is
     * {@code singleTask}, it forces the activity to launch in a new task, separate from the one
     * that started it. Therefore, there is no longer a relationship between them, and
     * {@link #isVoiceInteractionRoot()} return {@code false} in this case.
