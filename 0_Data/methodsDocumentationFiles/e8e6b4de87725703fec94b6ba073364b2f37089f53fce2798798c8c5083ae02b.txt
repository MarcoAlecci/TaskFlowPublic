     * Build URI representing the target {@link Document#COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID} in
     * a document provider. When queried, a provider will return a single row
     * with columns defined by {@link Document}.
     * <p>
     * However, instead of directly accessing the target document, the returned
     * URI will leverage access granted through a subtree URI, typically
     * returned by {@link Intent#ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE}. The target document
     * must be a descendant (child, grandchild, etc) of the subtree.
     * <p>
     * This is typically used to access documents under a user-selected
     * directory tree, since it doesn't require the user to separately confirm
     * each new document access.
     *
     * @param treeUri the subtree to leverage to gain access to the target
     *            document. The target directory must be a descendant of this
     *            subtree.
     * @param documentId the target document, which the caller may not have
     *            direct access to.
