     * Writes a trace message to indicate that a given section of code has begun. This call must
     * be followed by a corresponding call to {@link #endSection()} on the same thread.
     *
     * <p class="note"> At this time the vertical bar character '|', newline character '\n', and
     * null character '\0' are used internally by the tracing mechanism.  If sectionName contains
     * these characters they will be replaced with a space character in the trace.
     *
     * @param sectionName The name of the code section to appear in the trace.  This may be at
     * most 127 Unicode code units long.
