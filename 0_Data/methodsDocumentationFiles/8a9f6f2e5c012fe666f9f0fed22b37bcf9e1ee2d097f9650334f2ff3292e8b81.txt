     * visible, {@link #onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)} will be called at some
     * point in the future.
     * <p>
     * This must be called from a UI thread. To call from a non-UI thread, call
     * {@link #postInvalidate()}.

     * <b>WARNING:</b> In API 19 and below, this method may be destructive to

     * @param dirty the rectangle representing the bounds of the dirty region
     *
     * @deprecated The switch to hardware accelerated rendering in API 14 reduced
     * the importance of the dirty rectangle. In API 21 the given rectangle is
     * ignored entirely in favor of an internally-calculated area instead.
     * Because of this, clients are encouraged to just call {@link #invalidate()}.
