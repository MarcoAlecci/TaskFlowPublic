     * Returns whether cleartext network traffic (e.g. HTTP, FTP, WebSockets, XMPP, IMAP, SMTP --
     * without TLS or STARTTLS) is permitted for all network communication from this process.
     *
     * <p>When cleartext network traffic is not permitted, the platform's components (e.g. HTTP and
     * FTP stacks, {@link android.app.DownloadManager}, {@link android.media.MediaPlayer}) will
     * refuse this process's requests to use cleartext traffic. Third-party libraries are strongly
     * encouraged to honor this setting as well.
     *
     * <p>This flag is honored on a best effort basis because it's impossible to prevent all
     * cleartext traffic from Android applications given the level of access provided to them. For
     * example, there's no expectation that the {@link java.net.Socket} API will honor this flag
     * because it cannot determine whether its traffic is in cleartext. However, most network
     * traffic from applications is handled by higher-level network stacks/components which can
     * honor this aspect of the policy.
     *
     * <p>NOTE: {@link android.webkit.WebView} honors this flag for applications targeting API level
     * 26 and up.
