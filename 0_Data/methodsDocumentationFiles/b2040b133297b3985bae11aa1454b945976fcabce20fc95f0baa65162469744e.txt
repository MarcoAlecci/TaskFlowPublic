     * Given a legacy type (TYPE_WIFI, ...) returns a NetworkCapabilities
     * instance suitable for registering a request or callback.  Throws an
     * IllegalArgumentException if no mapping from the legacy type to
     * NetworkCapabilities is known.
     *
     * @deprecated Types are deprecated. Use {@link NetworkCallback} or {@link NetworkRequest}
     *     to find the network instead.
