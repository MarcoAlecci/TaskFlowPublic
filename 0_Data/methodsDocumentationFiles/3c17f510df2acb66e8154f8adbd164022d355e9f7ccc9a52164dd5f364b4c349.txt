     * Returns absolute paths to application-specific directories on all
     * shared/external storage devices where the application can place media
     * files. These files are scanned and made available to other apps through
     * {@link MediaStore}.
     * <p>
     * This is like {@link #getExternalFilesDirs} in that these files will be
     * deleted when the application is uninstalled, however there are some
     * important differences:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Shared storage may not always be available, since removable media can
     * be ejected by the user. Media state can be checked using
     * {@link Environment#getExternalStorageState(File)}.
     * <li>There is no security enforced with these files. For example, any
     * application holding
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} can write to
     * these files.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Shared storage devices returned here are considered a stable part of the
     * device, including physical media slots under a protective cover. The
     * returned paths do not include transient devices, such as USB flash drives
     * connected to handheld devices.
     * <p>
     * An application may store data on any or all of the returned devices. For
     * example, an app may choose to store large files on the device with the
     * most available space, as measured by {@link StatFs}.
     * <p>
     * No additional permissions are required for the calling app to read or
     * write files under the returned path. Write access outside of these paths
     * on secondary external storage devices is not available.
     * <p>
     * The returned paths may change over time if different shared storage media
     * is inserted, so only relative paths should be persisted.
     *
     * @return the absolute paths to application-specific directories. Some
     *         individual paths may be {@code null} if that shared storage is
     *         not currently available.
     * @see Environment#getExternalStorageState(File)
     * @see Environment#isExternalStorageEmulated(File)
     * @see Environment#isExternalStorageRemovable(File)
     * @deprecated These directories still exist and are scanned, but developers
     *             are encouraged to migrate to inserting content into a
     *             {@link MediaStore} collection directly, as any app can
     *             contribute new media to {@link MediaStore} with no
     *             permissions required, starting in
     *             {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}.
