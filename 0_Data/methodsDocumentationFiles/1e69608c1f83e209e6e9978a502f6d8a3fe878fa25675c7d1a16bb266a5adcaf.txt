     * Returns a "good" intent to launch a front-door activity in a package.
     * This is used, for example, to implement an "open" button when browsing
     * through packages.  The current implementation looks first for a main
     * activity in the category {@link Intent#CATEGORY_INFO}, and next for a
     * main activity in the category {@link Intent#CATEGORY_LAUNCHER}. Returns
     * <code>null</code> if neither are found.
     *
     * @param packageName The name of the package to inspect.
     *
     * @return A fully-qualified {@link Intent} that can be used to launch the
     * main activity in the package. Returns <code>null</code> if the package
     * does not contain such an activity, or if <em>packageName</em> is not
     * recognized.
