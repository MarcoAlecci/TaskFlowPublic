     * <p>
     * A content description briefly describes the view and is primarily used
     * for accessibility support to determine how a view should be presented to
     * the user. In the case of a view with no textual representation, such as
     * {@link android.widget.ImageButton}, a useful content description
     * explains what the view does. For example, an image button with a phone
     * icon that is used to place a call may use "Call" as its content
     * description. An image of a floppy disk that is used to save a file may
     * use "Save".
