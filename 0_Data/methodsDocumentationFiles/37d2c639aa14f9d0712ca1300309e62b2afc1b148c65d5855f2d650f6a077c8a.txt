         * Get the list of inputs to be collected from the user that ONLY accept data when this
         * action is sent. These remote inputs are guaranteed to return true on a call to
         * {@link RemoteInput#isDataOnly}.
         *
         * Returns null if there are no data-only remote inputs.
         *
         * This method exists so that legacy RemoteInput collectors that pre-date the addition
         * of non-textual RemoteInputs do not access these remote inputs.
