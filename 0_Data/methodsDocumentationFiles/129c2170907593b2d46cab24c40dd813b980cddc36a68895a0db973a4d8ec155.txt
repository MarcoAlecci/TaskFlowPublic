         * Sets the {@link AudioAttributes} to be associated with the focus request, and which
         * describe the use case for which focus is requested.
         * As the focus requests typically precede audio playback, this information is used on
         * certain platforms to declare the subsequent playback use case. It is therefore good
         * practice to use in this method the same {@code AudioAttributes} as used for
         * playback, see for example {@link MediaPlayer#setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)} in
         * {@code MediaPlayer} or {@link AudioTrack.Builder#setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)}
         * in {@code AudioTrack}.
         * @param attributes the {@link AudioAttributes} for the focus request.
         * @return this {@code Builder} instance.
         * @throws NullPointerException thrown when using null for the attributes.
