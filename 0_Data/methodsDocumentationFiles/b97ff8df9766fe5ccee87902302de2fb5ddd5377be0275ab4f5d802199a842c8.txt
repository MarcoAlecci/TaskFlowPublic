     * Captures the values in the start scene for the properties that this
     * transition monitors. These values are then passed as the startValues
     * structure in a later call to
     * {@link #createAnimator(ViewGroup, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}.
     * The main concern for an implementation is what the
     * properties are that the transition cares about and what the values are
     * for all of those properties. The start and end values will be compared
     * later during the
     * {@link #createAnimator(android.view.ViewGroup, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}
     * method to determine what, if any, animations, should be run.
     *
     * <p>Subclasses must implement this method. The method should only be called by the
     * transition system; it is not intended to be called from external classes.</p>
     *
     * @param transitionValues The holder for any values that the Transition
     * wishes to store. Values are stored in the <code>values</code> field
     * of this TransitionValues object and are keyed from
     * a String value. For example, to store a view's rotation value,
     * a transition might call
     * <code>transitionValues.values.put("appname:transitionname:rotation",
     * view.getRotation())</code>. The target view will already be stored in
     * the transitionValues structure when this method is called.
