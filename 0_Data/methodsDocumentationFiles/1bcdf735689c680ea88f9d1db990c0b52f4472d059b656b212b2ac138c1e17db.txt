     * Notifies the MMTel feature that you would like to start a session. This should always be
     * done before making/receiving IMS calls. The IMS service will register the device to the
     * operator's network with the credentials (from ISIM) periodically in order to receive calls
     * from the operator's network. When the IMS service receives a new call, it will send out an
     * intent with the provided action string. The intent contains a call ID extra
     * {@link IImsCallSession#getCallId} and it can be used to take a call.
     *
     * @param incomingCallIntent When an incoming call is received, the IMS service will call
     * {@link PendingIntent#send} to send back the intent to the caller with
     * ImsManager#INCOMING_CALL_RESULT_CODE as the result code and the intent to fill in the call
     * ID; It cannot be null.
     * @param listener To listen to IMS registration events; It cannot be null
     * @return an integer (greater than 0) representing the session id associated with the session
     * that has been started.
