     * Sets the next output file descriptor to be used when the maximum filesize is reached
     * on the prior output {@link #setOutputFile} or {@link #setNextOutputFile}). File descriptor
     * must be seekable and writable. After setting the next output file, application should not
     * use the file referenced by this file descriptor until {@link #stop}. It is the application's
     * responsibility to close the file descriptor. It is safe to do so as soon as this call returns.
     * Application must call this after receiving on the
     * {@link android.media.MediaRecorder.OnInfoListener} a "what" code of
     * {@link #MEDIA_RECORDER_INFO_MAX_FILESIZE_APPROACHING} and before receiving a "what" code of
     * {@link #MEDIA_RECORDER_INFO_MAX_FILESIZE_REACHED}. The file is not used until switching to
     * that output. Application will receive{@link #MEDIA_RECORDER_INFO_NEXT_OUTPUT_FILE_STARTED}
     * when the next output file is used. Application will not be able to set a new output file if
     * the previous one has not been used. Application is responsible for cleaning up unused files
     * after {@link #stop} is called.
