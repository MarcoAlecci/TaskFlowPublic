     * Calculates the minimum alpha value which can be applied to {@code background} so that would
     * have a contrast value of at least {@code minContrastRatio} when alpha blended to
     * {@code foreground}.
     *
     * @param foreground       the foreground color
     * @param background       the background color, opacity will be ignored
     * @param minContrastRatio the minimum contrast ratio
     * @return the alpha value in the range 0-255, or -1 if no value could be calculated
