         * Sends an accessibility event. This method behaves exactly as
         * {@link #sendAccessibilityEvent(View, int)} but takes as an argument an
         * empty {@link AccessibilityEvent} and does not perform a check whether
         * accessibility is enabled.
         * <p>
         * The default implementation behaves as
         * {@link View#sendAccessibilityEventUnchecked(AccessibilityEvent)
         *  View#sendAccessibilityEventUnchecked(AccessibilityEvent)} for
         * the case of no accessibility delegate been set.
         * </p>
         *
         * @param host The View hosting the delegate.
         * @param event The event to send.
