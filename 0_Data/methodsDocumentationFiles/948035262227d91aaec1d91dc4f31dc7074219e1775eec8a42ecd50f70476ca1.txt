     * If fillBefore is true, this animation will apply its transformation
     * before the start time of the animation. Defaults to true if
     * {@link #setFillEnabled(boolean)} is not set to true.
     * Note that this applies when using an {@link
     * android.view.animation.AnimationSet AnimationSet} to chain
     * animations. The transformation is not applied before the AnimationSet
     * itself starts.
     *
     * @param fillBefore true if the animation should apply its transformation before it starts
