     * Return the "credential encrypted" system directory for a user. This is
     * for use by system services to store files relating to the user. This
     * directory supports fast user wipe, and will be automatically deleted when
     * the user is removed.
     * <p>
     * Data stored under this path is "credential encrypted", which uses an
     * encryption key that is entangled with user credentials, such as a PIN or
     * password. The contents will only be available once the user has been
     * unlocked, as reported by {@code SystemService.onUnlockUser()}.
     * <p>
     * New code should <em>strongly</em> prefer storing sensitive data in these
     * credential encrypted areas.
