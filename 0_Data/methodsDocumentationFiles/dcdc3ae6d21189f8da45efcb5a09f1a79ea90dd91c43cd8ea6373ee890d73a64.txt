     * Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name
     * using the specified format. Valid values for the format are
     * "RFC1779", "RFC2253", and "CANONICAL" (case insensitive).
     *
     * <p> If "RFC1779" is specified as the format,
     * this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
     * RFC 1779 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET).
     * Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.
     *
     * <p> If "RFC2253" is specified as the format,
     * this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
     * RFC 2253 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET, DC, UID).
     * Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.
     * Under a strict reading, RFC 2253 only specifies a UTF-8 string
     * representation. The String returned by this method is the
     * Unicode string achieved by decoding this UTF-8 representation.
     *
     * <p> If "CANONICAL" is specified as the format,
     * this method returns an RFC 2253 conformant string representation
     * with the following additional canonicalizations:
     *
     * <ol>
     * <li> Leading zeros are removed from attribute types
     *          that are encoded as dotted decimal OIDs
     * <li> DirectoryString attribute values of type
     *          PrintableString and UTF8String are not
     *          output in hexadecimal format
     * <li> DirectoryString attribute values of types
     *          other than PrintableString and UTF8String
     *          are output in hexadecimal format
     * <li> Leading and trailing white space characters
     *          are removed from non-hexadecimal attribute values
     *          (unless the value consists entirely of white space characters)
     * <li> Internal substrings of one or more white space characters are
     *          converted to a single space in non-hexadecimal
     *          attribute values
     * <li> Relative Distinguished Names containing more than one
     *          Attribute Value Assertion (AVA) are output in the
     *          following order: an alphabetical ordering of AVAs
     *          containing standard keywords, followed by a numeric
     *          ordering of AVAs containing OID keywords.
     * <li> The only characters in attribute values that are escaped are
     *          those which section 2.4 of RFC 2253 states must be escaped
     *          (they are escaped using a preceding backslash character)
     * <li> The entire name is converted to upper case
     *          using {@code String.toUpperCase(Locale.US)}
     * <li> The entire name is converted to lower case
     *          using {@code String.toLowerCase(Locale.US)}
     * <li> The name is finally normalized using normalization form KD,
     *          as described in the Unicode Standard and UAX #15
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p> Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future.
