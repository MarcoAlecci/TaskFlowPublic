     * Called by a profile owner of an organization-owned managed profile to set maximum time
     * the profile is allowed to be turned off. If the profile is turned off for longer, personal
     * apps are suspended on the device.
     *
     * <p>When personal apps are suspended, an ongoing notification about that is shown to the user.
     * When the user taps the notification, system invokes {@link #ACTION_CHECK_POLICY_COMPLIANCE}
     * in the profile owner package. Profile owner implementation that uses personal apps suspension
     * must handle this intent.

     * @param timeoutMillis Maximum time the profile is allowed to be off in milliseconds or 0 if
     *        not limited. The minimum non-zero value corresponds to 72 hours. If an admin sets a
     *        smaller non-zero vaulue, 72 hours will be set instead.
