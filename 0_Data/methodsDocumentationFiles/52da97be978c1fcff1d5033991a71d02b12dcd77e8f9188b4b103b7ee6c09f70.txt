     * Compares this buffer to another.
     *
     * <p> Two byte buffers are compared by comparing their sequences of
     * remaining elements lexicographically, without regard to the starting
     * position of each sequence within its corresponding buffer.
     *

     *
     *
     * Pairs of {@code byte} elements are compared as if by invoking
     * {@link Byte#compare(byte,byte)}.

     *
     * <p> A byte buffer is not comparable to any other type of object.
     *
     * @return  A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this buffer
     *          is less than, equal to, or greater than the given buffer
