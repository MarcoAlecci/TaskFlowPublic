     * Called by a profile owner of an organization-owned managed profile to suspend personal
     * apps on the device. When personal apps are suspended the device can only be used for calls.
     *
     * <p>When personal apps are suspended, an ongoing notification about that is shown to the user.
     * When the user taps the notification, system invokes {@link #ACTION_CHECK_POLICY_COMPLIANCE}
     * in the profile owner package. Profile owner implementation that uses personal apps suspension
     * must handle this intent.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with
     * @param suspended Whether personal apps should be suspended.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the profile owner doesn't have an activity that handles
     *        {@link #ACTION_CHECK_POLICY_COMPLIANCE}
