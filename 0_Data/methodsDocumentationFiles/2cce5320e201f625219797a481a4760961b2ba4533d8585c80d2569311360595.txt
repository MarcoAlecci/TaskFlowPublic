     * Set the system identifier for this input source.
     *
     * <p>The system identifier is optional if there is a byte stream
     * or a character stream, but it is still useful to provide one,
     * since the application can use it to resolve relative URIs
     * and can include it in error messages and warnings (the parser
     * will attempt to open a connection to the URI only if
     * there is no byte stream or character stream specified).</p>
     *
     * <p>If the application knows the character encoding of the
     * object pointed to by the system identifier, it can register
     * the encoding using the setEncoding method.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the system identifier is a URL, it must be fully
     * resolved (it may not be a relative URL).</p>
     *
     * @param systemId The system identifier as a string.
