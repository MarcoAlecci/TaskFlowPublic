     * Set up an app's code path. The expected outcome of this method is:
     * 1) The actual apk directory under /data/incremental is bind-mounted to the parent directory
     * of {@code afterCodeFile}.
     * 2) All the files under {@code beforeCodeFile} will show up under {@code afterCodeFile}.
     *
     * @param beforeCodeFile Path that is currently bind-mounted and have APKs under it.
     *                       Should no longer have any APKs after this method is called.
     *                       Example: /data/app/vmdl*tmp
     * @param afterCodeFile Path that should will have APKs after this method is called. Its parent
     *                      directory should be bind-mounted to a directory under /data/incremental.
     *                      Example: /data/app/~~[randomStringA]/[packageName]-[randomStringB]
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     * @throws IOException
     * TODO(b/147371381): add unit tests
