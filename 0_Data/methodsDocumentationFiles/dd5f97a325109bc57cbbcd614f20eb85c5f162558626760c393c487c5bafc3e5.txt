     * Iconifies or expands the SearchView. Any query text is cleared when iconified. This is
     * a temporary state and does not override the default iconified state set by
     * {@link #setIconifiedByDefault(boolean)}. If the default state is iconified, then
     * a false here will only be valid until the user closes the field. And if the default
     * state is expanded, then a true here will only clear the text field and not close it.
     *
     * @param iconify a true value will collapse the SearchView to an icon, while a false will
     * expand it.
