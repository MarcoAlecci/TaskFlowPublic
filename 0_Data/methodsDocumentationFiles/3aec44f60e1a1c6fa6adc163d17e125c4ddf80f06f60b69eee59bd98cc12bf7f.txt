     * Instructs Telecom to continue playing a post-dial DTMF string.
     *
     * A post-dial DTMF string is a string of digits entered after a phone number, when dialed,
     * that are immediately sent as DTMF tones to the recipient as soon as the connection is made.
     * While these tones are playing, Telecom will notify the {@link InCallService} that the call
     * is in the post dial state.
     *
     * If the DTMF string contains a {@link TelecomManager#DTMF_CHARACTER_PAUSE} symbol, Telecom
     * will temporarily pause playing the tones for a pre-defined period of time.
     *
     * If the DTMF string contains a {@link TelecomManager#DTMF_CHARACTER_WAIT} symbol, Telecom
     * will pause playing the tones and notify the {@link InCallService} that the call is in the
     * post dial wait state. When the user decides to continue the postdial sequence, the
     * {@link InCallService} should invoke the {@link #postDialContinue(String,boolean)} method.
     *
     * @param callId The unique ID of the call for which postdial string playing should continue.
     * @param proceed Whether or not to continue with the post-dial sequence.
