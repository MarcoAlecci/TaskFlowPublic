     * Write an entire file as part of a full-backup operation.  The file's contents
     * will be delivered to the backup destination along with the metadata necessary
     * to place it with the proper location and permissions on the device where the
     * data is restored.
     *
     * <p class="note">Attempting to back up files in directories that are ignored by
     * the backup system will have no effect.  For example, if the app calls this method
     * with a file inside the {@link #getNoBackupFilesDir()} directory, it will be ignored.
     * See {@link #onFullBackup(FullBackupDataOutput)} for details on what directories
     * are excluded from backups.
     *
     * @param file The file to be backed up.  The file must exist and be readable by
     *     the caller.
     * @param output The destination to which the backed-up file data will be sent.
