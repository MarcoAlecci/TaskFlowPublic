     * Called to do initial creation of a fragment.  This is called after
     * {@link #onAttach(Activity)} and before
     * {@link #onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle)}, but is not called if the fragment
     * instance is retained across Activity re-creation (see {@link #setRetainInstance(boolean)}).
     *
     * <p>Note that this can be called while the fragment's activity is
     * still in the process of being created.  As such, you can not rely
     * on things like the activity's content view hierarchy being initialized
     * at this point.  If you want to do work once the activity itself is
     * created, see {@link #onActivityCreated(Bundle)}.
     *
     * <p>If your app's <code>targetSdkVersion</code> is {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M}
     * or lower, child fragments being restored from the savedInstanceState are restored after
     * <code>onCreate</code> returns. When targeting {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N} or
     * above and running on an N or newer platform version
     * they are restored by <code>Fragment.onCreate</code>.</p>
     *
     * @param savedInstanceState If the fragment is being re-created from
     * a previous saved state, this is the state.
