         * Value of an identifier.
         *
         * Its meaning depends on identifier type, ie. for IDENTIFIER_TYPE_AMFM_FREQUENCY type,
         * the value is a frequency in kHz.
         *
         * The range of a value depends on its type; it does not always require the whole long
         * range. Casting to necessary type (ie. int) without range checking is correct in front-end
         * code - any range violations are either errors in the framework or in the
         * HAL implementation. For example, IDENTIFIER_TYPE_AMFM_FREQUENCY always fits in int,
         * as Integer.MAX_VALUE would mean 2.1THz.
         *
         * @return value of an identifier.
