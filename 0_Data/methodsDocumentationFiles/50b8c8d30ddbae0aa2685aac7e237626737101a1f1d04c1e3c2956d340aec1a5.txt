     * Deletes the component at the specified index. Each component in
     * this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified
     * {@code index} is shifted downward to have an index one
     * smaller than the value it had previously. The size of this vector
     * is decreased by {@code 1}.
     *
     * <p>The index must be a value greater than or equal to {@code 0}
     * and less than the current size of the vector.
     *
     * <p>This method is identical in functionality to the {@link #remove(int)}
     * method (which is part of the {@link List} interface).  Note that the
     * {@code remove} method returns the old value that was stored at the
     * specified position.
     *
     * @param      index   the index of the object to remove
     * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range
     *         ({@code index < 0 || index >= size()})
