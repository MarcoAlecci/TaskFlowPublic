     * Check whether we need to draw a default focus highlight when this view gets focused,
     * which requires:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>In both background and foreground, {@link android.R.attr#state_focused}
     *         is not defined.</li>
     *     <li>This view is not in touch mode.</li>
     *     <li>This view doesn't opt out for a default focus highlight, via
     *         {@link #setDefaultFocusHighlightEnabled(boolean)}.</li>
     *     <li>This view is attached to window.</li>
     * </ul>
     * @return {@code true} if a default focus highlight is needed.
     * @hide
