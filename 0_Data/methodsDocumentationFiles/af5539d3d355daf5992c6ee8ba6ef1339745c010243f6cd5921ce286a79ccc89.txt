     * Convenience for {@link #saveLayer(RectF, Paint)} but instead of taking a entire Paint object
     * it takes only the {@code alpha} parameter.
     *
     * @param bounds    The maximum size the offscreen bitmap needs to be
     *                  (in local coordinates)
     * @param alpha     The alpha to apply to the offscreen when it is
                        drawn during restore()
