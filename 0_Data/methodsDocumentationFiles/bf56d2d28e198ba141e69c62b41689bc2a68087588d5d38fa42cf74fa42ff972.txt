     * Check whether an application is visible for a role.
     *
     * While an application can be qualified for a role, it can still stay hidden from user (thus
     * not visible). If an application is visible for a role, we may show things related to the role
     * for it, e.g. showing an entry pointing to the role settings in its application info page.
     *
     * @param roleName name of the role to check for
     * @param packageName package name of the application to check for
     *
     * @return whether the application is visible for the role
