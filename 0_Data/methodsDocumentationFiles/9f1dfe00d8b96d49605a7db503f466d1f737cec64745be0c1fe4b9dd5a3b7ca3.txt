     * <p>Security managers do <i>not</i> provide a secure environment for
     * executing untrusted code and are unsupported on Android. Untrusted code
     * cannot be safely isolated within a single VM on Android, so this method
     * <i>always</i> throws a {@code SecurityException} when passed a non-null SecurityManager
     *
     * @param s a security manager
     * @throws SecurityException always, unless {@code sm == null}
