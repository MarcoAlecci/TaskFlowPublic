     *
     * @param st The panel to be closed.
     * @param doCallback Whether to notify the callback that the panel was
     *            closed. If the panel is in the process of re-opening or
     *            opening another panel (e.g., menu opening a sub menu), the
     *            callback should not happen and this variable should be false.
     *            In addition, this method internally will only perform the
     *            callback if the panel is open.
