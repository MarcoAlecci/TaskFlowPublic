     * Notify of bcast/unicast method being used.
     *
     * This is intended to be informational.  Indicates
     * whether we're able to use cell broadcast or have
     * had to fallback to unicast for this stream.
     *
     * This must be called once at the beginning of the stream
     * around the same time as we change to STATE_STARTED, but
     * strict ordering is not specified.  It must be called
     * again if we change modes, but if that doesn't happen
     * the callback won't be used again.
     *
     * See {@link StreamingService#BROADCAST_METHOD} and
     * {@link StreamingService#UNICAST_METHOD}
