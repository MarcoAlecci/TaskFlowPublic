     * Returns an {@link OnTouchListener} that can be added to the anchor view
     * to implement drag-to-open behavior.
     * <p>
     * When the listener is set on a view, touching that view and dragging
     * outside of its bounds will open the popup window. Lifting will select
     * the currently touched list item.
     * <p>
     * Example usage:
     * <pre>
     * PopupMenu myPopup = new PopupMenu(context, myAnchor);
     * myAnchor.setOnTouchListener(myPopup.getDragToOpenListener());
     * </pre>
     *
     * @return a touch listener that controls drag-to-open behavior
