     * Create a wrapped instance of the given {@link Cursor} which redacts the
     * requested columns so they always return specific values when accessed.
     * <p>
     * If a redacted column appears multiple times in the underlying cursor, all
     * instances will be redacted. If none of the redacted columns appear in the
     * given cursor, the given cursor will be returned untouched to improve
     * performance.
