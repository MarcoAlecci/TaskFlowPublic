     * <p>Calling with a {@code null} value for the set disables the restriction so that all
     * packages are allowed to access cross-profile calendar APIs. Calling with an empty set
     * disallows all packages from accessing cross-profile calendar APIs. If this method isn't
     * called, no package is allowed to access cross-profile calendar APIs by default.
