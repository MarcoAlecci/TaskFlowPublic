     * that there is no epicenter in the Transition and onGetEpicenter() will return null.
     * Transitions like {@link android.transition.Explode} use a point or Rect to orient
     * the direction of travel. This is called the epicenter of the Transition and is
     * typically centered on a touched View. The
     * {@link android.transition.Transition.EpicenterCallback} allows a Transition to
     * dynamically retrieve the epicenter during a Transition.
     * @param epicenterCallback The callback to use to find the epicenter of the Transition.
