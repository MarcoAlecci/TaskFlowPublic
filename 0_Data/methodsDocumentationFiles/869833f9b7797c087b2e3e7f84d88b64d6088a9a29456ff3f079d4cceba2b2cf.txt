             * Detect when an {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteCursor} or other SQLite object is
             * finalized without having been closed.
             *
             * <p>You always want to explicitly close your SQLite cursors to avoid unnecessary
             * database contention and temporary memory leaks.
