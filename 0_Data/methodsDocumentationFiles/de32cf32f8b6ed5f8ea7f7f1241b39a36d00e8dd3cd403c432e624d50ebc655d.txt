     * Return the raw data associated with a particular resource ID.
     * See getIdentifier() for information on how names are mapped to resource
     * IDs, and getString(int) for information on how string resources are
     * retrieved.
     * 
     * <p>Note: use of this function is discouraged.  It is much more
     * efficient to retrieve resources by identifier than by name.
     * 
     * @param name The name of the desired resource.  This is passed to
     *             getIdentifier() with a default type of "string".
     * @param outValue Object in which to place the resource data.
     * @param resolveRefs If true, a resource that is a reference to another
     *                    resource will be followed so that you receive the
     *                    actual final resource data.  If false, the TypedValue
     *                    will be filled in with the reference itself.
     *
     * @throws NotFoundException Throws NotFoundException if the given ID does not exist.
