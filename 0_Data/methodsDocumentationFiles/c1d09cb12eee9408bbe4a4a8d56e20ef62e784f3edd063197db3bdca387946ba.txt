     * Change the current system wallpaper to a specific byte stream, specifying a
     * hint about which subrectangle of the full image is to be visible.  The OS will
     * then try to best present the given portion of the full image as the static system
     * wallpaper image.  The data from the given InputStream is copied into persistent
     * storage and will then be used as the system wallpaper.  Currently the data must
     * be either a JPEG or PNG image.  On success, the intent
     * {@link Intent#ACTION_WALLPAPER_CHANGED} is broadcast.

     * @param bitmapData A stream containing the raw data to install as a wallpaper.  This
     *     data can be in any format handled by {@link BitmapRegionDecoder}.
     * @param visibleCropHint The rectangular subregion of the streamed image that should be
     *     displayed as wallpaper.  Passing {@code null} for this parameter means that
     *     the full image should be displayed if possible given the image's and device's
     *     aspect ratios, etc.
     * @param allowBackup {@code true} if the OS is permitted to back up this wallpaper
     *     image for restore to a future device; {@code false} otherwise.
     * @return An integer ID assigned to the newly active wallpaper; or zero on failure.

     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the {@code visibleCropHint} rectangle is
     *     empty or invalid.
