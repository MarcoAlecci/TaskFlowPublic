     * Add a cubic bezier from the last point, approaching control points
     * (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), and ending at (x3,y3). If no moveTo() call has been
     * made for this contour, the first point is automatically set to (0,0).
     *
     * @param x1 The x-coordinate of the 1st control point on a cubic curve
     * @param y1 The y-coordinate of the 1st control point on a cubic curve
     * @param x2 The x-coordinate of the 2nd control point on a cubic curve
     * @param y2 The y-coordinate of the 2nd control point on a cubic curve
     * @param x3 The x-coordinate of the end point on a cubic curve
     * @param y3 The y-coordinate of the end point on a cubic curve
