     * Dispatch a key event before it is processed by any input method
     * associated with the view hierarchy.  This can be used to intercept
     * key events in special situations before the IME consumes them; a
     * typical example would be handling the BACK key to update the application's
     * UI instead of allowing the IME to see it and close itself.
     *
     * @param event The key event to be dispatched.
     * @return True if the event was handled, false otherwise.
