     * settings and the current ringer mode.
     * <p>
     * This shouldn't be needed by most clients that use notifications to
     * vibrate. The notification manager will not vibrate if the policy doesn't
     * allow it, so the client should always set a vibrate pattern and let the
     * notification manager control whether or not to actually vibrate.
