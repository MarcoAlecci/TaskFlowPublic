             * Sets whether ringing should be silenced for the incoming call.  When set
             * to {@code true}, the Telecom framework will not play a ringtone for the call.
             * The call will, however, still be sent to the default dialer app if it is not blocked.
             * A {@link CallScreeningService} can use this to ensure a potential nuisance call is
             * still surfaced to the user, but in a less intrusive manner.
             *
             * Setting this to true only makes sense when the call has not been disallowed
             * using {@link #setDisallowCall(boolean)}.
