            ComponentName[], ComponentName)}, but with a specific userId to apply the preference
            to.

     * @deprecated This function no longer does anything. It is the platform's
     * responsibility to assign preferred activities and this cannot be modified
     * directly. To determine the activities resolved by the platform, use
     * {@link #resolveActivity} or {@link #queryIntentActivities}. To configure
     * an app to be responsible for a particular role and to check current role
     * holders, see {@link android.app.role.RoleManager}.
