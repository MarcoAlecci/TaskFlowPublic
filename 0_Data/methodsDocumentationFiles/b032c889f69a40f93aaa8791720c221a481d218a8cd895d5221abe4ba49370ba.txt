     * when a conference call becomes active on this connection.

     * This time is used to establish the duration of a call.  It uses
     * {@link SystemClock#elapsedRealtime()} to ensure that the call duration is not impacted by
     * time zone changes during a call.  The difference between the current
     * {@link SystemClock#elapsedRealtime()} and the value set at the connection start time is used
     * to populate {@link android.provider.CallLog.Calls#DURATION} in the call log.
