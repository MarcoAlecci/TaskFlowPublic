     * Create two ParcelFileDescriptors structured as a data pipe. The first
     * ParcelFileDescriptor in the returned array is the read side; the second
     * is the write side.
     * <p>
     * The write end has the ability to deliver an error message through
     * {@link #closeWithError(String)} which can be handled by the read end
     * calling {@link #checkError()}, usually after detecting an EOF.
     * This can also be used to detect remote crashes.
