     * Request that the renderer render a frame.
     * This method is typically used when the render mode has been set to
     * {@link #RENDERMODE_WHEN_DIRTY}, so that frames are only rendered on demand.
     * May be called
     * from any thread. Must not be called before a renderer has been set.
