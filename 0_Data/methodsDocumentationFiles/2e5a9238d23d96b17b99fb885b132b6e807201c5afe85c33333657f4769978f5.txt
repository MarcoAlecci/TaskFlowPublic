     * Normalize and set the data this intent is operating on.
     *
     * <p>This method automatically clears any type that was
     * previously set (for example, by {@link #setType}).
     *
     * <p>The data Uri is normalized using
     * {@link android.net.Uri#normalizeScheme} before it is set,
     * so really this is just a convenience method for
     * <pre>
     * setData(data.normalize())
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param data The Uri of the data this intent is now targeting.
     *
     * @return Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls
     * into a single statement.
