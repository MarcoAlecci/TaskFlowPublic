     * Performs a selection of the next Applet on this channel that matches to the partial AID
     * specified in the openBasicChannel(byte[] aid) or openLogicalChannel(byte[] aid) method.
     * This mechanism can be used by a device application to iterate through all Applets
     * matching to the same partial AID.
     * If selectNext() returns true a new Applet was successfully selected on this channel.
     * If no further Applet exists with matches to the partial AID this method returns false
     * and the already selected Applet stays selected. <br>
     *
     * Since the API cannot distinguish between a partial and full AID the API shall rely on the
     * response of the Secure Element for the return value of this method. <br>
     * The implementation of the underlying SELECT command within this method shall use
     * the same values as the corresponding openBasicChannel(byte[] aid) or
     * openLogicalChannel(byte[] aid) command with the option: <br>
     * P2='02' (Next occurrence) <br>
     * The select response stored in the Channel object shall be updated with the APDU
     * response of the SELECT command.

     * @return <code>true</code> if new Applet was selected on this channel.
               <code>false</code> he already selected Applet stays selected on this channel.
     *
     * @throws IOException if there is a communication problem to the reader or the Secure Element.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the channel is used after being closed.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this operation is not supported by the card.
