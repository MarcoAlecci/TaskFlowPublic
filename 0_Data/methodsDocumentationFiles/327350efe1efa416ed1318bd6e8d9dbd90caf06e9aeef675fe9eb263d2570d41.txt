     * Create two ParcelFileDescriptors structured as a pair of sockets
     * connected to each other. The two sockets are indistinguishable.
     * <p>
     * Both ends have the ability to deliver an error message through
     * {@link #closeWithError(String)} which can be detected by the other end
     * calling {@link #checkError()}, usually after detecting an EOF.
     * This can also be used to detect remote crashes.
