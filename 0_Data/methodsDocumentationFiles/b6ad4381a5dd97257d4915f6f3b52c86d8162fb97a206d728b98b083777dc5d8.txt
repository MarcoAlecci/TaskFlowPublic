         * Used to inform the text layout that the given length is replaced with the object of given
         * width.
         *
         * Keeps an internal offset which increases at every append. The initial value for this
         * offset is zero. After the style is applied the internal offset is moved to {@code offset
         * + length}, and next call will start from this new position.
         *
         * Informs the layout engine that the given length should not be processed, instead the
         * provided width should be used for calculating the width of that range.
         *
         * @param length a length to be replaced with the object, can not exceed the length of the
         *               text
         * @param width a replacement width of the range
