     * Create an intent to launch the main (root) activity of a task.  This
     * is the Intent that is started when the application's is launched from
     * Home.  For anything else that wants to launch an application in the
     * same way, it is important that they use an Intent structured the same
     * way, and can use this function to ensure this is the case.
     *
     * <p>The returned Intent has the given Activity component as its explicit
     * component, {@link #ACTION_MAIN} as its action, and includes the
     * category {@link #CATEGORY_LAUNCHER}.  This does <em>not</em> have
     * {@link #FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} set, though typically you will want
     * to do that through {@link #addFlags(int)} on the returned Intent.
     *
     * @param mainActivity The main activity component that this Intent will
     * launch.
     * @return Returns a newly created Intent that can be used to launch the
     * activity as a main application entry.
