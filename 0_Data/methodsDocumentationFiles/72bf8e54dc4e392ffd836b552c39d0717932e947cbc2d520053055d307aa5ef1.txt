     * changes the default subscription id).

     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This method used to display a disambiguation dialog to
     * the user asking them to choose a default subscription to send SMS messages over if they
     * haven't chosen yet. Starting in API level 29, we allow the user to not have a default set as
     * a valid option for the default SMS subscription on multi-SIM devices. We no longer show the
     * disambiguation dialog and return {@link SubscriptionManager#INVALID_SUBSCRIPTION_ID} if the
     * device has multiple active subscriptions and no default is set.

     * @return associated subscription ID or {@link SubscriptionManager#INVALID_SUBSCRIPTION_ID} if
     * the default subscription id cannot be determined or the device has multiple active
     * subscriptions and and no default is set ("ask every time") by the user.
