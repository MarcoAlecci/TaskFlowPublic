     * Returns the average current in mA consumed by the subsystem for the given level.
     *
     * @param type  the subsystem type
     * @param level the level of power at which the subsystem is running. For instance, the
     *              signal strength of the cell network between 0 and 4 (if there are 4 bars max.)
     *              If there is no data for multiple levels, the level is ignored.
     * @return the average current in milliAmps.
