     * Set the {@link SurfaceTexture} for this view to use. If a {@link
     * SurfaceTexture} is already being used by this view, it is immediately
     * released and not usable any more.  The {@link
     * SurfaceTextureListener#onSurfaceTextureDestroyed} callback is <b>not</b>
     * called for the previous {@link SurfaceTexture}.  Similarly, the {@link

     * called for the {@link SurfaceTexture} passed to setSurfaceTexture.
     *
     * The {@link SurfaceTexture} object must be detached from all OpenGL ES
     * contexts prior to calling this method.
     *
     * @param surfaceTexture The {@link SurfaceTexture} that the view should use.
