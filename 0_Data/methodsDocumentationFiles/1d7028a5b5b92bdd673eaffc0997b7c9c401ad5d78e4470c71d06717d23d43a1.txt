     * Inverts a 4 x 4 matrix.
     * <p>
     * mInv and m must not overlap.
     *
     * @param mInv the array that holds the output inverted matrix
     * @param mInvOffset an offset into mInv where the inverted matrix is
     *        stored.
     * @param m the input array
     * @param mOffset an offset into m where the input matrix is stored.
     * @return true if the matrix could be inverted, false if it could not.
