     * <p>
     * Devices may have multiple active network connections simultaneously, or
     * they may not have a default network route at all. To correctly handle all
     * situations like this, your job should always use the network returned by
     * this method instead of implicitly using the default network route.
     * <p>
     * Note that the system may relax the constraints you originally requested,
     * such as allowing a {@link JobInfo#NETWORK_TYPE_UNMETERED} job to run over
     * a metered network when there is a surplus of metered data available.
