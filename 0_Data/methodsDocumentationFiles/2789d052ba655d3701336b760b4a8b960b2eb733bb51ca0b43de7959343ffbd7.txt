         * Used for intercepting any started activity.
         *
         * <p> A non-null return value here will be considered a hit for this monitor.
         * By default this will return {@code null} and subclasses can override this to return
         * a non-null value if the intent needs to be intercepted.
         *
         * <p> Whenever a new activity is started, this method will be called on instances created
         * using {@link #ActivityMonitor()} to check if there is a match. In case
         * of a match, the activity start will be blocked and the returned result will be used.
         *
         * @param intent The intent used for starting the activity.
         * @return The {@link ActivityResult} that needs to be used in case of a match.
