     * This method retrieves a consecutive set of video frames starting at the
     * specified index. It should only be called after {@link #setDataSource}.
     *
     * If the caller intends to retrieve more than one consecutive video frames,
     * this method is preferred over {@link #getFrameAtIndex(int, BitmapParams)} for efficiency.
     *
     * After the bitmaps are returned, you can query the actual parameters that were
     * used to create the bitmaps from the {@code BitmapParams} argument, for instance
     * to query the bitmap config used for the bitmaps with {@link BitmapParams#getActualConfig}.
     *
     * @param frameIndex 0-based index of the first video frame to retrieve. The frame index
     *        must be that of a valid frame. The total number of frames available for retrieval
     *        can be queried via the {@link #METADATA_KEY_VIDEO_FRAME_COUNT} key.
     * @param numFrames number of consecutive video frames to retrieve. Must be a positive
     *        value. The stream must contain at least numFrames frames starting at frameIndex.
     * @param params BitmapParams that controls the returned bitmap config (such as pixel formats).
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the container doesn't contain video or image sequences.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the frameIndex or numFrames is invalid, or the
     *         stream doesn't contain at least numFrames starting at frameIndex.

     * @return An list of Bitmaps containing the requested video frames. The returned
     *         array could contain less frames than requested if the retrieval fails.
