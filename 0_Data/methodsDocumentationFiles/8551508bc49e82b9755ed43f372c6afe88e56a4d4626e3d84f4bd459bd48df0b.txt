     * Override this to intercept special key multiple events before they are
     * processed by the
     * application.  If you return true, the application will not itself
     * process the event.  If you return false, the normal application processing
     * will occur as if the IME had not seen the event at all.
     * 
     * <p>The default implementation always returns false, except when
     * in fullscreen mode, where it will consume DPAD movement
     * events to move the cursor in the extracted text view, not allowing
     * them to perform navigation in the underlying application.
