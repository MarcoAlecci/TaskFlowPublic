     * Ensure that subscriptions will be retained on the next factory reset.
     *
     * <p>By default, all subscriptions on the eUICC are erased the first time a device boots (ever
     * and after factory resets). This ensures that the data is wiped after a factory reset is
     * performed via fastboot or recovery mode, as these modes do not support the necessary radio
     * communication needed to wipe the eSIM.
     *
     * <p>However, this method may be called right before a factory reset issued via settings when
     * the user elects to retain subscriptions. Doing so will mark them for retention so that they
     * are not cleared after the ensuing reset.
     *
     * <p>Requires that the calling app has the {@link android.Manifest.permission#MASTER_CLEAR}
     * permission. This is for internal system use only.
