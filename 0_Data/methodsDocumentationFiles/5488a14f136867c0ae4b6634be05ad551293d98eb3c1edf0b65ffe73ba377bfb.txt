         * A LayoutManager can call this method to force RecyclerView to run simple animations in
         * the next layout pass, even if there is not any trigger to do so. (e.g. adapter data
         * change).
         * <p>
         * Note that, calling this method will not guarantee that RecyclerView will run animations
         * at all. For example, if there is not any {@link ItemAnimator} set, RecyclerView will
         * not run any animations but will still clear this flag after the layout is complete.
