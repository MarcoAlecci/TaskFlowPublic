     * Same as getLocales(), except that locales that are only provided by the system (i.e. those
     * present in framework-res.apk or its overlays) will not be listed.
     *
     * For example, if the "system" assets support English, French, and German, and the additional
     * assets support Cherokee and French, getLocales() would return
     * [Cherokee, English, French, German], while getNonSystemLocales() would return
     * [Cherokee, French].
