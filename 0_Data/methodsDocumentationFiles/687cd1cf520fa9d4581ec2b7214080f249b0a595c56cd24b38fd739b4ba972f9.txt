     * Switch the current capture session and a given set of registered camera surfaces
     * to offline processing mode.
     *
     * <p>Offline processing mode and the corresponding {@link CameraOfflineSession} differ from
     * a regular online camera capture session in several ways. Successful offline switches will
     * close the currently active camera capture session. Camera clients are also allowed
     * to call {@link CameraDevice#close} while offline processing of selected capture
     * requests is still in progress. Such side effects free device close is only possible
     * when the offline session moves to the ready state. Once this happens, closing the camera
     * device will not affect the pending offline requests and they must complete as normal.</p>
     *
     * <p>Offline processing mode switches may need several hundred milliseconds to complete
     * as the underlying camera implementation must abort all currently active repeating requests
     * as well as all other pending requests not specified by the client. Additionally the switch
     * will be blocked until all requests that continue processing within the offline session
     * acquire their initial input frame from camera sensor. The call to {@link #switchToOffline}
     * itself is not blocking and will only trigger the offline switch sequence. Clients will
     * be notified via {@link CameraOfflineSessionCallback#onReady} once the entire sequence is
     * complete.</p>
     *
     * <p>Please note that after a successful call to this method the currently active capture
     * session will no longer be valid and clients will begin receiving capture
     * callbacks with a corresponding {@link CameraOfflineSession} passed as a session
     * argument.</p>

     * @param offlineSurfaces Client-specified collection of input/output camera registered surfaces
     *                        that need to be switched to offline mode along with their pending
     *                        capture requests. Do note that not all camera registered
     *                        surfaces can be switched to offline mode. Offline processing
     *                        support for individual surfaces can be queried using
     *                        {@link #supportsOfflineProcessing}. Additionally offline mode
     *                        switches are not available for shared surfaces
     *                        {@link OutputConfiguration#enableSurfaceSharing} and surfaces

     *         {@link CameraOfflineSessionCallback#onSwitchFailed} notification.
