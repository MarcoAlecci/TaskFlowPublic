     * Swap top/bottom or left/right if there are flipped (i.e. left > right
     * and/or top > bottom). This can be called if
     * the edges are computed separately, and may have crossed over each other.
     * If the edges are already correct (i.e. left <= right and top <= bottom)
     * then nothing is done.
