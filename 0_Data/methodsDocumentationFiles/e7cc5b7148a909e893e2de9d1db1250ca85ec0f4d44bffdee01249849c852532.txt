     * Returns a ranking score for a given RSSI which can be used to comparatively
     * rank networks.
     *
     * <p>The score obtained by the rssiCurve is bitshifted left by 8 bits to expand it to an
     * integer and then the offset is added. If the addition operation overflows or underflows,
     * Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE will be returned respectively.
     *
     * <p>{@link #hasRankingScore} should be called first to ensure this network is capable
     * of returning a ranking score.
     *
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if there is no RssiCurve and no rankingScoreOffset
     * for this network (hasRankingScore returns false).
