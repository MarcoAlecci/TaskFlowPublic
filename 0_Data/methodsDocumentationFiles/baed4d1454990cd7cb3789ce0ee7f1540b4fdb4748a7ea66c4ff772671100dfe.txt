     * Sets the current tab.
     * <p>
     * This method is used to bring a tab to the front of the Widget,
     * and is used to post to the rest of the UI that a different tab
     * has been brought to the foreground.
     * <p>
     * Note, this is separate from the traditional "focus" that is
     * employed from the view logic.
     * <p>
     * For instance, if we have a list in a tabbed view, a user may be
     * navigating up and down the list, moving the UI focus (orange
     * highlighting) through the list items.  The cursor movement does
     * not effect the "selected" tab though, because what is being
     * scrolled through is all on the same tab.  The selected tab only
     * changes when we navigate between tabs (moving from the list view
     * to the next tabbed view, in this example).
     * <p>
     * To move both the focus AND the selected tab at once, please use
     * {@link #focusCurrentTab}. Normally, the view logic takes care of
     * adjusting the focus, so unless you're circumventing the UI,
     * you'll probably just focus your interest here.
     *
     * @param index the index of the tab that you want to indicate as the
     *              selected tab (tab brought to the front of the widget)
     * @see #focusCurrentTab
