     * Returns an indication of the result of the drag and drop operation.
     * This method only returns valid data if the action type is {@link #ACTION_DRAG_ENDED}.
     * The return value depends on what happens after the user releases the drag shadow.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the user releases the drag shadow on a View that can accept a drop, the system sends an
     * {@link #ACTION_DROP} event to the View object's drag event listener. If the listener
     * returns {@code true}, then getResult() will return {@code true}.
     * If the listener returns {@code false}, then getResult() returns {@code false}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Notice that getResult() also returns {@code false} if no {@link #ACTION_DROP} is sent. This
     * happens, for example, when the user releases the drag shadow over an area outside of the
     * application. In this case, the system sends out {@link #ACTION_DRAG_ENDED} for the current
     * operation, but never sends out {@link #ACTION_DROP}.
     * </p>
     * @return {@code true} if a drag event listener returned {@code true} in response to
     * {@link #ACTION_DROP}. If the system did not send {@link #ACTION_DROP} before
     * {@link #ACTION_DRAG_ENDED}, or if the listener returned {@code false} in response to
     * {@link #ACTION_DROP}, then {@code false} is returned.
