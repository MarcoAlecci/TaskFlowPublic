     * Called when the fullscreen-mode extracting editor info has changed,
     * to update the state of its UI such as the action buttons shown.
     * You do not need to deal with this if you are using the standard
     * full screen extract UI.  If replacing it, you will need to re-implement
     * this to put the appropriate action button in your own UI and handle it,
     * and perform any other changes.
     * 
     * <p>The standard implementation turns on or off its accessory area
     * depending on whether there is an action button, and hides or shows
     * the entire extract area depending on whether it makes sense for the
     * current editor.  In particular, a {@link InputType#TYPE_NULL} or 
     * {@link InputType#TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_FILTER} input type will turn off the
     * extract area since there is no text to be shown.
