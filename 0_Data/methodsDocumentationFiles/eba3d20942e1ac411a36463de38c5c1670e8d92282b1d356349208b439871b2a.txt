     * Implement this method to handle touch screen motion events.
     * <p>
     * If this method is used to detect click actions, it is recommended that
     * the actions be performed by implementing and calling
     * {@link #performClick()}. This will ensure consistent system behavior,
     * including:
     * <ul>
     * <li>obeying click sound preferences
     * <li>dispatching OnClickListener calls
     * <li>handling {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo#ACTION_CLICK ACTION_CLICK} when
     * accessibility features are enabled
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param event The motion event.
     * @return True if the event was handled, false otherwise.
