     * Returns an {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo} representing a virtual view,
     * such as a descendant of the host View, with the given <code>virtualViewId</code>
     * or the host View itself if <code>virtualViewId</code> equals to {@link #HOST_VIEW_ID}.
     * <p>
     * A virtual descendant is an imaginary View that is reported as a part of the view
     * hierarchy for accessibility purposes. This enables custom views that draw complex
     * content to report them selves as a tree of virtual views, thus conveying their
     * logical structure.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The implementer is responsible for obtaining an accessibility node info from the
     * pool of reusable instances and setting the desired properties of the node info
     * before returning it.
     * </p>

     * @param virtualViewId A client defined virtual view id.
     * @return A populated {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo} for a virtual descendant or the
     *     host View.
