     * Offers the user an opportunity to change an authenticator's settings.
     * These properties are for the authenticator in general, not a particular
     * account.  Not all authenticators support this method.
     *
     * <p>This method may be called from any thread, but the returned
     * {@link AccountManagerFuture} must not be used on the main thread.
     *
     * <p>This method requires the caller to have the same signature as the
     * authenticator associated with the specified account type.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If targeting your app to work on API level 22 and before,
     * MANAGE_ACCOUNTS permission is needed for those platforms. See docs
     * for this function in API level 22.
     *
     * @param accountType The account type associated with the authenticator
     *     to adjust
     * @param activity The {@link Activity} context to use for launching a new
     *     authenticator-defined sub-Activity to adjust authenticator settings;
     *     used only to call startActivity(); if null, the settings dialog will
     *     not be launched directly, but the necessary {@link Intent} will be
     *     returned to the caller instead
     * @param callback Callback to invoke when the request completes,
     *     null for no callback
     * @param handler {@link Handler} identifying the callback thread,
     *     null for the main thread
     * @return An {@link AccountManagerFuture} which resolves to a Bundle
     *     which is empty if properties were edited successfully, or
     *     if no activity was specified, contains only {@link #KEY_INTENT}
     *     needed to launch the authenticator's settings dialog.
     *     If an error occurred, {@link AccountManagerFuture#getResult()}
     *     throws:
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link AuthenticatorException} if no authenticator was registered for
     *      this account type or the authenticator failed to respond
     * <li> {@link OperationCanceledException} if the operation was canceled for
     *      any reason, including the user canceling the settings dialog
     * <li> {@link IOException} if the authenticator experienced an I/O problem
     *      updating settings, usually because of network trouble
     * </ul>
