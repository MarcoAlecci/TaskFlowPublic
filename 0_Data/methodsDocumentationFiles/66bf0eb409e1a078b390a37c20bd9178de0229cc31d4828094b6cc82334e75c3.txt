     * Load a nano app on a specified context hub.
     *
     * Note that loading is asynchronous.  When we return from this method,
     * the nano app (probably) hasn't loaded yet.  Assuming a return of 0
     * from this method, then the final success/failure for the load, along
     * with the "handle" for the nanoapp, is all delivered in a byte
     * string via a call to Callback.onMessageReceipt.
     *
     * TODO(b/30784270): Provide a better success/failure and "handle" delivery.
     *
     * @param hubHandle handle of context hub to load the app on.
     * @param app the nanoApp to load on the hub
     *
     * @return 0 if the command for loading was sent to the context hub;
     *         -1 otherwise
     *
     * @see NanoApp
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #loadNanoApp(ContextHubInfo, NanoAppBinary)} instead.
