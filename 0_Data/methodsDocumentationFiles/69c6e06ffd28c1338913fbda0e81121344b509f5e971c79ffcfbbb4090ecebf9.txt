     * {@link #setStream(InputStream, Rect, boolean)} and passing {@code null} for the
     * {@code visibleCrop} rectangle and {@code true} for the {@code allowBackup}
     * parameter.
     *
     * <p>This method requires the caller to hold the permission
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#SET_WALLPAPER}.
     *
     * @param bitmapData A stream containing the raw data to install as a wallpaper.  This
     *     data can be in any format handled by {@link BitmapRegionDecoder}.
     *

     *     based on the provided image data.
