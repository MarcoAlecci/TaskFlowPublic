         * By passing true to this method, the build method will compute all full layout
         * information.
         *
         * If you don't use {@link MeasuredText#getBounds(int,int,android.graphics.Rect)}, you can
         * pass false to this method and save the memory spaces. The default value is true.
         *
         * Even if you pass false to this method, you can still call getBounds but it becomes
         * slower.
         *
         * @param computeLayout true if you want to retrieve full layout info, e.g. bbox.
