     * Returns the broadcast intent to fire with
     * {@link Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String, BroadcastReceiver, android.os.Handler, int, String, Bundle)}
     * to receive details from the package that implements voice search.
     * <p>
     * This is based on the value specified by the voice search {@link Activity} in
     * {@link #DETAILS_META_DATA}, and if this is not specified, will return null. Also if there
     * is no chosen default to resolve for {@link #ACTION_WEB_SEARCH}, this will return null.
     * <p>
     * If an intent is returned and is fired, a {@link Bundle} of extras will be returned to the
     * provided result receiver, and should ideally contain values for
     * {@link #EXTRA_LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE} and {@link #EXTRA_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES}.
     * <p>
     * (Whether these are actually provided is up to the particular implementation. It is
     * recommended that {@link Activity}s implementing {@link #ACTION_WEB_SEARCH} provide this
     * information, but it is not required.)
     * 
     * @param context a context object
     * @return the broadcast intent to fire or null if not available
