     * Return a new Context object for the current Context but whose storage
     * APIs are backed by device-protected storage.
     * <p>
     * On devices with direct boot, data stored in this location is encrypted
     * with a key tied to the physical device, and it can be accessed
     * immediately after the device has booted successfully, both
     * <em>before and after</em> the user has authenticated with their
     * credentials (such as a lock pattern or PIN).
     * <p>
     * Because device-protected data is available without user authentication,
     * you should carefully limit the data you store using this Context. For
     * example, storing sensitive authentication tokens or passwords in the
     * device-protected area is strongly discouraged.
     * <p>
     * If the underlying device does not have the ability to store
     * device-protected and credential-protected data using different keys, then
     * both storage areas will become available at the same time. They remain as
     * two distinct storage locations on disk, and only the window of
     * availability changes.
     * <p>
     * Each call to this method returns a new instance of a Context object;
     * Context objects are not shared, however common state (ClassLoader, other
     * Resources for the same configuration) may be so the Context itself can be
     * fairly lightweight.
