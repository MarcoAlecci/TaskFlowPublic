     * Notify the host application that an SSL error occurred while loading a
     * resource. The host application must call either {@link SslErrorHandler#cancel} or
     * {@link SslErrorHandler#proceed}. Note that the decision may be retained for use in
     * response to future SSL errors. The default behavior is to cancel the
     * load.
     * <p>
     * This API is only called for recoverable SSL certificate errors. In the case of
     * non-recoverable errors (such as when the server fails the client), WebView will call {@link
     * #onReceivedError(WebView, WebResourceRequest, WebResourceError)} with {@link
     * #ERROR_FAILED_SSL_HANDSHAKE}.
     * <p>
     * Applications are advised not to prompt the user about SSL errors, as
     * the user is unlikely to be able to make an informed security decision
     * and WebView does not provide any UI for showing the details of the
     * error in a meaningful way.
     * <p>
     * Application overrides of this method may display custom error pages or
     * silently log issues, but it is strongly recommended to always call
     * {@link SslErrorHandler#cancel} and never allow proceeding past errors.
     *
     * @param view The WebView that is initiating the callback.
     * @param handler An {@link SslErrorHandler} that will handle the user's
     *            response.
     * @param error The SSL error object.
