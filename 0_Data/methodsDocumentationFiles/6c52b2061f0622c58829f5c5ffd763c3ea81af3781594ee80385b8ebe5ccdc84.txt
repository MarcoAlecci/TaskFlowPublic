     * Create a new String object containing the given range of characters
     * from the source string.  This is different than simply calling
     * {@link CharSequence#subSequence(int, int) CharSequence.subSequence}
     * in that it does not preserve any style runs in the source sequence,
     * allowing a more efficient implementation.
