     * Returns the default SSL socket factory.
     *
     * <p>The first time this method is called, the security property
     * "ssl.SocketFactory.provider" is examined. If it is non-null, a class by
     * that name is loaded and instantiated. If that is successful and the
     * object is an instance of SSLSocketFactory, it is made the default SSL
     * socket factory.
     *
     * <p>Otherwise, this method returns
     * <code>SSLContext.getDefault().getSocketFactory()</code>. If that
     * call fails, an inoperative factory is returned.
     *
     * @return the default <code>SocketFactory</code>
     * @see SSLContext#getDefault
