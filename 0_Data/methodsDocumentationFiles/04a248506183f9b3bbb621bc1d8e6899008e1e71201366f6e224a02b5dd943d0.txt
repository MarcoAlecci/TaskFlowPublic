     * Returns the text classifier that was set via {@link #setTextClassifier(TextClassifier)}.
     * If this is null, this method returns a default text classifier (i.e. either the system text
     * classifier if one exists, or a local text classifier running in this process.)
     * <p>
     * Note that requests to the TextClassifier may be handled in an OEM-provided process rather
     * than in the calling app's process.
