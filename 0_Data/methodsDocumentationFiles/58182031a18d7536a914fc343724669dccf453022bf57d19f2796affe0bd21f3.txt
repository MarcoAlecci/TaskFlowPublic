         * @return A mapping of domain -> set of pairs (canonical file; required transport flags)
         * in that domain that are to be included if the transport has decared the required flags.
         * Each of these paths specifies a file that the client has explicitly included in their
         * backup set. If this map is empty we will back up the entire data directory (including
         * managed external storage).
