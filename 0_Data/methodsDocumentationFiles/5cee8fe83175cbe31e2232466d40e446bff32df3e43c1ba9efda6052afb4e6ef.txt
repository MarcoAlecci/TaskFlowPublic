     * Return true if the specified path, after being transformed by the
     * current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call
     * this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and
     * therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Note: for speed it may
     * return false even if the path itself might not intersect the clip
     * (i.e. the bounds of the path intersects, but the path does not).
     *
     * @param path        The path to compare with the current clip
     * @return            true if the path (transformed by the canvas' matrix)
     *                    does not intersect with the canvas' clip
