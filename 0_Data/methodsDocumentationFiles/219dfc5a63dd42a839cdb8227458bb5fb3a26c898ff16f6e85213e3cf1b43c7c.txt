     * fullscreen mode.  The default implementation runs in fullsceen only
     * when the screen is in landscape mode.  If you change what
     * this returns, you will need to call {@link #updateFullscreenMode()}
     * yourself whenever the returned value may have changed to have it
     * re-evaluated and applied.
