     * Tests whether this {@code BigInteger} is probably prime. If {@code true}
     * is returned, then this is prime with a probability greater than
     * {@code 1 - 1/2<sup>certainty</sup>)}. If {@code false} is returned, then this
     * is definitely composite. If the argument {@code certainty} <= 0, then
     * this method returns true.
     *
     * @param certainty tolerated primality uncertainty.
     * @return {@code true}, if {@code this} is probably prime, {@code false}
     *     otherwise.
