     * Editors may use this method to provide initial input text to IMEs. As the surrounding text
     * could be used to provide various input assistance, we recommend editors to provide the
     * complete initial input text in its {@link View#onCreateInputConnection(EditorInfo)} callback.
     * The supplied text will then be processed to serve {@code #getInitialTextBeforeCursor},
     * {@code #getInitialSelectedText}, and {@code #getInitialTextBeforeCursor}. System is allowed
     * to trim {@code sourceText} for various reasons while keeping the most valuable data to IMEs.
     *
     * <p><strong>Editor authors: </strong>Providing the initial input text helps reducing IPC calls
     * for IMEs to provide many modern features right after the connection setup. We recommend
     * calling this method in your implementation.
     *
     * @param sourceText The complete input text.
