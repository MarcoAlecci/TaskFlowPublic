     * The default implementation performs the deletion around the current selection position of the
     * editable text.
     *
     * @param beforeLength The number of characters before the cursor to be deleted, in code unit.
     *        If this is greater than the number of existing characters between the beginning of the
     *        text and the cursor, then this method does not fail but deletes all the characters in
     *        that range.
     * @param afterLength The number of characters after the cursor to be deleted, in code unit.
     *        If this is greater than the number of existing characters between the cursor and
     *        the end of the text, then this method does not fail but deletes all the characters in
     *        that range.
     *
     * @return {@code true} when selected text is deleted, {@code false} when either the
     *         selection is invalid or not yet attached (i.e. selection start or end is -1),
     *         or the editable text is {@code null}.
