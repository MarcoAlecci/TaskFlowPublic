         * Get a hint that this notification's background should not be clipped if possible,
         * and should instead be resized to fully display on the screen, retaining the aspect
         * ratio of the image. This can be useful for images like barcodes or qr codes.
         * @return {@code true} if it's ok if the background is clipped on the screen, false
         * otherwise. The default value is {@code false} if this was never set.
