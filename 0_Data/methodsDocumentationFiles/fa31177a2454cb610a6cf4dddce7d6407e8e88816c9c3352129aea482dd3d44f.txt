     * Sets the screen state to use while dozing.
     * <p>
     * The value of this property determines the power state of the primary display
     * once {@link #startDozing} has been called.  The default value is
     * {@link Display#STATE_UNKNOWN} which lets the system decide.
     * The dream may set a different state before starting to doze and may
     * perform transitions between states while dozing to conserve power and
     * achieve various effects.
     * </p><p>
     * Some devices will have dedicated hardware ("Sidekick") to animate
     * the display content while the CPU sleeps. If the dream and the hardware support
     * this, {@link Display#STATE_ON_SUSPEND} or {@link Display#STATE_DOZE_SUSPEND}
     * will switch control to the Sidekick.
     * </p><p>
     * If not using Sidekick, it is recommended that the state be set to
     * {@link Display#STATE_DOZE_SUSPEND} once the dream has completely
     * finished drawing and before it releases its wakelock
     * to allow the display hardware to be fully suspended.  While suspended,
     * the display will preserve its on-screen contents.
     * </p><p>
     * If the doze suspend state is used, the dream must make sure to set the mode back
     * to {@link Display#STATE_DOZE} or {@link Display#STATE_ON} before drawing again
     * since the display updates may be ignored and not seen by the user otherwise.
     * </p><p>
     * The set of available display power states and their behavior while dozing is
     * hardware dependent and may vary across devices.  The dream may therefore
     * need to be modified or configured to correctly support the hardware.
     * </p>

     * @param state The screen state to use while dozing, such as {@link Display#STATE_ON},

     * {@link Display#STATE_ON_SUSPEND}, {@link Display#STATE_OFF}, or {@link Display#STATE_UNKNOWN}
