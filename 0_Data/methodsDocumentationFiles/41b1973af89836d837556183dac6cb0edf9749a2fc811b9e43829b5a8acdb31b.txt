     * Get the primary colors of a wallpaper.
     *
     * <p>This method can return {@code null} when:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Colors are still being processed by the system.</li>
     * <li>The user has chosen to use a live wallpaper:  live wallpapers might not
     * implement
     * {@link android.service.wallpaper.WallpaperService.Engine#onComputeColors()
     *     WallpaperService.Engine#onComputeColors()}.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>Please note that this API will go through IPC and may take some time to
     * calculate the wallpaper color, which could block the caller thread, so it is
     * not recommended to call this in the UI thread.</p>
     *
     * @param which Wallpaper type. Must be either {@link #FLAG_SYSTEM} or
     *     {@link #FLAG_LOCK}.
     * @return Current {@link WallpaperColors} or null if colors are unknown.
