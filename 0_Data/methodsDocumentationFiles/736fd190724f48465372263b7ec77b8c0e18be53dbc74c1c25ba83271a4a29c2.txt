         * Returns an insets type representing the system gesture insets.
         *
         * <p>The system gesture insets represent the area of a window where system gestures have
         * priority and may consume some or all touch input, e.g. due to the a system bar
         * occupying it, or it being reserved for touch-only gestures.
         *
         * <p>Simple taps are guaranteed to reach the window even within the system gesture insets,
         * as long as they are outside the {@link #getSystemWindowInsets() system window insets}.
         *
         * <p>When {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE} is requested, an inset will be returned
         * even when the system gestures are inactive due to
         * {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN} or
         * {@link View#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION}.
