     * Converts all numbers in the CharBuffer into longs, and puts into the given long[].
     *
     * Space and colon are treated as delimiters. All other chars are not allowed. All numbers
     * are non-negative. To avoid GC, caller should try to use the same array for all calls.
     *
     * This method also resets the given buffer to the original position before return so that
     * it can be read again.
     *
     * @param buf   The char buffer to be converted.
     * @param array An array to store the parsed numbers.
     * @return The number of elements written to the given array. -1 if buf is null, -2 if buf
     * contains invalid char, -3 if any number overflows.
