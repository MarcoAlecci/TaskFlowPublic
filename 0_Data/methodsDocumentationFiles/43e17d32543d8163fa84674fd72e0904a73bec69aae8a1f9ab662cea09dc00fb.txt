     * Advances this scanner past the current line and returns the input
     * that was skipped.
     *
     * This method returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line
     * separator at the end. The position is set to the beginning of the next
     * line.
     *
     * <p>Since this method continues to search through the input looking
     * for a line separator, it may buffer all of the input searching for
     * the line to skip if no line separators are present.
     *
     * @return the line that was skipped
     * @throws NoSuchElementException if no line was found
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this scanner is closed
