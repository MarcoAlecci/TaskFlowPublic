     * Sets the startDelay of this transition. By default, there is no delay
     * (indicated by a negative number), which means that the Animator created by
     * the transition will have its own specified startDelay. If the delay of a
     * Transition is set, that delay will override the Animator delay.
     *
     * @param startDelay The length of the delay, in milliseconds.
     * @return This transition object.
