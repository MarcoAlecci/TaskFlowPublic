     * Build URI representing the children of the target directory in a document
     * provider. When queried, a provider will return zero or more rows with
     * columns defined by {@link Document}.
     * <p>
     * However, instead of directly accessing the target directory, the returned
     * URI will leverage access granted through a subtree URI, typically
     * returned by {@link Intent#ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE}. The target
     * directory must be a descendant (child, grandchild, etc) of the subtree.
     * <p>
     * This is typically used to access documents under a user-selected
     * directory tree, since it doesn't require the user to separately confirm
     * each new document access.
     *
     * @param treeUri the subtree to leverage to gain access to the target
     *            document. The target directory must be a descendant of this
     *            subtree.
     * @param parentDocumentId the document to return children for, which the
     *            caller may not have direct access to, and which must be a
     *            directory with MIME type of {@link Document#MIME_TYPE_DIR}.
