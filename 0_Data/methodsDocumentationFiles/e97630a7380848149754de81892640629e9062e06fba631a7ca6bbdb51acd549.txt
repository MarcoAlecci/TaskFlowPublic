     * Apply an effect to GL textures.
     *
     * <p>Apply the Effect on the specified input GL texture, and write the result into the
     * output GL texture. The texture names passed must be valid in the current GL context.</p>
     *
     * <p>The input texture must be a valid texture name with the given width and height and must be
     * bound to a GL_TEXTURE_2D texture image (usually done by calling the glTexImage2D() function).
     * Multiple mipmap levels may be provided.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the output texture has not been bound to a texture image, it will be automatically
     * bound by the effect as a GL_TEXTURE_2D. It will contain one mipmap level (0), which will have
     * the same size as the input. No other mipmap levels are defined. If the output texture was
     * bound already, and its size does not match the input texture size, the result may be clipped
     * or only partially fill the texture.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note, that regardless of whether a texture image was originally provided or not, both the
     * input and output textures are owned by the caller. That is, the caller is responsible for
     * calling glDeleteTextures() to deallocate the input and output textures.</p>
     *
     * @param inputTexId The GL texture name of a valid and bound input texture.
     * @param width The width of the input texture in pixels.
     * @param height The height of the input texture in pixels.
     * @param outputTexId The GL texture name of the output texture.
