     * Reads all the bytes from a file. The method ensures that the file is
     * closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
     * exception, is thrown.
     *
     * <p> Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
     * convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
     * reading in large files.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     *
     * @return  a byte array containing the bytes read from the file
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs reading from the stream
     * @throws  OutOfMemoryError
     *          if an array of the required size cannot be allocated, for
     *          example the file is larger that {@code 2GB}
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
