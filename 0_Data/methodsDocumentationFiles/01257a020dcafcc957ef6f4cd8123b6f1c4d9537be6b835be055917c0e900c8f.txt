     * Registers a custom provider of {@link android.net.NetworkStats} to provide network statistics
     * to the system. To unregister, invoke {@link #unregisterNetworkStatsProvider}.
     * Note that no de-duplication of statistics between providers is performed, so each provider
     * must only report network traffic that is not being reported by any other provider. Also note
     * that the provider cannot be re-registered after unregistering.
     *
     * @param tag a human readable identifier of the custom network stats provider. This is only
     *            used for debugging.
     * @param provider the subclass of {@link NetworkStatsProvider} that needs to be
     *                 registered to the system.
