     * Resize a 1D allocation.  The contents of the allocation are preserved.
     * If new elements are allocated objects are created with null contents and
     * the new region is otherwise undefined.
     *
     * <p>If the new region is smaller the references of any objects outside the
     * new region will be released.</p>
     *
     * <p>A new type will be created with the new dimension.</p>
     *
     * @param dimX The new size of the allocation.
     *
     * @deprecated RenderScript objects should be immutable once created.  The
     * replacement is to create a new allocation and copy the contents. This
     * function will throw an exception if API 21 or higher is used.
