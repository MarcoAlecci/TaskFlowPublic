     * This method is called when the buffer is going to replace the
     * range <code>dstart &hellip; dend</code> of <code>dest</code>
     * with the new text from the range <code>start &hellip; end</code>
     * of <code>source</code>.  Returns the CharSequence that we want
     * placed there instead, including an empty string
     * if appropriate, or <code>null</code> to accept the original
     * replacement.  Be careful to not to reject 0-length replacements,
     * as this is what happens when you delete text.
