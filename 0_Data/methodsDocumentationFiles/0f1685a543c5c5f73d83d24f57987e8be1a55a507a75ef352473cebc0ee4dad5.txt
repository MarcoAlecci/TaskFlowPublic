         * Convenience function for updating a single settings value as an
         * integer. This will either create a new entry in the table if the
         * given name does not exist, or modify the value of the existing row
         * with that name.  Note that internally setting values are always
         * stored as strings, so this function converts the given value to a
         * string before storing it.
         *
         * @param cr The ContentResolver to access.
         * @param name The name of the setting to modify.
         * @param value The new value for the setting.
         * @return true if the value was set, false on database errors
