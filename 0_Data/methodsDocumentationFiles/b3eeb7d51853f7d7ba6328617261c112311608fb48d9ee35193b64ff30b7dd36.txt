     * Returns fine-grained carrier ID of the current subscription.
     *
     * A specific carrier ID can represent the fact that a carrier may be in effect an aggregation
     * of other carriers (ie in an MVNO type scenario) where each of these specific carriers which
     * are used to make up the actual carrier service may have different carrier configurations.
     * A specific carrier ID could also be used, for example, in a scenario where a carrier requires
     * different carrier configuration for different service offering such as a prepaid plan.
     *
     * the specific carrier ID would be used for configuration purposes, but apps wishing to know
     * about the carrier itself should use the regular carrier ID returned by
     * {@link #getSimCarrierId()}.
     *
     * e.g, Tracfone SIMs could return different specific carrier ID based on IMSI from current
     * subscription while carrier ID remains the same.
     *
     * <p>For carriers without fine-grained specific carrier ids, return {@link #getSimCarrierId()}
     * <p>Specific carrier ids are defined in the same way as carrier id
     * <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/providers/TelephonyProvider/+/master/assets/latest_carrier_id/carrier_list.textpb">here</a>
     * except each with a "parent" id linking to its top-level carrier id.
     *
     * @return Returns fine-grained carrier id of the current subscription.
     * Return {@link #UNKNOWN_CARRIER_ID} if the subscription is unavailable or the carrier cannot
     * be identified.
