     * Returns linger-on-close timeout. This option disables/enables immediate return 
     * from a close() of a TCP Socket. Enabling this option with a non-zero Integer 
     * timeout means that a close() will block pending the transmission and 
     * acknowledgement of all data written to the peer, at which point the socket is 
     * closed gracefully. Value <tt>0</tt> implies that the option is 
     * disabled. Value <tt>-1</tt> implies that the JRE default is used.
