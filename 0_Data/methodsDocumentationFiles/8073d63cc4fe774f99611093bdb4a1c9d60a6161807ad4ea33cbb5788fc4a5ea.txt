         * Writes the string {@param input} into the text stream to the UI for this RTT call. Since
         * RTT transmits text in real-time, this method should be called as often as text snippets
         * are received from the remote user, even if it is only one character.
         * <p>
         * This method is not thread-safe -- calling it from multiple threads simultaneously may
         * lead to interleaved text.
         *
         * @param input The message to send to the in-call app.
