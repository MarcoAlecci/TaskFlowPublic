     * Sets an asynchronous callback for actionable MediaCodec events on the default
     * looper.
     * <p>
     * Same as {@link #setCallback(Callback, Handler)} with handler set to null.
     * @param cb The callback that will run.  Use {@code null} to clear a previously
     *           set callback (before {@link #configure configure} is called and run
     *           in synchronous mode).
     * @see #setCallback(Callback, Handler)
