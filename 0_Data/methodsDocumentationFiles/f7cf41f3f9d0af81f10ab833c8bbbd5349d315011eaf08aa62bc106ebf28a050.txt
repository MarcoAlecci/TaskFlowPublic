     * When a device is locked, then {@link #showDialog} will not present a dialog, as it will
     * be under the lock screen. If the behavior of the Tile is safe to do while locked,
     * then the user should use {@link #startActivity} to launch an activity on top of the lock
     * screen, otherwise the tile should use {@link #unlockAndRun(Runnable)} to give the
     * user their security challenge.
