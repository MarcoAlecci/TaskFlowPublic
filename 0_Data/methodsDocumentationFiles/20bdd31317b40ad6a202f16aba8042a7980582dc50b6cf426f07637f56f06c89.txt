     * Like {@link #getDrawable()}, but the returned Drawable has a number
     * of limitations to reduce its overhead as much as possible. It will
     * never scale the wallpaper (only centering it if the requested bounds
     * do match the bitmap bounds, which should not be typical), doesn't
     * allow setting an alpha, color filter, or other attributes, etc.  The
     * bounds of the returned drawable will be initialized to the same bounds
     * as the wallpaper, so normally you will not need to touch it.  The
     * drawable also assumes that it will be used in a context running in
     * the same density as the screen (not in density compatibility mode).
     *
     * @return Returns a Drawable object that will draw the wallpaper.
