     * Normalize and set an explicit MIME data type.
     *
     * <p>This is used to create intents that only specify a type and not data,
     * for example to indicate the type of data to return.
     *
     * <p>This method automatically clears any data that was
     * previously set (for example by {@link #setData}).
     *
     * <p>The MIME type is normalized using
     * {@link #normalizeMimeType} before it is set,
     * so really this is just a convenience method for
     * <pre>
     * setType(Intent.normalizeMimeType(type))
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param type The MIME type of the data being handled by this intent.
     *
     * @return Returns the same Intent object, for chaining multiple calls
     * into a single statement.
