     * Apply an active Tunnel Mode IPsec Transform to a {@link IpSecTunnelInterface}, which will
     * tunnel all traffic for the given direction through the underlying network's interface with
     * IPsec (applies an outer IP header and IPsec Header to all traffic, and expects an additional
     * IP header and IPsec Header on all inbound traffic).
     * <p>Applications should probably not use this API directly.

     * @param tunnel The {@link IpSecManager#IpSecTunnelInterface} that will use the supplied
     *        transform.
     * @param direction the direction, {@link DIRECTION_OUT} or {@link #DIRECTION_IN} in which
     *        the transform will be used.
     * @param transform an {@link IpSecTransform} created in tunnel mode
     * @throws IOException indicating that the transform could not be applied due to a lower
     *         layer failure.
