     * This method must be overridden if an {@link IntentFilter} is specified on the SliceProvider.
     * In that case, this method can be called and is expected to return a non-null Uri representing
     * a slice. Otherwise this will throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * Any intent filter added to a slice provider should also contain
     * {@link SliceManager#CATEGORY_SLICE}, because otherwise it will not be detected by
     * {@link SliceManager#mapIntentToUri(Intent)}.
     *
     * @return Uri representing the slice associated with the provided intent.
