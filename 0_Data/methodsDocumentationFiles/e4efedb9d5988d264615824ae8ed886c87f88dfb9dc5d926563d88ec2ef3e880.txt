         * Add a network address to the VPN interface. Both IPv4 and IPv6
         * addresses are supported. At least one address must be set before
         * calling {@link #establish}.
         *
         * Adding an address implicitly allows traffic from that address family
         * (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6) to be routed over the VPN. @see #allowFamily
         *
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the address is invalid.
