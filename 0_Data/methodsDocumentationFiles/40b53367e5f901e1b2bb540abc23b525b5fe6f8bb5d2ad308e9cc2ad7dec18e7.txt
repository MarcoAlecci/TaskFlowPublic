         * Schedules an alarm intent with the system AlarmManager that will
         * notify listeners when a reminder should be fired. The provider will
         * keep scheduled reminders up to date but apps may use this to
         * implement snooze functionality without modifying the reminders table.
         * Scheduled alarms will generate an intent using
         * {@link #ACTION_EVENT_REMINDER}. TODO Move to provider
