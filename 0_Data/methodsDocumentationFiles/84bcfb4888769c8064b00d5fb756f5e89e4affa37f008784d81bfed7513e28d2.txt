     * Returns a scaled value of the approximate size for the given pointer
     * <em>index</em> (use {@link #getPointerId(int)} to find the pointer
     * identifier for this index).
     * This represents some approximation of the area of the screen being
     * pressed; the actual value in pixels corresponding to the
     * touch is normalized with the device specific range of values
     * and scaled to a value between 0 and 1. The value of size can be used to
     * determine fat touch events.
     * @param pointerIndex Raw index of pointer to retrieve.  Value may be from 0
     * (the first pointer that is down) to {@link #getPointerCount()}-1.
