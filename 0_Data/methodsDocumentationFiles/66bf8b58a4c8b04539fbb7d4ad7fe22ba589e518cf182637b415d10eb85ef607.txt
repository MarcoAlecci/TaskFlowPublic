     * Sets the Transition that will be used to move Views out of the scene when the Fragment is
     * preparing to be removed, hidden, or detached because of popping the back stack. The exiting
     * Views will be those that are regular Views or ViewGroups that have
     * {@link ViewGroup#isTransitionGroup} return true. Typical Transitions will extend
     * {@link android.transition.Visibility} as entering is governed by changing visibility from
     * {@link View#VISIBLE} to {@link View#INVISIBLE}. If <code>transition</code> is null,
     * entering Views will remain unaffected. If nothing is set, the default will be to
     * use the same value as set in {@link #setEnterTransition(android.transition.Transition)}.
