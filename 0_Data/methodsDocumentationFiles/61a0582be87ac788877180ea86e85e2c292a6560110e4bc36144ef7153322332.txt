     * The name of the package that requested the installation, or null if not available.
     *
     * This is normally the same as the installing package name. If the installing package name
     * is changed, for example by calling
     * {@link PackageManager#setInstallerPackageName(String, String)}, the initiating package name
     * remains unchanged. It continues to identify the actual package that performed the install
     * or update.
     * <p>
     * Null may be returned if the app was not installed by a package (e.g. a system app or an app
     * installed via adb) or if the initiating package has itself been uninstalled.
