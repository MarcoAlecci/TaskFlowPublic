     * Returns a bitmap from subset of the source bitmap,
     * transformed by the optional matrix. The new bitmap may be the
     * same object as source, or a copy may have been made. It is
     * initialized with the same density and color space as the original
     * bitmap.
     *
     * If the source bitmap is immutable and the requested subset is the
     * same as the source bitmap itself, then the source bitmap is
     * returned and no new bitmap is created.
     *
     * The returned bitmap will always be mutable except in the following scenarios:
     * (1) In situations where the source bitmap is returned and the source bitmap is immutable
     *
     * (2) The source bitmap is a hardware bitmap. That is {@link #getConfig()} is equivalent to
     * {@link Config#HARDWARE}
     *
     * @param source   The bitmap we are subsetting
     * @param x        The x coordinate of the first pixel in source
     * @param y        The y coordinate of the first pixel in source
     * @param width    The number of pixels in each row
     * @param height   The number of rows
     * @param m        Optional matrix to be applied to the pixels
     * @param filter   true if the source should be filtered.
     *                   Only applies if the matrix contains more than just
     *                   translation.
     * @return A bitmap that represents the specified subset of source
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the x, y, width, height values are
     *         outside of the dimensions of the source bitmap, or width is <= 0,
     *         or height is <= 0, or if the source bitmap has already been recycled
