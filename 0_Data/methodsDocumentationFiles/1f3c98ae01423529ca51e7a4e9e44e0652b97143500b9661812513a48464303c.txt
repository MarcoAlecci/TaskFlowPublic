     * Implemented to create a slice.
     * <p>
     * onBindSlice should return as quickly as possible so that the UI tied
     * to this slice can be responsive. No network or other IO will be allowed
     * during onBindSlice. Any loading that needs to be done should happen
     * in the background with a call to {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(Uri, ContentObserver)}
     * when the app is ready to provide the complete data in onBindSlice.
     * <p>
     * The slice returned should have a spec that is compatible with one of
     * the supported specs.
     *
     * @param sliceUri Uri to bind.
     * @param supportedSpecs List of supported specs.
