         * Sets the scene mode. Changing scene mode may override other
         * parameters (such as flash mode, focus mode, white balance). For
         * example, suppose originally flash mode is on and supported flash
         * modes are on/off. In night scene mode, both flash mode and supported
         * flash mode may be changed to off. After setting scene mode,
         * applications should call getParameters to know if some parameters are
         * changed.
