     * Returns this {@code BigInteger} as a double. If {@code this} is too big
     * to be represented as a double, then {@code Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY} or
     * {@code Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY} is returned. Note that not all integers
     * in the range {@code [-Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE]} can be exactly
     * represented as a double.
