         * This method is called independently of the others in CaptureCallback,
         * when a capture sequence aborts before any {@link CaptureResult}
         * or {@link CaptureFailure} for it have been returned via this listener.
         *
         * <p>Due to the asynchronous nature of the camera device, not all submitted captures
         * are immediately processed. It is possible to clear out the pending requests
         * by a variety of operations such as {@link CameraCaptureSession#stopRepeating} or
         * {@link CameraCaptureSession#abortCaptures}. When such an event happens,
         * {@link #onCaptureSequenceCompleted} will not be called.</p>
         *
         * <p>The default implementation does nothing.</p>
         *
         * @param session
         *            The session returned by {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession}
         * @param sequenceId
         *            A sequence ID returned by the {@link #capture} family of functions.
