     * Generates a unique file name under the given parent directory. If the display name doesn't
     * have an extension that matches the requested MIME type, the default extension for that MIME
     * type is appended. If a file already exists, the name is appended with a numerical value to
     * make it unique.
     *
     * For example, the display name 'example' with 'text/plain' MIME might produce
     * 'example.txt' or 'example (1).txt', etc.
