     * Dispatch a pointer event.
     * <p>
     * Dispatches touch related pointer events to {@link #onTouchEvent(MotionEvent)} and all
     * other events to {@link #onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent)}.  This separation of concerns
     * reinforces the invariant that {@link #onTouchEvent(MotionEvent)} is really about touches
     * and should not be expected to handle other pointing device features.

     * @param event The motion event to be dispatched.
     * @return True if the event was handled by the view, false otherwise.
     * @hide
