          * Draws shadows of length {@code shadowRadius} around the surface {@link SurfaceControl}.
          * If the length is 0.0f then the shadows will not be drawn.
          *
          * Shadows are drawn around the screen bounds, these are the post transformed cropped
          * bounds. They can draw over their parent bounds and will be occluded by layers with a
          * higher z-order. The shadows will respect the surface's corner radius if the
          * rounded corner bounds (transformed source bounds) are within the screen bounds.
          *
          * A shadow will only be drawn on buffer and color layers. If the radius is applied on a
          * container layer, it will be passed down the hierarchy to be applied on buffer and color
          * layers but not its children. A scenario where this is useful is when SystemUI animates
          * a task by controlling a leash to it, can draw a shadow around the app surface by
          * setting a shadow on the leash. This is similar to how rounded corners are set.
