     * Add a standalone chunk to the {@code WHERE} clause of this query.
     * <p>
     * This method differs from {@link #appendWhere(CharSequence)} in that it
     * automatically appends {@code AND} to any existing {@code WHERE} clause
     * already under construction before appending the given standalone
     * expression wrapped in parentheses.
     *
     * @param inWhere the standalone expression to append to the {@code WHERE}
     *            clause. It will be wrapped in parentheses when it's appended.
