     * Informs the system of an intentional upcoming carrier network change by a carrier app.
     * This call only used to allow the system to provide alternative UI while telephony is
     * performing an action that may result in intentional, temporary network lack of connectivity.
     * <p>
     * Based on the active parameter passed in, this method will either show or hide the alternative
     * UI. There is no timeout associated with showing this UX, so a carrier app must be sure to
     * call with active set to false sometime after calling with it set to {@code true}.
     * <p>
     * Requires Permission: calling app has carrier privileges.
     *
     * @param active Whether the carrier network change is or shortly will be
     * active. Set this value to true to begin showing alternative UI and false to stop.
     * @see TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges
