     * Used to determine if a particular package has been registered as a Device Owner app.
     * A device owner app is a special device admin that cannot be deactivated by the user, once
     * activated as a device admin. It also cannot be uninstalled. To check whether a particular
     * package is currently registered as the device owner app, pass in the package name from
     * {@link Context#getPackageName()} to this method.<p/>This is useful for device
     * admin apps that want to check whether they are also registered as the device owner app. The
     * exact mechanism by which a device admin app is registered as a device owner app is defined by
     * the setup process.
     * @param packageName the package name of the app, to compare with the registered device owner
     * app, if any.
     * @return whether or not the package is registered as the device owner app.
