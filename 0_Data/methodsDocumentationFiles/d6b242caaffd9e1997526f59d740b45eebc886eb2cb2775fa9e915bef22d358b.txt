     * For each of the packages defined in {@code previousCrossProfilePackages} but not included in
     * {@code newCrossProfilePackages}, resets the app-op for {@link android.Manifest.permission
     * #INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES} back to its default value if it can no longer be configured by
     * users in Settings, as defined by {@link #canConfigureInteractAcrossProfiles(String)}.
     *
     * <p>This method should be used whenever an app's ability to interact across profiles could
     * have changed as a result of non-user actions, such as changes to admin or OEM consent
     * whitelists.
     *
     * <p>If the caller does not have the {@link android.Manifest.permission
     * #CONFIGURE_INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES} permission, then they must have the permissions that
     * would have been required to call {@link android.app.AppOpsManager#setMode(int, int, String,
     * int)}, which includes {@link android.Manifest.permission#MANAGE_APP_OPS_MODES}.
     *
     * <p>Also requires either {@link android.Manifest.permission#INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS} or {@link
     * android.Manifest.permission#INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL}.
