     * Return the UTC time of this fix, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
     *
     * <p>Note that the UTC time on a device is not monotonic: it
     * can jump forwards or backwards unpredictably. So always use
     * {@link #getElapsedRealtimeNanos} when calculating time deltas.
     *
     * <p>On the other hand, {@link #getTime} is useful for presenting
     * a human readable time to the user, or for carefully comparing
     * location fixes across reboot or across devices.
     *
     * <p>All locations generated by the {@link LocationManager}
     * are guaranteed to have a valid UTC time, however remember that
     * the system time may have changed since the location was generated.
     *
     * @return time of fix, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
