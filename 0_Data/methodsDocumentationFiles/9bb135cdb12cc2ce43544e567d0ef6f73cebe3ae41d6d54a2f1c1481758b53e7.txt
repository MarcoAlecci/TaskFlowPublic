     * Callback invoked when device service state changes on the registered subscription.
     * Note, the registration subId comes from {@link TelephonyManager} object which registers
     * PhoneStateListener by {@link TelephonyManager#listen(PhoneStateListener, int)}.
     * If this TelephonyManager object was created with
     * {@link TelephonyManager#createForSubscriptionId(int)}, then the callback applies to the
     * subId. Otherwise, this callback applies to
     * {@link SubscriptionManager#getDefaultSubscriptionId()}.
     *
     * The instance of {@link ServiceState} passed as an argument here will have various levels of
     * location information stripped from it depending on the location permissions that your app
     * holds. Only apps holding the {@link Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} permission will
     * receive all the information in {@link ServiceState}.
