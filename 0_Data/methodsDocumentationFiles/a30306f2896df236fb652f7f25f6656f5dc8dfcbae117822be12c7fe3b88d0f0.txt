     * Dispatch a pointer event. Finished at some point after the recipient has
     * returned from its event processing, though it may <em>not</em> have
     * completely finished reacting from the event -- for example, if it needs
     * to update its display as a result, it may still be in the process of
     * doing that.
     * 
     * @param event A motion event describing the pointer action.  (As noted in 
     * {@link MotionEvent#obtain(long, long, int, float, float, int)}, be sure to use 
     * {@link SystemClock#uptimeMillis()} as the timebase.
