         * not this one grants it the provided capability, represented by the {@code flags}
         * parameter.  In the event of signing certificate rotation, a package may still interact
         * with entities signed by its old signing certificate and not want to break previously
         * functioning behavior.  The {@code flags} value determines which capabilities the app

         * signing certificate(s).
