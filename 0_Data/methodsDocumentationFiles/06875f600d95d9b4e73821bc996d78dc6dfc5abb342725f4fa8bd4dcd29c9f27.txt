     * Convenience method to animate, using the default transition,
     * to a new scene defined by all changes within the given scene root between
     * calling this method and the next rendering frame.
     * Equivalent to calling {@link #beginDelayedTransition(ViewGroup, Transition)}
     * with a value of <code>null</code> for the <code>transition</code> parameter.
     *
     * @param sceneRoot The root of the View hierarchy to run the transition on.
