     * Draw the specified arc, which will be scaled to fit inside the specified oval.

     * If the start angle is negative or >= 360, the start angle is treated as start angle modulo
     * 360.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the sweep angle is >= 360, then the oval is drawn completely. Note that this differs
     * slightly from SkPath::arcTo, which treats the sweep angle modulo 360. If the sweep angle is
     * negative, the sweep angle is treated as sweep angle modulo 360
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The arc is drawn clockwise. An angle of 0 degrees correspond to the geometric angle of 0
     * degrees (3 o'clock on a watch.)

     * @param oval The bounds of oval used to define the shape and size of the arc
     * @param startAngle Starting angle (in degrees) where the arc begins
     * @param sweepAngle Sweep angle (in degrees) measured clockwise
     * @param useCenter If true, include the center of the oval in the arc, and close it if it is
     *            being stroked. This will draw a wedge
     * @param paint The paint used to draw the arc
