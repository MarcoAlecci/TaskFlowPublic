         *  will not affect the decode, though it will still set mCancel.

         *  In {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M} and below, if this can
         *  be called from another thread while this options object is inside
         *  a decode... call. Calling this will notify the decoder that it
         *  should cancel its operation. This is not guaranteed to cancel the
         *  decode, but if it does, the decoder... operation will return null,
         *  or if inJustDecodeBounds is true, will set outWidth/outHeight
         *  to -1
