     * Controls the modal density of the late reverberation decay.
     * <p> The scale should approximately map linearly to the perceived change in reverberation.
     * A lower density creates a hollow sound that is useful for simulating small reverberation
     * spaces such as bathrooms.
     * @param density density specified using a permille scale. The valid range is [0, 1000].
     * A value of 1000 o/oo indicates a natural sounding reverberation. Values below this level
     * produce a more colored effect.
     * @throws IllegalStateException
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException
