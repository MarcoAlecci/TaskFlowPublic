     * Sets a listener for the transact method on the proxy-side.
     *
     * <li>The listener is global. Only fast operations should be done to avoid thread
     * contentions.
     * <li>The listener implementation needs to handle synchronization if needed. The methods on the
     * listener can be called concurrently.
     * <li>Listener set will be used for new transactions. On-going transaction will still use the
     * previous listener (if already set).
     * <li>The listener is called on the critical path of the binder transaction so be careful about
     * performance.
     * <li>Never execute another binder transaction inside the listener.
