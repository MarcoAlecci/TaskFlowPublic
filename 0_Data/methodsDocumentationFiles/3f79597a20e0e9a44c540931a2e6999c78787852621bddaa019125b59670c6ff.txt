         * This method is called when an image capture makes partial forward progress; some
         * (but not all) results from an image capture are available.
         *
         * <p>The result provided here will contain some subset of the fields of
         * a full result. Multiple {@link #onCaptureProgressed} calls may happen per
         * capture; a given result field will only be present in one partial
         * capture at most. The final {@link #onCaptureCompleted} call will always
         * contain all the fields (in particular, the union of all the fields of all
         * the partial results composing the total result).</p>
         *
         * <p>For each request, some result data might be available earlier than others. The typical
         * delay between each partial result (per request) is a single frame interval.
         * For performance-oriented use-cases, applications should query the metadata they need
         * to make forward progress from the partial results and avoid waiting for the completed
         * result.</p>
         *
         * <p>For a particular request, {@link #onCaptureProgressed} may happen before or after
         * {@link #onCaptureStarted}.</p>
         *
         * <p>Each request will generate at least {@code 1} partial results, and at most
         * {@link CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_PARTIAL_RESULT_COUNT} partial results.</p>
         *
         * <p>Depending on the request settings, the number of partial results per request
         * will vary, although typically the partial count could be the same as long as the
         * camera device subsystems enabled stay the same.</p>
         *
         * <p>The default implementation of this method does nothing.</p>
