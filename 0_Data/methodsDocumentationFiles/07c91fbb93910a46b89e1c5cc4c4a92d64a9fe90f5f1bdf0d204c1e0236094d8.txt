         * Some codecs have a limit on the smaller dimension, whether it be
         * the width or the height.  E.g. a codec may only be able to handle
         * up to 1920x1080 both in landscape and portrait mode (1080x1920).
         * In this case the maximum width and height are both 1920, but the
         * smaller dimension limit will be 1080. For other codecs, this is
         * {@code Math.min(getSupportedWidths().getUpper(),
         * getSupportedHeights().getUpper())}.
