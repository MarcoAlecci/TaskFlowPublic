     * Sets the behavior for overlapping rendering for this view (see {@link
     * #hasOverlappingRendering()} for more details on this behavior). Calling this method
     * is an alternative to overriding {@link #hasOverlappingRendering()} in a subclass,
     * providing the value which is then used internally. That is, when {@link
     * #forceHasOverlappingRendering(boolean)} is called, the value of {@link
     * #hasOverlappingRendering()} is ignored and the value passed into this method is used
     * instead.
     *
     * @param hasOverlappingRendering The value for overlapping rendering to be used internally
     * instead of that returned by {@link #hasOverlappingRendering()}.
