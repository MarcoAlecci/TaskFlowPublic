     * Sets the video encoding bit rate for recording. Call this method before prepare().
     * Prepare() may perform additional checks on the parameter to make sure whether the
     * specified bit rate is applicable, and sometimes the passed bitRate will be
     * clipped internally to ensure the video recording can proceed smoothly based on
     * the capabilities of the platform.
     *
     * @param bitRate the video encoding bit rate in bits per second.
