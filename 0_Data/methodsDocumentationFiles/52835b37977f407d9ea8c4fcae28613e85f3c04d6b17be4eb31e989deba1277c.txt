     * <p>Computes the chromatic adaptation transform from the specified
     * source white point to the specified destination white point.</p>
     *
     * <p>The transform is computed using the von Kries method, described
     * in more details in the documentation of {@link Adaptation}. The
     * {@link Adaptation} enum provides different matrices that can be
     * used to perform the adaptation.</p>
