     * The controller number for a given input device.
     * <p>
     * Each gamepad or joystick is given a unique, positive controller number when initially
     * configured by the system. This number may change due to events such as device disconnects /
     * reconnects or user initiated reassignment. Any change in number will trigger an event that
     * can be observed by registering an {@link InputManager.InputDeviceListener}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * All input devices which are not gamepads or joysticks will be assigned a controller number
     * of 0.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return The controller number of the device.
