     * Perform Hermite interpolation between two values.
     * Eg:
     *   smoothStep(0, 0.5f, 0.5f) = 1f
     *   smoothStep(0, 0.5f, 0.25f) = 0.5f
     *
     * @param start Left edge.
     * @param end Right edge.
     * @param x A value between {@code start} and {@code end}.
     * @return A number between 0 and 1 representing where {@code x} is in the interpolation.
