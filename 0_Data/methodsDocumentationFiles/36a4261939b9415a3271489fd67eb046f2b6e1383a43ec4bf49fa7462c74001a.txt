     * Returns an interpolated angle in degrees between a set of start and end
     * angles.
     * <p>
     * Unlike {@link #lerp(float, float, float)}, the direction and distance of
     * travel is determined by the shortest angle between the start and end
     * angles. For example, if the starting angle is 0 and the ending angle is
     * 350, then the interpolated angle will be in the range [0,-10] rather
     * than [0,350].
     *
     * @param start the starting angle in degrees
     * @param end the ending angle in degrees
     * @param amount the position between start and end in the range [0,1]
     *               where 0 is the starting angle and 1 is the ending angle
     * @return the interpolated angle in degrees
