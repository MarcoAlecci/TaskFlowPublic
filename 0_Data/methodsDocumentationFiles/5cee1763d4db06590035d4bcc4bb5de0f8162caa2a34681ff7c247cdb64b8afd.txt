     * Make note of an application performing an operation on behalf of another application when
     * handling an IPC. This function will verify that the calling uid and proxied package name
     * match, and if not, return {@link #MODE_IGNORED}. If this call succeeds, the last execution
     * time of the operation for the proxied app and your app will be updated to the current time.
     *
     * @param op The operation to note. One of the OPSTR_* constants.
     * @param proxiedPackageName The name of the application calling into the proxy application.
     * @param proxiedUid The uid of the proxied application
     * @param proxiedAttributionTag The proxied {@link Context#createAttributionContext
     * attribution tag} or {@code null} for default attribution
     * @param message A message describing the reason the op was noted
     *
     * @return Returns {@link #MODE_ALLOWED} if the operation is allowed, or {@link #MODE_IGNORED}
     * if it is not allowed and should be silently ignored (without causing the app to crash).
     *
     * @throws SecurityException If the proxy or proxied app has been configured to crash on this
     * op.
