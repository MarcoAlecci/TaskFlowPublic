     * <strong>Note:</strong> Calling this method with a software canvas when the
     * AnimatedVectorDrawable is being animated on RenderThread (for API 25 and later) may yield
     * outdated result, as the UI thread is not guaranteed to be in sync with RenderThread on
     * VectorDrawable's property changes during RenderThread animations.
