     * Returns the index within the given char sequence that is offset
     * from the given {@code index} by {@code codePointOffset}
     * code points. Unpaired surrogates within the text range given by
     * {@code index} and {@code codePointOffset} count as
     * one code point each.
     *
     * @param seq the char sequence
     * @param index the index to be offset
     * @param codePointOffset the offset in code points
     * @return the index within the char sequence
     * @exception NullPointerException if {@code seq} is null.
     * @exception IndexOutOfBoundsException if {@code index}
     *   is negative or larger then the length of the char sequence,
     *   or if {@code codePointOffset} is positive and the
     *   subsequence starting with {@code index} has fewer than
     *   {@code codePointOffset} code points, or if
     *   {@code codePointOffset} is negative and the subsequence
     *   before {@code index} has fewer than the absolute value
     *   of {@code codePointOffset} code points.
