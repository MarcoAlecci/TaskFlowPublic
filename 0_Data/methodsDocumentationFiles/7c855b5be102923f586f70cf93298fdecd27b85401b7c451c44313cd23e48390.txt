         * Disables autofill for the app or activity.
         *
         * <p>This method is useful to optimize performance in cases where the service knows it
         * can not autofill an app&mdash;for example, when the service has a list of "blacklisted"
         * apps such as office suites.
         *
         * <p>By default, it disables autofill for all activities in the app, unless the response is
         * {@link #setFlags(int) flagged} with {@link #FLAG_DISABLE_ACTIVITY_ONLY}.
         *
         * <p>Autofill for the app or activity is automatically re-enabled after any of the
         * following conditions:
         *
         * <ol>
         *   <li>{@code duration} milliseconds have passed.
         *   <li>The autofill service for the user has changed.
         *   <li>The device has rebooted.
         * </ol>
         *
         * <p><b>Note:</b> Activities that are running when autofill is re-enabled remain
         * disabled for autofill until they finish and restart.
         *
         * @param duration duration to disable autofill, in milliseconds.
         *
         * @return this builder
         *
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code duration} is not a positive number.
         * @throws IllegalStateException if either {@link #addDataset(Dataset)},
