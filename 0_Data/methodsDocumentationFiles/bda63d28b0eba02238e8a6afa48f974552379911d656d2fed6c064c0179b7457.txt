     * Return the primary shared/external storage directory. This directory may
     * not currently be accessible if it has been mounted by the user on their
     * computer, has been removed from the device, or some other problem has
     * happened. You can determine its current state with
     * {@link #getExternalStorageState()}.
     * <p>
     * <em>Note: don't be confused by the word "external" here. This directory
     * can better be thought as media/shared storage. It is a filesystem that
     * can hold a relatively large amount of data and that is shared across all
     * applications (does not enforce permissions). Traditionally this is an SD
     * card, but it may also be implemented as built-in storage in a device that
     * is distinct from the protected internal storage and can be mounted as a
     * filesystem on a computer.</em>
     * <p>
     * On devices with multiple users (as described by {@link UserManager}),
     * each user has their own isolated shared storage. Applications only have
     * access to the shared storage for the user they're running as.
     * <p>
     * In devices with multiple shared/external storage directories, this
     * directory represents the primary storage that the user will interact
     * with. Access to secondary storage is available through
     * {@link Context#getExternalFilesDirs(String)},
     * {@link Context#getExternalCacheDirs()}, and
     * {@link Context#getExternalMediaDirs()}.
     * <p>
     * Applications should not directly use this top-level directory, in order
     * to avoid polluting the user's root namespace. Any files that are private
     * to the application should be placed in a directory returned by
     * {@link android.content.Context#getExternalFilesDir
     * Context.getExternalFilesDir}, which the system will take care of deleting
     * if the application is uninstalled. Other shared files should be placed in
     * one of the directories returned by
     * {@link #getExternalStoragePublicDirectory}.
     * <p>
     * Writing to this path requires the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} permission,
     * and starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, read
     * access requires the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} permission,
     * which is automatically granted if you hold the write permission.
     * <p>
     * Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, if your
     * application only needs to store internal data, consider using
     * {@link Context#getExternalFilesDir(String)},
     * {@link Context#getExternalCacheDir()}, or
     * {@link Context#getExternalMediaDirs()}, which require no permissions to
     * read or write.
     * <p>
     * This path may change between platform versions, so applications should
     * only persist relative paths.
     * <p>
     * Here is an example of typical code to monitor the state of external
     * storage:
     * <p>
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/content/ExternalStorage.java
     * monitor_storage}
     *
     * @see #getExternalStorageState()
     * @see #isExternalStorageRemovable()
     * @deprecated To improve user privacy, direct access to shared/external
     *             storage devices is deprecated. When an app targets
     *             {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}, the path returned
     *             from this method is no longer directly accessible to apps.
     *             Apps can continue to access content stored on shared/external
     *             storage by migrating to alternatives such as
     *             {@link Context#getExternalFilesDir(String)},
     *             {@link MediaStore}, or {@link Intent#ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT}.
