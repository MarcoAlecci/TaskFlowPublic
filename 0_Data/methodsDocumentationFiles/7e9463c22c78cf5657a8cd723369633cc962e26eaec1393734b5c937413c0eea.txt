     * This method creates an animation that will be run for this transition
     * given the information in the startValues and endValues structures captured
     * earlier for the start and end scenes. Subclasses of Transition should override
     * this method. The method should only be called by the transition system; it is
     * not intended to be called from external classes.
     *
     * <p>This method is called by the transition's parent (all the way up to the
     * topmost Transition in the hierarchy) with the sceneRoot and start/end
     * values that the transition may need to set up initial target values
     * and construct an appropriate animation. For example, if an overall
     * Transition is a {@link TransitionSet} consisting of several
     * child transitions in sequence, then some of the child transitions may
     * want to set initial values on target views prior to the overall
     * Transition commencing, to put them in an appropriate state for the
     * delay between that start and the child Transition start time. For
     * example, a transition that fades an item in may wish to set the starting
     * alpha value to 0, to avoid it blinking in prior to the transition
     * actually starting the animation. This is necessary because the scene
     * change that triggers the Transition will automatically set the end-scene
     * on all target views, so a Transition that wants to animate from a
     * different value should set that value prior to returning from this method.</p>
     *
     * <p>Additionally, a Transition can perform logic to determine whether
     * the transition needs to run on the given target and start/end values.
     * For example, a transition that resizes objects on the screen may wish
     * to avoid running for views which are not present in either the start
     * or end scenes.</p>
     *
     * <p>If there is an animator created and returned from this method, the
     * transition mechanism will apply any applicable duration, startDelay,
     * and interpolator to that animation and start it. A return value of
     * <code>null</code> indicates that no animation should run. The default
     * implementation returns null.</p>
     *
     * <p>The method is called for every applicable target object, which is
     * stored in the {@link TransitionValues#view} field.</p>

     * @param sceneRoot The root of the transition hierarchy.
     * @param startValues The values for a specific target in the start scene.
     * @param endValues The values for the target in the end scene.
     * @return A Animator to be started at the appropriate time in the
     * overall transition for this scene change. A null value means no animation
     * should be run.
