     * Set the locale list. This is the preferred way for setting up the locales (instead of using
     * the direct accessor or {@link #setLocale(Locale)}). This will also set the layout direction
     * according to the first locale in the list.
     *
     * Note that the layout direction will always come from the first locale in the locale list,
     * even if the locale is not supported by the resources (the resources may only support
     * another locale further down the list which has a different direction).
     *
     * @param locales The locale list. If null, an empty LocaleList will be assigned.
