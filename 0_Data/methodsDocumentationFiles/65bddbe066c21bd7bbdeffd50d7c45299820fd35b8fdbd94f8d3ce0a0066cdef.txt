     * Overrides the carrier config of the provided subscription ID with the provided values.
     *
     * Any further queries to carrier config from any process will return the overridden values
     * after this method returns. The overrides are effective until the user passes in {@code null}
     * for {@code overrideValues}. This removes all previous overrides and sets the carrier config
     * back to production values.
     *
     * The overrides is stored persistently and will survive a reboot if {@code persistent} is true.
     *
     * May throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException} if {@code overrideValues} contains invalid
     * values for the specified config keys.

     *                       {@code null}, this will remove all previous overrides and set the
     *                       carrier configuration back to production values.
     * @param persistent     Determines whether the override should be persistent.
