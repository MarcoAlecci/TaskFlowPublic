     * Creates a new bitmap, scaled from an existing bitmap, when possible. If the
     * specified width and height are the same as the current width and height of
     * the source bitmap, the source bitmap is returned and no new bitmap is
     * created.
     *
     * @param src       The source bitmap.
     * @param dstWidth  The new bitmap's desired width.
     * @param dstHeight The new bitmap's desired height.
     * @param filter    Whether or not bilinear filtering should be used when scaling the
     *                  bitmap. If this is true then bilinear filtering will be used when
     *                  scaling which has better image quality at the cost of worse performance.
     *                  If this is false then nearest-neighbor scaling is used instead which
     *                  will have worse image quality but is faster. Recommended default
     *                  is to set filter to 'true' as the cost of bilinear filtering is
     *                  typically minimal and the improved image quality is significant.
     * @return The new scaled bitmap or the source bitmap if no scaling is required.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if width is <= 0, or height is <= 0
