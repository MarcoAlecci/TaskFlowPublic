     * Disable NDEF message push over P2P.
     *
     * <p>After calling {@link #enableForegroundNdefPush}, an activity
     * must call this method before its {@link Activity#onPause} callback
     * completes.
     *
     * <p>Strongly recommend to use the new {@link #setNdefPushMessage}
     * instead: it automatically hooks into your activity life-cycle,
     * so you do not need to call enable/disable in your onResume/onPause.
     *
     * <p>This method must be called from the main thread.
     *
     * <p class="note">Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#NFC} permission.
     *
     * @param activity the Foreground activity
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the Activity has already been paused
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if FEATURE_NFC is unavailable.
     * @deprecated use {@link #setNdefPushMessage} instead
