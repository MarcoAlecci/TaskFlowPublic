     * A convenience wrapper that takes the current {@link ThreadPolicy} from {@link
     * #getThreadPolicy}, modifies it to permit disk reads, and sets the new policy with {@link
     * #setThreadPolicy}, returning the old policy so you can restore it at the end of a block.
     *
     * @return the old policy, to be passed to setThreadPolicy to restore the policy.
