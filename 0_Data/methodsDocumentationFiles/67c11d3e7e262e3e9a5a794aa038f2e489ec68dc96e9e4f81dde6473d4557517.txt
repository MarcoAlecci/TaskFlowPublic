         * <p>If true, GNSS chipset switches off duty cycling. In such a mode, no clock
         * discontinuities are expected, and when supported, carrier phase should be continuous in
         * good signal conditions. All non-blacklisted, healthy constellations, satellites and
         * frequency bands that the chipset supports must be reported in this mode. The GNSS chipset
         * is allowed to consume more power in this mode. If false, GNSS chipset optimizes power via
         * duty cycling, constellations and frequency limits, etc.
         *
         * <p>Full tracking requests always override non-full tracking requests. If any full
         * tracking request occurs, all listeners on the device will receive full tracking GNSS
         * measurements.
