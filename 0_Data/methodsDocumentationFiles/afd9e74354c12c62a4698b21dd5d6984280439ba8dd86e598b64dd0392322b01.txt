     * Set a hint to the system about whether this fragment's UI is currently visible
     * to the user. This hint defaults to true and is persistent across fragment instance
     * state save and restore.
     *
     * <p>An app may set this to false to indicate that the fragment's UI is
     * scrolled out of visibility or is otherwise not directly visible to the user.
     * This may be used by the system to prioritize operations such as fragment lifecycle updates
     * or loader ordering behavior.</p>
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This method may be called outside of the fragment lifecycle
     * and thus has no ordering guarantees with regard to fragment lifecycle method calls.</p>
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Prior to Android N there was a platform bug that could cause
     * <code>setUserVisibleHint</code> to bring a fragment up to the started state before its
     * <code>FragmentTransaction</code> had been committed. As some apps relied on this behavior,
     * it is preserved for apps that declare a <code>targetSdkVersion</code> of 23 or lower.</p>
     *
     * @param isVisibleToUser true if this fragment's UI is currently visible to the user (default),
     *                        false if it is not.
