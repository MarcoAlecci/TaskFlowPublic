     * The ImsService has been bound and is ready for ImsFeature creation based on the Features that
     * the ImsService has registered for with the framework, either in the manifest or via
     * {@link #querySupportedImsFeatures()}.
     *
     * The ImsService should use this signal instead of onCreate/onBind or similar to perform
     * feature initialization because the framework may bind to this service multiple times to
     * query the ImsService's {@link ImsFeatureConfiguration} via
     * {@link #querySupportedImsFeatures()}before creating features.
