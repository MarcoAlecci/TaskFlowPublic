     * <p>Create a unmodifiable list of requests that is suitable for constrained high speed capture
     * session streaming.</p>
     *
     * <p>High speed video streaming creates significant performance pressure on the camera device,
     * so to achieve efficient high speed streaming, the camera device may have to aggregate
     * multiple frames together. This means requests must be sent in batched groups, with all
     * requests sharing the same settings. This method takes the list of output target
     * Surfaces (subject to the output Surface requirements specified by the constrained high speed
     * session) and a {@link CaptureRequest request}, and generates a request list that has the same
     * controls for each request. The input {@link CaptureRequest request} must contain the target
     * output Surfaces and target high speed FPS range that is one of the
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getHighSpeedVideoFpsRangesFor} for the Surface size.</p>
     *
     * <p>If both preview and recording Surfaces are specified in the {@code request}, the
     * {@link CaptureRequest#CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE target FPS range} in the input
     * {@link CaptureRequest request} must be a fixed frame rate FPS range, where the
     * {@link android.util.Range#getLower minimal FPS} ==
     * {@link android.util.Range#getUpper() maximum FPS}. The created request list will contain
     * a interleaved request pattern such that the preview output FPS is at least 30fps, the
     * recording output FPS is {@link android.util.Range#getUpper() maximum FPS} of the requested
     * FPS range. The application can submit this request list directly to an active high speed
     * capture session to achieve high speed video recording. When only preview or recording
     * Surface is specified, this method will return a list of request that have the same controls
     * and output targets for all requests.</p>
     *
     * <p>Submitting a request list created by this method to a normal capture session will result
     * in an {@link IllegalArgumentException} if the high speed
     * {@link CaptureRequest#CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE FPS range} is not supported by
     * {@link CameraCharacteristics#CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES}.</p>
     *
     * @param request The high speed capture request that will be used to generate the high speed
     *                request list.
     * @return A unmodifiable CaptureRequest list that is suitable for constrained high speed
     *         capture.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the set of output Surfaces in the request do not meet the
     *                                  high speed video capability requirements, or the camera
     *                                  device doesn't support high speed video capability, or the
     *                                  request doesn't meet the high speed video capability
     *                                  requirements, or the request doesn't contain the required
     *                                  controls for high speed capture.
     * @throws CameraAccessException if the camera device is no longer connected or has
     *                               encountered a fatal error
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the camera device has been closed
