     * Prepare an item view for use. See AdapterView for the basic idea at work here.
     * This may require creating a new item view, but well-behaved implementations will
     * re-use the view passed as convertView if present. The returned view will be populated
     * with data from the item parameter.
     *
     * @param item Item to present
     * @param convertView Existing view to reuse
     * @param parent Intended parent view - use for inflation.
     * @return View that presents the requested menu item
