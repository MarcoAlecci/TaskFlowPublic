     * Return the UserHandle assigned to the process that sent you the
     * current transaction that is being processed.  This is the user
     * of the caller.  It is distinct from {@link #getCallingUid()} in that a
     * particular user will have multiple distinct apps running under it each
     * with their own uid.  If the current thread is not currently executing an
     * incoming transaction, then its own UserHandle is returned.
