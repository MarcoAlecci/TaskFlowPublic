     * Returns true if this view is focusable or if it contains a reachable View
     * for which {@link #hasExplicitFocusable()} returns {@code true}.
     * A "reachable hasExplicitFocusable()" is a view whose parents do not block descendants focus.
     * Only {@link #VISIBLE} views for which {@link #getFocusable()} would return
     * {@link #FOCUSABLE} are considered focusable.
     *
     * <p>This method preserves the pre-{@link Build.VERSION_CODES#O} behavior of
     * {@link #hasFocusable()} in that only views explicitly set focusable will cause
     * this method to return true. A view set to {@link #FOCUSABLE_AUTO} that resolves
     * to focusable will not.</p>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the view is focusable or if the view contains a focusable
     *         view, {@code false} otherwise
