     * Use the 5G NR Non-Standalone indicators from the network registration state to update the
     * NR state. There are 3 indicators in the network registration state:
     *
     * 1. if E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) is supported by the primary serving cell.
     * 2. if NR is supported by the selected PLMN.
     * 3. if the use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted.
     *
     * The network has 5G NR capability if E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity is supported by the primary
     * serving cell.
     *
     * The use of NR 5G is not restricted If the network has 5G NR capability and both the use of
     * DCNR is not restricted and NR is supported by the selected PLMN. Otherwise the use of 5G
     * NR is restricted.
