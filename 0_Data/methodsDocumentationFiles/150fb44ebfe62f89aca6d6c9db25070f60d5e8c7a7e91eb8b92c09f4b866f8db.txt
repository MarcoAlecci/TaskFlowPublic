     * <p>Determine if this request is part of a constrained high speed request list that was
     * created by
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession#createHighSpeedRequestList}.
     * A constrained high speed request list contains some constrained high speed capture requests
     * with certain interleaved pattern that is suitable for high speed preview/video streaming. An
     * active constrained high speed capture session only accepts constrained high speed request
     * lists.  This method can be used to do the correctness check when a constrained high speed
     * capture session receives a request list via {@link CameraCaptureSession#setRepeatingBurst} or
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession#captureBurst}.  </p>
     *
     *
     * @return {@code true} if this request is part of a constrained high speed request list,
     * {@code false} otherwise.
