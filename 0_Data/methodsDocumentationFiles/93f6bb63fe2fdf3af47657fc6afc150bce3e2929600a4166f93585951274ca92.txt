     * this may take a little while, the result will be posted back to the given observer. A
     * deletion will fail if the calling context lacks the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#DELETE_CACHE_FILES} permission, if the named package
     * cannot be found, or if the named package is a "system package". If {@code userId} does not
     * belong to the calling user, the caller must have
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS} permission.
     *
