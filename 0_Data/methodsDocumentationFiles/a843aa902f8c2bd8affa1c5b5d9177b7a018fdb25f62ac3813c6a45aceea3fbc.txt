             * Enables detection of mismatches between defined resource types and getter calls.

             * <p>This helps detect accidental type mismatches and potentially expensive type
             * conversions when obtaining typed resources.
             *
             * <p>For example, a strict mode violation would be thrown when calling {@link
             * android.content.res.TypedArray#getInt(int, int)} on an index that contains a
             * String-type resource. If the string value can be parsed as an integer, this method
             * call will return a value without crashing; however, the developer should format the
             * resource as an integer to avoid unnecessary type conversion.
