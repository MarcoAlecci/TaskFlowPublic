     * Calculate and apply adjustments to captured statistics for 464xlat traffic.
     *
     * <p>This mutates stacked traffic stats, to account for IPv4/IPv6 header size difference.
     *
     * <p>UID stats, which are only accounted on the stacked interface, need to be increased
     * by 20 bytes/packet to account for translation overhead.
     *
     * <p>The potential additional overhead of 8 bytes/packet for ip fragments is ignored.
     *
     * <p>Interface stats need to sum traffic on both stacked and base interface because:
     *   - eBPF offloaded packets appear only on the stacked interface
     *   - Non-offloaded ingress packets appear only on the stacked interface
     *     (due to iptables raw PREROUTING drop rules)
     *   - Non-offloaded egress packets appear only on the stacked interface
     *     (due to ignoring traffic from clat daemon by uid match)
     * (and of course the 20 bytes/packet overhead needs to be applied to stacked interface stats)
     *
     * <p>This method will behave fine if {@code stackedIfaces} is an non-synchronized but add-only
     * {@code ConcurrentHashMap}
     * @param baseTraffic Traffic on the base interfaces. Will be mutated.
     * @param stackedTraffic Stats with traffic stacked on top of our ifaces. Will also be mutated.
     * @param stackedIfaces Mapping ipv6if -> ipv4if interface where traffic is counted on both.
