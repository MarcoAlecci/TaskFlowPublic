     * Writes out the string to the underlying output stream as a
     * sequence of bytes. Each character in the string is written out, in
     * sequence, by discarding its high eight bits. If no exception is
     * thrown, the counter <code>written</code> is incremented by the
     * length of <code>s</code>.
     *
     * @param      s   a string of bytes to be written.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
     * @see        java.io.FilterOutputStream#out
