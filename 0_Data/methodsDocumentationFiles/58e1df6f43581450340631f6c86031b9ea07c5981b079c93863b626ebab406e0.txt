     * Sets or forgets a saved password. This modifies the local copy of the
     * password used to automatically authenticate the user; it does not change
     * the user's account password on the server. Intended for use by the
     * authenticator, not directly by applications.
     * <p>Calling this method does not update the last authenticated timestamp,
     * referred by {@link #KEY_LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME}. To update it, call
     * {@link #notifyAccountAuthenticated(Account)} after getting success.
     * <p>It is safe to call this method from the main thread.
     * <p>This method requires the caller to have a signature match with the
     * authenticator that manages the specified account.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If targeting your app to work on API level 22 and before,
     * AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS permission and same UID as account's authenticator
     * is needed for those platforms. See docs for this function in API level 22.
     *
     * @param account The account whose password is to be set. Cannot be
     *            {@code null}.
     * @param password The password to set, null to clear the password
