     * This method is called by ViewGroup when a child view is about to be added to the
     * container. This callback starts the process of a transition; we grab the starting
     * values, listen for changes to all of the children of the container, and start appropriate
     * animations.
     *
     * @param parent The ViewGroup to which the View is being added.
     * @param child The View being added to the ViewGroup.
