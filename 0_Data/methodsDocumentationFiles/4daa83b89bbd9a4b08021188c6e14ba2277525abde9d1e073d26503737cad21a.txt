     * The default implementation of this method returns a null Animator. Subclasses should
     * override this method to make targets appear with the desired transition. The
     * method should only be called from
     * {@link #onAppear(ViewGroup, TransitionValues, int, TransitionValues, int)}.
     *
     * @param sceneRoot The root of the transition hierarchy
     * @param view The View to make appear. This will be in the target scene's View hierarchy and
     *             will be VISIBLE.
     * @param startValues The target values in the start scene
     * @param endValues The target values in the end scene
     * @return An Animator to be started at the appropriate time in the
     * overall transition for this scene change. A null value means no animation
     * should be run.
