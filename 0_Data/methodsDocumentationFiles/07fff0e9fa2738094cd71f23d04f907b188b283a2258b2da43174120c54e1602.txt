     * Utility to reconcile a desired size and state, with constraints imposed
     * by a MeasureSpec. Will take the desired size, unless a different size
     * is imposed by the constraints. The returned value is a compound integer,
     * with the resolved size in the {@link #MEASURED_SIZE_MASK} bits and
     * optionally the bit {@link #MEASURED_STATE_TOO_SMALL} set if the
     * resulting size is smaller than the size the view wants to be.
     *
     * @param size How big the view wants to be.
     * @param measureSpec Constraints imposed by the parent.
     * @param childMeasuredState Size information bit mask for the view's
     *                           children.
     * @return Size information bit mask as defined by
     *         {@link #MEASURED_SIZE_MASK} and
     *         {@link #MEASURED_STATE_TOO_SMALL}.
