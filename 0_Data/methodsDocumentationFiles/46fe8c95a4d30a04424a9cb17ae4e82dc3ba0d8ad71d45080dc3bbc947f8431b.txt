     * Changes the activated state of this view. A view can be activated or not.
     * Note that activation is not the same as selection.  Selection is
     * a transient property, representing the view (hierarchy) the user is
     * currently interacting with.  Activation is a longer-term state that the
     * user can move views in and out of.  For example, in a list view with
     * single or multiple selection enabled, the views in the current selection
     * set are activated.  (Um, yeah, we are deeply sorry about the terminology
     * here.)  The activated state is propagated down to children of the view it
     * is set on.
     *
     * @param activated true if the view must be activated, false otherwise
