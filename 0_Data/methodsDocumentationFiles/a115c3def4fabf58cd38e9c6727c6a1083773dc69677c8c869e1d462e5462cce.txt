         * Called when the framework connects to a new network to evaluate whether it satisfies this
         * request. If evaluation succeeds, this callback may be followed by an {@link #onAvailable}
         * callback. There is no guarantee that this new network will satisfy any requests, or that
         * the network will stay connected for longer than the time necessary to evaluate it.
         * <p>
         * Most applications <b>should not</b> act on this callback, and should instead use
         * {@link #onAvailable}. This callback is intended for use by applications that can assist
         * the framework in properly evaluating the network &mdash; for example, an application that
         * can automatically log in to a captive portal without user intervention.
         *
         * @param network The {@link Network} of the network that is being evaluated.
