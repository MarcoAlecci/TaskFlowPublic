     * Copies a byte-array into a new Ashmem region and return it as HidlMemory.
     * The returned instance owns the underlying file descriptors, and the client should generally
     * call close on it when no longer in use (or otherwise, when the object gets destroyed it will
     * be closed).
     *
     * @param input The input byte array.
     * @param name  An optional name for the ashmem region.
     * @return A HidlMemory instance, containing a copy of the input.
