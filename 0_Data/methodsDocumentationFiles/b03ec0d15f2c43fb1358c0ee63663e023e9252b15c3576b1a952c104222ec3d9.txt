     * <p>In many cases the supplied title for an action mode is merely
     * meant to add context and is not strictly required for the action
     * mode to be useful. If the title is optional, the system may choose
     * to hide the title entirely rather than truncate it due to a lack
     * of available space.</p>

     * may choose to ignore this setting under some circumstances.</p>
