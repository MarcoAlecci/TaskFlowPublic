     * Parses the "intent" element (and its children) from XML and instantiates
     * an Intent object.  The given XML parser should be located at the tag
     * where parsing should start (often named "intent"), from which the
     * basic action, data, type, and package and class name will be
     * retrieved.  The function will then parse in to any child elements,
     * looking for <category android:name="xxx"> tags to add categories and
     * <extra android:name="xxx" android:value="yyy"> to attach extra data
     * to the intent.
     *
     * @param resources The Resources to use when inflating resources.
     * @param parser The XML parser pointing at an "intent" tag.
     * @param attrs The AttributeSet interface for retrieving extended
     * attribute data at the current <var>parser</var> location.
     * @return An Intent object matching the XML data.
     * @throws XmlPullParserException If there was an XML parsing error.
     * @throws IOException If there was an I/O error.
