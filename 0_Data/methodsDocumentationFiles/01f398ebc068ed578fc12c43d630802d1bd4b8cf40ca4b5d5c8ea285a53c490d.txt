         * Total Swap in KB.
         * Notes:
         *  * Some of this memory belongs in other categories, but we don't
         *    know if the Swap memory is shared or private, so we don't know
         *    what to blame on the application and what on the system.
         *    For now, just lump all the Swap in one place.
         *    For kernels reporting SwapPss {@link #getSummaryTotalSwapPss()}
         *    will report the application proportional Swap.
