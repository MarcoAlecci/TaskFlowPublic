     * Sets the intended frame rate for this surface.
     *
     * <p>On devices that are capable of running the display at different refresh rates,
     * the system may choose a display refresh rate to better match this surface's frame
     * rate. Usage of this API won't introduce frame rate throttling, or affect other
     * aspects of the application's frame production pipeline. However, because the system
     * may change the display refresh rate, calls to this function may result in changes
     * to Choreographer callback timings, and changes to the time interval at which the
     * system releases buffers back to the application.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that this only has an effect for surfaces presented on the display. If this
     * surface is consumed by something other than the system compositor, e.g. a media
     * codec, this call has no effect.</p>
     *
     * @param frameRate The intended frame rate of this surface, in frames per second. 0
     * is a special value that indicates the app will accept the system's choice for the
     * display frame rate, which is the default behavior if this function isn't
     * called. The frameRate param does <em>not</em> need to be a valid refresh rate for
     * this device's display - e.g., it's fine to pass 30fps to a device that can only run
     * the display at 60fps.
     *
     * @param compatibility The frame rate compatibility of this surface. The
     * compatibility value may influence the system's choice of display frame rate. See
     * the FRAME_RATE_COMPATIBILITY_* values for more info.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If frameRate or compatibility are invalid.
