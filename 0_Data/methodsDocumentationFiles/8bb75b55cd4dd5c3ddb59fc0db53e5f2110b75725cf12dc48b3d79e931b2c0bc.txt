     * Returns the current hash code of this buffer.
     *
     * <p> The hash code of a double buffer depends only upon its remaining
     * elements; that is, upon the elements from <tt>position()</tt> up to, and
     * including, the element at <tt>limit()</tt>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<tt>1</tt>.
     *
     * <p> Because buffer hash codes are content-dependent, it is inadvisable
     * to use buffers as keys in hash maps or similar data structures unless it
     * is known that their contents will not change.  </p>
     *
     * @return  The current hash code of this buffer
