     * Send a simulated key event for a media button to be received by the current client.
     * To simulate a key press, you must first send a KeyEvent built with
     * a {@link KeyEvent#ACTION_DOWN} action, then another event with the {@link KeyEvent#ACTION_UP}
     * action.
     * <p>The key event will be sent to the registered receiver
     * (see {@link AudioManager#registerMediaButtonEventReceiver(PendingIntent)}) whose associated
     * {@link RemoteControlClient}'s metadata and playback state is published (there may be
     * none under some circumstances).
     * @param keyEvent a {@link KeyEvent} instance whose key code is one of
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MUTE},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_PAUSE},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_PREVIOUS},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_REWIND},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_RECORD},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_FAST_FORWARD},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_CLOSE},
     *     {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_EJECT},
     *     or {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_AUDIO_TRACK}.
     * @return true if the event was successfully sent, false otherwise.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
