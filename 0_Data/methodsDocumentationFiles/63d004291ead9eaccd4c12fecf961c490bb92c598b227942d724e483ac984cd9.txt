     *
     * Note that the extension is dropped. For example, if you want to load
     * a sound from the raw resource file "explosion.mp3", you would specify
     * "R.raw.explosion" as the resource ID. Note that this means you cannot
     * have both an "explosion.wav" and an "explosion.mp3" in the res/raw
     * directory.
     *
     * @param context the application context
     * @param resId the resource ID
     * @param priority the priority of the sound. Currently has no effect. Use
     *                 a value of 1 for future compatibility.
     * @return a sound ID. This value can be used to play or unload the sound.
