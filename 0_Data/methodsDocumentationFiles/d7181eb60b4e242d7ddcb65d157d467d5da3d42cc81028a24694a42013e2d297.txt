         * <p>Returns the electro-optical transfer function (EOTF) of this color space.
         * The inverse function is the opto-electronic transfer function (OETF)
         * returned by {@link #getOetf()}. These functions are defined to satisfy the
         * following equality for \(x \in [0..1]\):</p>
         *
         * $$OETF(EOTF(x)) = EOTF(OETF(x)) = x$$
         *
         * <p>For RGB colors, this function can be used to convert from "gamma space"
         * (gamma encoded) to linear space. The terms gamma space and gamma encoded
         * are frequently used because many EOTFs can be closely approximated using
         * a simple power function of the form \(x^\gamma\) (the approximation of the
         * {@link Named#SRGB sRGB} EOTF uses \(\gamma=2.2\) for instance).</p>
