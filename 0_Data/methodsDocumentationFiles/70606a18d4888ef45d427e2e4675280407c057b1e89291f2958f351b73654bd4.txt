     * Returns whether this View has content which overlaps.
     *
     * <p>This function, intended to be overridden by specific View types, is an optimization when
     * alpha is set on a view. If rendering overlaps in a view with alpha < 1, that view is drawn to
     * an offscreen buffer and then composited into place, which can be expensive. If the view has
     * no overlapping rendering, the view can draw each primitive with the appropriate alpha value
     * directly. An example of overlapping rendering is a TextView with a background image, such as
     * a Button. An example of non-overlapping rendering is a TextView with no background, or an
     * ImageView with only the foreground image. The default implementation returns true; subclasses
     * should override if they have cases which can be optimized.</p>
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> The return value of this method is ignored if {@link
     * #forceHasOverlappingRendering(boolean)} has been called on this view.</p>
     *
     * @return true if the content in this view might overlap, false otherwise.
