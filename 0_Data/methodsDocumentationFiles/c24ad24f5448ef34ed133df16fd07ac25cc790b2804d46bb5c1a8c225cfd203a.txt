     * This function returns the calculated in-between value for a color
     * given integers that represent the start and end values in the four
     * bytes of the 32-bit int. Each channel is separately linearly interpolated
     * and the resulting calculated values are recombined into the return value.
     *
     * @param fraction The fraction from the starting to the ending values
     * @param startValue A 32-bit int value representing colors in the
     * separate bytes of the parameter
     * @param endValue A 32-bit int value representing colors in the
     * separate bytes of the parameter
     * @return A value that is calculated to be the linearly interpolated
     * result, derived by separating the start and end values into separate
     * color channels and interpolating each one separately, recombining the
     * resulting values in the same way.
