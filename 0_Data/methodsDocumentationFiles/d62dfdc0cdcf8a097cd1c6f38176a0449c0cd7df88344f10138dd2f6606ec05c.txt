     * For requests that use the Camera1 API preview output stream, this will block if there are
     * already {@code maxInFlight} requests in progress (until at least one prior request has
     * completed). For requests that use the Camera1 API jpeg callbacks, this will block until
     * all prior requests have been completed to avoid stopping preview for
     * {@link android.hardware.Camera#takePicture} before prior preview requests have been
     * completed.

     * @param holder the {@link RequestHolder} for this request.

     * @param unit the units to use for the timeout.
     * @return {@code false} if this method timed out.
     * @throws InterruptedException if this thread is interrupted.
