     * Check if the supplied subscription ID is usable.
     *
     * <p>A usable subscription ID is a valid subscription ID, but not necessarily an active
     * subscription ID (see {@link #isActiveSubscriptionId(int)}). Some subscription APIs
     * require a usable subscription ID, and this is noted in their documentation; otherwise, a
     * subscription ID does not need to be usable for subscription functions, only valid.
     *
     * @param subscriptionId the subscription ID
     * @return {@code true} if the subscription ID is usable; {@code false} otherwise.
