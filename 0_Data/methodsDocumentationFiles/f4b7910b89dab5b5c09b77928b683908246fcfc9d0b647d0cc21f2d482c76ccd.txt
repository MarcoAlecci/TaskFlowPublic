     *
     * If {@link #DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream, Deflater, int, boolean)
     * syncFlush} is {@code true} when this compressed output stream is
     * constructed, this method first flushes the underlying {@code compressor}
     * with the flush mode {@link Deflater#SYNC_FLUSH} to force
     * all pending data to be flushed out to the output stream and then
     * flushes the output stream. Otherwise this method only flushes the
     * output stream without flushing the {@code compressor}.

     * @throws IOException if an I/O error has occurred
