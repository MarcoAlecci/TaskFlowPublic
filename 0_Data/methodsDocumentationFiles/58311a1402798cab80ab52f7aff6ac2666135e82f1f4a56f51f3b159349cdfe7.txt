     * Called when the host view is attempting to determine if an item's position
     * has changed. Returns {@link #POSITION_UNCHANGED} if the position of the given
     * item has not changed or {@link #POSITION_NONE} if the item is no longer present
     * in the adapter.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation assumes that items will never
     * change position and always returns {@link #POSITION_UNCHANGED}.
     *
     * @param object Object representing an item, previously returned by a call to
     *               {@link #instantiateItem(android.view.View, int)}.
     * @return object's new position index from [0, {@link #getCount()}),
     *         {@link #POSITION_UNCHANGED} if the object's position has not changed,
     *         or {@link #POSITION_NONE} if the item is no longer present.
