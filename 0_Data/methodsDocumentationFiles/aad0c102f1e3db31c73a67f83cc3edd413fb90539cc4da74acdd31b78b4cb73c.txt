     * Specifies that a sync should be requested with the specified the account, authority,
     * and extras at the given frequency. If there is already another periodic sync scheduled
     * with the account, authority and extras then a new periodic sync won't be added, instead
     * the frequency of the previous one will be updated.
     * <p>
     * These periodic syncs honor the "syncAutomatically" and "masterSyncAutomatically" settings.
     * Although these sync are scheduled at the specified frequency, it may take longer for it to
     * actually be started if other syncs are ahead of it in the sync operation queue. This means
     * that the actual start time may drift.
     * <p>
     * Periodic syncs are not allowed to have any of {@link #SYNC_EXTRAS_DO_NOT_RETRY},
     * {@link #SYNC_EXTRAS_IGNORE_BACKOFF}, {@link #SYNC_EXTRAS_IGNORE_SETTINGS},
     * {@link #SYNC_EXTRAS_INITIALIZE}, {@link #SYNC_EXTRAS_FORCE},
     * {@link #SYNC_EXTRAS_EXPEDITED}, {@link #SYNC_EXTRAS_MANUAL} set to true.
     * If any are supplied then an {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown.

     * <p>The bundle for a periodic sync can be queried by applications with the correct
     * permissions using
     * {@link ContentResolver#getPeriodicSyncs(Account account, String provider)}, so no
     * sensitive data should be transferred here.

     * @param account the account to specify in the sync
     * @param authority the provider to specify in the sync request
     * @param extras extra parameters to go along with the sync request
     * @param pollFrequency how frequently the sync should be performed, in seconds.
     * On Android API level 24 and above, a minmam interval of 15 minutes is enforced.
     * On previous versions, the minimum interval is 1 hour.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if an illegal extra was set or if any of the parameters
     * are null.
