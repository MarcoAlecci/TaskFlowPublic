     * Return a drawable object associated with a particular resource ID for the
     * given screen density in DPI. This will set the drawable's density to be
     * the device's density multiplied by the ratio of actual drawable density
     * to requested density. This allows the drawable to be scaled up to the
     * correct size if needed. Various types of objects will be returned
     * depending on the underlying resource -- for example, a solid color, PNG
     * image, scalable image, etc. The Drawable API hides these implementation
     * details.
     *
     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To obtain a themed drawable, use
     * {@link android.content.Context#getDrawable(int) Context.getDrawable(int)}
     * or {@link #getDrawableForDensity(int, int, Theme)} passing the desired
     * theme.</p>
     *
     * @param id The desired resource identifier, as generated by the aapt tool.
     *            This integer encodes the package, type, and resource entry.
     *            The value 0 is an invalid identifier.
     * @param density the desired screen density indicated by the resource as
     *            found in {@link DisplayMetrics}. A value of 0 means to use the
     *            density returned from {@link #getConfiguration()}.
     *            This is equivalent to calling {@link #getDrawable(int)}.
     * @return Drawable An object that can be used to draw this resource.
     * @throws NotFoundException Throws NotFoundException if the given ID does
     *             not exist.
     * @see #getDrawableForDensity(int, int, Theme)
     * @deprecated Use {@link #getDrawableForDensity(int, int, Theme)} instead.
