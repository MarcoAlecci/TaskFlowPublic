     * <p>Normally, the autofill context is automatically started if necessary when
     * {@link #notifyViewEntered(View)} is called, but this method should be used in the
     * cases where it must be explicitly started. For example, when the view offers an AUTOFILL
     * option on its contextual overflow menu, and the user selects it.
