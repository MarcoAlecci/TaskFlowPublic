         * Returns the physical height of the display in pixels when configured in this mode's
         * resolution.
         * <p>
         * Note that due to application UI scaling, the number of pixels made available to
         * applications when the mode is active (as reported by {@link Display#getHeight()} may
         * differ from the mode's actual resolution (as reported by this function).
         * <p>
         * For example, applications running on a 4K display may have their UI laid out and rendered
         * in 1080p and then scaled up. Applications can take advantage of the extra resolution by
         * rendering content through a {@link android.view.SurfaceView} using full size buffers.
