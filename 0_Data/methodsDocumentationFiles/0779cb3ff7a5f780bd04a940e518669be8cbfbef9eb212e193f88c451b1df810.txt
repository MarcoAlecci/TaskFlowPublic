     * Start method tracing with default log name and buffer size.
     * <p>
     * By default, the trace file is called "dmtrace.trace" and it's placed
     * under your package-specific directory on primary shared/external storage,
     * as returned by {@link Context#getExternalFilesDir(String)}.
     * <p>
     * See <a href="{@docRoot}studio/profile/traceview.html">Inspect Trace Logs
     * with Traceview</a> for information about reading trace files.
     * <p class="note">
     * When method tracing is enabled, the VM will run more slowly than usual,
     * so the timings from the trace files should only be considered in relative
     * terms (e.g. was run #1 faster than run #2). The times for native methods
     * will not change, so don't try to use this to compare the performance of
     * interpreted and native implementations of the same method. As an
     * alternative, consider using sampling-based method tracing via
     * {@link #startMethodTracingSampling(String, int, int)} or "native" tracing
     * in the emulator via {@link #startNativeTracing()}.
     * </p>
