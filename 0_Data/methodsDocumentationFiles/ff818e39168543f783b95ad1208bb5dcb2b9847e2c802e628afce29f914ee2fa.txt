         * <p>Starting in {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#R, this conversation title will be ignored if a

         * case, {@link ShortcutInfo#getLongLabel()} (or, if missing,
         * {@link ShortcutInfo#getShortLabel()}) will be shown as the conversation title

         * <p>This API's behavior was changed in SDK version {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#P}. If your
         * application's target version is less than {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#P}, setting a
         * conversation title to a non-null value will make {@link #isGroupConversation()} return
         * {@code true} and passing {@code null} will make it return {@code false}. In
         * {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#P} and beyond, use {@link #setGroupConversation(boolean)}
         * to set group conversation status.
