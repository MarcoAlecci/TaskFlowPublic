     * Set one or more {@link Uri}s to send using Android Beam (TM). Every
     * Uri you provide must have either scheme 'file' or scheme 'content'.
     *
     * <p>For the data provided through this method, Android Beam tries to
     * switch to alternate transports such as Bluetooth to achieve a fast
     * transfer speed. Hence this method is very suitable
     * for transferring large files such as pictures or songs.
     *
     * <p>The receiving side will store the content of each Uri in
     * a file and present a notification to the user to open the file
     * with a {@link android.content.Intent} with action
     * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_VIEW}.
     * If multiple URIs are sent, the {@link android.content.Intent} will refer
     * to the first of the stored files.
     *
     * <p>This method may be called at any time before {@link Activity#onDestroy},
     * but the URI(s) are only made available for Android Beam when the
     * specified activity(s) are in resumed (foreground) state. The recommended
     * approach is to call this method during your Activity's
     * {@link Activity#onCreate} - see sample
     * code below. This method does not immediately perform any I/O or blocking work,
     * so is safe to call on your main thread.
     *
     * <p>{@link #setBeamPushUris} and {@link #setBeamPushUrisCallback}
     * have priority over both {@link #setNdefPushMessage} and
     * {@link #setNdefPushMessageCallback}.
     *
     * <p>If {@link #setBeamPushUris} is called with a null Uri array,
     * and/or {@link #setBeamPushUrisCallback} is called with a null callback,
     * then the Uri push will be completely disabled for the specified activity(s).
     *
     * <p>Code example:
     * <pre>
     * protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     *     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
     *     NfcAdapter nfcAdapter = NfcAdapter.getDefaultAdapter(this);
     *     if (nfcAdapter == null) return;  // NFC not available on this device
     *     nfcAdapter.setBeamPushUris(new Uri[] {uri1, uri2}, this);
     * }</pre>
     * And that is it. Only one call per activity is necessary. The Android
     * OS will automatically release its references to the Uri(s) and the
     * Activity object when it is destroyed if you follow this pattern.
     *
     * <p>If your Activity wants to dynamically supply Uri(s),
     * then set a callback using {@link #setBeamPushUrisCallback} instead
     * of using this method.
     *
     * <p class="note">Do not pass in an Activity that has already been through
     * {@link Activity#onDestroy}. This is guaranteed if you call this API
     * during {@link Activity#onCreate}.
     *
     * <p class="note">If this device does not support alternate transports
     * such as Bluetooth or WiFI, calling this method does nothing.
     *
     * <p class="note">Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#NFC} permission.
     *
     * @param uris an array of Uri(s) to push over Android Beam
     * @param activity activity for which the Uri(s) will be pushed
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if FEATURE_NFC is unavailable.
     * @deprecated this feature is deprecated. File sharing can work using other technology like
     * Bluetooth.
