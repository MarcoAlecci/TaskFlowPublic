     * Same as {@link #addResultsToIntent} but for setting data results. This is used
     * for inputs that accept non-textual results (see {@link Builder#setAllowDataType}).
     * Only one result can be provided for every mime type accepted by the RemoteInput.
     * If multiple inputs of the same mime type are expected then multiple RemoteInputs
     * should be used.
     *
     * @param remoteInput The remote input for which results are being provided
     * @param intent The intent to add remote input results to. The {@link ClipData}
     *               field of the intent will be modified to contain the results.
     * @param results A map of mime type to the Uri result for that mime type.
