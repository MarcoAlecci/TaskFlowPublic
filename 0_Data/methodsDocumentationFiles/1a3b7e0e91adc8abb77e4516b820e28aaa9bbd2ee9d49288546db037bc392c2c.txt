     * Checks a touch event.
     * @param event The event.
     * @param nestingLevel The nesting level: 0 if called from the base class,
     * or 1 from a subclass.  If the event was already checked by this consistency verifier
     * at a higher nesting level, it will not be checked again.  Used to handle the situation
     * where a subclass dispatching method delegates to its superclass's dispatching method
     * and both dispatching methods call into the consistency verifier.
