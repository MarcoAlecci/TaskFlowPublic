     * Starts TV program recording in the current recording session. Recording is expected to start
     * immediately when this method is called. If the current recording session has not yet tuned to
     * any channel, this method throws an exception.
     *
     * <p>The application may supply the URI for a TV program for filling in program specific data
     * fields in the {@link android.media.tv.TvContract.RecordedPrograms} table.
     * A non-null {@code programUri} implies the started recording should be of that specific
     * program, whereas null {@code programUri} does not impose such a requirement and the
     * recording can span across multiple TV programs. In either case, the application must call
     * {@link TvRecordingClient#stopRecording()} to stop the recording.
     *
     * <p>The recording session will respond by calling {@link RecordingCallback#onError(int)} if
     * the start request cannot be fulfilled.
     *
     * @param programUri The URI for the TV program to record, built by
     *            {@link TvContract#buildProgramUri(long)}. Can be {@code null}.
     * @param params Domain-specific data for this request. Keys <em>must</em> be a scoped
     *            name, i.e. prefixed with a package name you own, so that different developers will
     *            not create conflicting keys.
     * @throws IllegalStateException If {@link #tune} request hasn't been handled yet.
