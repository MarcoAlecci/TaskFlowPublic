     * Returns true if (x,y) is inside the rectangle. The left and top are
     * considered to be inside, while the right and bottom are not. This means
     * that for a x,y to be contained: left <= x < right and top <= y < bottom.
     * An empty rectangle never contains any point.
     *
     * @param x The X coordinate of the point being tested for containment
     * @param y The Y coordinate of the point being tested for containment
     * @return true iff (x,y) are contained by the rectangle, where containment
     *              means left <= x < right and top <= y < bottom
