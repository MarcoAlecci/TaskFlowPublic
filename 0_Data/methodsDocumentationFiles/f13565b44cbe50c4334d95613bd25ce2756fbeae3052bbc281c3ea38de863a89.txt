     * Compute an approximation for how much time (in milliseconds) remains until the battery is
     * fully charged. Returns -1 if no time can be computed: either there is not enough current
     * data to make a decision or the battery is currently discharging.
     *
     * @return how much time is left, in milliseconds, until the battery is fully charged or -1 if
     *         the computation fails
