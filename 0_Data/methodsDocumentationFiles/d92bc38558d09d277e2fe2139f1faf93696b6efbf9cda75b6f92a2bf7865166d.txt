     * This method is called by ViewGroup when a child view is about to be removed from the
     * container. This callback starts the process of a transition; we grab the starting
     * values, listen for changes to all of the children of the container, and start appropriate
     * animations.
     *
     * @param parent The ViewGroup from which the View is being removed.
     * @param child The View being removed from the ViewGroup.
