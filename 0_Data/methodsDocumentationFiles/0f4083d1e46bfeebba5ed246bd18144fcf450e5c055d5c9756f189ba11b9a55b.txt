         * Sets the location of the text insertion point (zero width cursor) as a rectangle in
         * local coordinates. Calling this can be skipped when there is no text insertion point;
         * however if there is an insertion point, editors must call this method.
         * @param horizontalPosition horizontal position of the insertion marker, in the local
         * coordinates that will be transformed with the transformation matrix when rendered on the
         * screen. This should be calculated or compatible with
         * {@link Layout#getPrimaryHorizontal(int)}.
         * @param lineTop vertical position of the insertion marker, in the local coordinates that
         * will be transformed with the transformation matrix when rendered on the screen. This
         * should be calculated or compatible with {@link Layout#getLineTop(int)}.
         * @param lineBaseline vertical position of the insertion marker, in the local coordinates
         * that will be transformed with the transformation matrix when rendered on the screen. This
         * should be calculated or compatible with {@link Layout#getLineBaseline(int)}.
         * @param lineBottom vertical position of the insertion marker, in the local coordinates
         * that will be transformed with the transformation matrix when rendered on the screen. This
         * should be calculated or compatible with {@link Layout#getLineBottom(int)}.
         * @param flags flags of the insertion marker. See {@link #FLAG_HAS_VISIBLE_REGION} for
         * example.
