     * Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
     * on an SSL connection.  Normally, only a subset of these will actually
     * be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
     * do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults.  Such
     * cipher suites are useful in specialized applications.
     *
     * <p class="caution">Applications should not blindly enable all supported
     * cipher suites.  The supported cipher suites can include signaling cipher suite
     * values that can cause connection problems if enabled inappropriately.
     *
     * <p>The proper way to use this method is to either check if a specific cipher
     * suite is supported via {@code Arrays.asList(getSupportedCipherSuites()).contains(...)}
     * or to filter a desired list of cipher suites to only the supported ones via
     * {@code desiredSuiteSet.retainAll(Arrays.asList(getSupportedCipherSuites()))}.
