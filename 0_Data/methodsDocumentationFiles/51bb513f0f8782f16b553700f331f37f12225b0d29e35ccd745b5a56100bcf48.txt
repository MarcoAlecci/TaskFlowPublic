     * Returns a list of physical USB ports on the device.
     * <p>
     * This list is guaranteed to contain all dual-role USB Type C ports but it might
     * be missing other ports depending on whether the kernel USB drivers have been
     * updated to publish all of the device's ports through the new "dual_role_usb"
     * device class (which supports all types of ports despite its name).
