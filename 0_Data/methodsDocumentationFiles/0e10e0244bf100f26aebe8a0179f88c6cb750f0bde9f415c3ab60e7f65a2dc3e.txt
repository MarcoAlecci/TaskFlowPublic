     * The layer type of a TextureView is ignored since a TextureView is always
     * considered to act as a hardware layer. The optional paint supplied to this
     * method will however be taken into account when rendering the content of
     * this TextureView.

     * @param layerType The type of layer to use with this view, must be one of

     * @param paint The paint used to compose the layer. This argument is optional
     *        and can be null. It is ignored when the layer type is
