     * Controls whether the bottom strips on the tab indicators are drawn or
     * not.  The default is to draw them.  If the user specifies a custom
     * view for the tab indicators, then the TabHost class calls this method
     * to disable drawing of the bottom strips.
     * @param stripEnabled true if the bottom strips should be drawn.
