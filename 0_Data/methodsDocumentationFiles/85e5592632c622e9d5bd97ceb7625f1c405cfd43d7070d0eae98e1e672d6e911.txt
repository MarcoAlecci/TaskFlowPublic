     * the update.
     *
     * <p>This callback is only applicable to device owners and profile owners.
     *
     * <p>To get further information about a pending system update (for example, whether or not the
     * update is a security patch), the device owner or profile owner can call
     * {@link DevicePolicyManager#getPendingSystemUpdate}.
