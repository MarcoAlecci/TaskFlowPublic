     * Make the device lock immediately, as if the lock screen timeout has expired at the point of
     * this call.
     * <p>
     * This method secures the device in response to an urgent situation, such as a lost or stolen
     * device. After this method is called, the device must be unlocked using strong authentication
     * (PIN, pattern, or password). This API is intended for use only by device admins.
     * <p>
     * From version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R} onwards, the caller must either have
     * the LOCK_DEVICE permission or the device must have the device admin feature; if neither is
     * true, then the method will return without completing any action. Before version
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R}, the device needed the device admin feature,
     * regardless of the caller's permissions.
     * <p>
     * The calling device admin must have requested {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_FORCE_LOCK}
     * to be able to call this method; if it has not, a security exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * If there's no lock type set, this method forces the device to go to sleep but doesn't lock
     * the device. Device admins who find the device in this state can lock an otherwise-insecure
     * device by first calling {@link #resetPassword} to set the password and then lock the device.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to lock the parent profile as
     * well as the managed profile.
     * <p>
     * NOTE: In order to lock the parent profile and evict the encryption key of the managed
     * profile, {@link #lockNow()} must be called twice: First, {@link #lockNow()} should be called
     * on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)}, then {@link #lockNow(int)} should be
     * called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance associated with the managed profile,
     * with the {@link #FLAG_EVICT_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY} flag.
     * Calling the method twice in this order ensures that all users are locked and does not
     * stop the device admin on the managed profile from issuing a second call to lock its own
     * profile.
     *
     * @param flags May be 0 or {@link #FLAG_EVICT_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY}.
     * @throws SecurityException if the calling application does not own an active administrator
     *             that uses {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_FORCE_LOCK} or the
     *             {@link #FLAG_EVICT_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY} flag is passed by an application
     *             that is not a profile
     *             owner of a managed profile.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the {@link #FLAG_EVICT_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY} flag is
     *             passed when locking the parent profile.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the {@link #FLAG_EVICT_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
     *             flag is passed when {@link #getStorageEncryptionStatus} does not return
     *             {@link #ENCRYPTION_STATUS_ACTIVE_PER_USER}.
