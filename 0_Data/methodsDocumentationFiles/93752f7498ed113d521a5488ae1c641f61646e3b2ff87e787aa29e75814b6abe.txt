     * Returns the current standby bucket of the calling app. The system determines the standby
     * state of the app based on app usage patterns. Standby buckets determine how much an app will
     * be restricted from running background tasks such as jobs and alarms.
     * <p>Restrictions increase progressively from {@link #STANDBY_BUCKET_ACTIVE} to
     * {@link #STANDBY_BUCKET_RESTRICTED}, with {@link #STANDBY_BUCKET_ACTIVE} being the least
     * restrictive. The battery level of the device might also affect the restrictions.
     * <p>Apps in buckets &le; {@link #STANDBY_BUCKET_ACTIVE} have no standby restrictions imposed.
     * Apps in buckets &gt; {@link #STANDBY_BUCKET_FREQUENT} may have network access restricted when
     * running in the background.
     * <p>The standby state of an app can change at any time either due to a user interaction or a
     * system interaction or some algorithm determining that the app can be restricted for a period
     * of time before the user has a need for it.
     * <p>You can also query the recent history of standby bucket changes by calling
     * {@link #queryEventsForSelf(long, long)} and searching for
     * {@link UsageEvents.Event#STANDBY_BUCKET_CHANGED}.
     *
     * @return the current standby bucket of the calling app. One of STANDBY_BUCKET_* constants.
