     * Allows a foreground application to specify which card emulation service
     * should be enabled while a specific Activity is in the foreground.
     *
     * <p>The specified HCE-F service is only enabled when the corresponding application is
     * in the foreground and this method has been called. When the application is moved to
     * the background, {@link #disableService(Activity)} is called, or
     * NFCID2 or System Code is replaced, the HCE-F service is disabled.
     *
     * <p>The specified Activity must currently be in resumed state. A good
     * paradigm is to call this method in your {@link Activity#onResume}, and to call
     * {@link #disableService(Activity)} in your {@link Activity#onPause}.
     *
     * <p>Note that this preference is not persisted by the OS, and hence must be
     * called every time the Activity is resumed.
     *
     * @param activity The activity which prefers this service to be invoked
     * @param service The service to be preferred while this activity is in the foreground
     * @return whether the registration was successful
