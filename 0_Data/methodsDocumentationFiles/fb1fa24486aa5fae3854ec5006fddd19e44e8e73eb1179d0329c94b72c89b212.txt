     * the captive portal is still in place.  The system will treat the network
     * as if it did not have a captive portal when selecting the network to use
     * as the default active data network. This may result in this network
     * becoming the default active data network, which could disrupt network
     * connectivity for apps because the captive portal is still in place.
