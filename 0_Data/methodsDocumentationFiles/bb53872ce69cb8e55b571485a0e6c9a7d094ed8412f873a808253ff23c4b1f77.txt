     * This flag controls whether CHANGE_APPEARING or CHANGE_DISAPPEARING animations will
     * cause the default changing animation to be run on the parent hierarchy as well. This allows
     * containers of transitioning views to also transition, which may be necessary in situations
     * where the containers bounds change between the before/after states and may clip their
     * children during the transition animations. For example, layouts with wrap_content will
     * adjust their bounds according to the dimensions of their children.
     *
     * <p>The default changing transitions animate the bounds and scroll positions of the
     * target views. These are the animations that will run on the parent hierarchy, not
     * the custom animations that happen to be set on the transition. This allows custom
     * behavior for the children of the transitioning container, but uses standard behavior
     * of resizing/rescrolling on any changing parents.
     *
     * @param animateParentHierarchy A boolean value indicating whether the parents of
     * transitioning views should also be animated during the transition. Default value is true.
