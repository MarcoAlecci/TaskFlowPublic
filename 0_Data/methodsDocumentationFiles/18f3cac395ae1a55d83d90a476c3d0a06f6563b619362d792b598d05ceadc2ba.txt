     * Retrieve the set of output buffers.  Call this after start()
     * returns and whenever dequeueOutputBuffer signals an output
     * buffer change by returning {@link
     * #INFO_OUTPUT_BUFFERS_CHANGED}. After calling this method, any
     * ByteBuffers previously returned by an earlier call to this
     * method MUST no longer be used.
     *
     * @deprecated Use the new {@link #getOutputBuffer} method instead
     * each time an output buffer is dequeued.  This method is not
     * supported if codec is configured in asynchronous mode.
     *
     * <b>Note:</b> As of API 21, the position and limit of output
     * buffers that are dequeued will be set to the valid data
     * range.
     *
     * <em>Do not use this method if using an output surface.</em>
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if not in the Executing state,
     *         or codec is configured in asynchronous mode.
     * @throws MediaCodec.CodecException upon codec error.
