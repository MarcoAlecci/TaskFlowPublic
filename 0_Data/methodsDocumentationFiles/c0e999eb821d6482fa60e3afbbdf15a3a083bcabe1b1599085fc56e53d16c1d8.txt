     * Dispatch one step of a nested scroll in progress before this view consumes any portion of it.
     *
     * <p>Nested pre-scroll events are to nested scroll events what touch intercept is to touch.
     * <code>dispatchNestedPreScroll</code> offers an opportunity for the parent view in a nested
     * scrolling operation to consume some or all of the scroll operation before the child view
     * consumes it.</p>

     * @param dx Horizontal scroll distance in pixels
     * @param dy Vertical scroll distance in pixels
     * @param consumed Output. If not null, consumed[0] will contain the consumed component of dx
     *                 and consumed[1] the consumed dy.
     * @param offsetInWindow Optional. If not null, on return this will contain the offset
     *                       in local view coordinates of this view from before this operation
     *                       to after it completes. View implementations may use this to adjust
     *                       expected input coordinate tracking.
     * @return true if the parent consumed some or all of the scroll delta
     * @see #dispatchNestedScroll(int, int, int, int, int[])
