         * Allows traffic from the specified address family.
         *
         * By default, if no address, route or DNS server of a specific family (IPv4 or IPv6) is
         * added to this VPN, then all outgoing traffic of that family is blocked. If any address,
         * route or DNS server is added, that family is allowed.
         *
         * This method allows an address family to be unblocked even without adding an address,
         * route or DNS server of that family. Traffic of that family will then typically
         * fall-through to the underlying network if it's supported.
         *
         * {@code family} must be either {@code AF_INET} (for IPv4) or {@code AF_INET6} (for IPv6).
         * {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown if it's neither.
         *
         * @param family The address family ({@code AF_INET} or {@code AF_INET6}) to allow.
         *
         * @return this {@link Builder} object to facilitate chaining of method calls.
