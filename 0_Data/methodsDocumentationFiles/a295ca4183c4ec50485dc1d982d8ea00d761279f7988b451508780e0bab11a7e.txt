     * <p>A TV input may have a parent input if the TV input is actually a logical representation of
     * a device behind the hardware port represented by the parent input.
     * For example, a HDMI CEC logical device, connected to a HDMI port, appears as another TV
     * input. In this case, the parent input of this logical device is the HDMI port.
     *
     * <p>Applications may group inputs by parent input ID to provide an easier access to inputs
     * sharing the same physical port. In the example of HDMI CEC, logical HDMI CEC devices behind
     * the same HDMI port have the same parent ID, which is the ID representing the port. Thus
     * applications can group the hardware HDMI port and the logical HDMI CEC devices behind it
     * together using this method.
     *
     * @return the ID of the parent input, if exists. Returns {@code null} if the parent input is
     *         not specified.
