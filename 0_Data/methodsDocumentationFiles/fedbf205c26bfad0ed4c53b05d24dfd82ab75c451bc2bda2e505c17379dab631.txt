     * The most recent value calculated by this <code>ValueAnimator</code> when there is just one
     * property being animated. This value is only sensible while the animation is running. The main
     * purpose for this read-only property is to retrieve the value from the <code>ValueAnimator</code>
     * during a call to {@link AnimatorUpdateListener#onAnimationUpdate(ValueAnimator)}, which
     * is called during each animation frame, immediately after the value is calculated.
     *
     * @return animatedValue The value most recently calculated by this <code>ValueAnimator</code> for
     * the single property being animated. If there are several properties being animated
     * (specified by several PropertyValuesHolder objects in the constructor), this function
     * returns the animated value for the first of those objects.
