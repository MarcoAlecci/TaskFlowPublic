     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZonedDateTime} from a local date-time
     * using the preferred offset if possible.
     * <p>
     * The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
     * This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
     * date-time as defined by the {@link ZoneRules rules} of the zone ID.
     *<p>
     * In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
     * In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
     * If the preferred offset is one of the valid offsets then it is used.
     * Otherwise the earlier valid offset is used, typically corresponding to "summer".
     * <p>
     * In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
     * Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
     * For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
     * moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".
     *
     * @param localDateTime  the local date-time, not null
     * @param zone  the time-zone, not null
     * @param preferredOffset  the zone offset, null if no preference
     * @return the zoned date-time, not null
