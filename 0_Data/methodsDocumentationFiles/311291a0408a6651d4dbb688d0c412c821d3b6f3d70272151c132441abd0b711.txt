     * Runs a query with the specified constraint. This query is requested
     * by the filter attached to this adapter.
     *
     * The query is provided by a
     * {@link android.widget.FilterQueryProvider}.
     * If no provider is specified, the current cursor is not filtered and returned.
     *
     * After this method returns the resulting cursor is passed to {@link #changeCursor(Cursor)}
     * and the previous cursor is closed.
     *
     * This method is always executed on a background thread, not on the
     * application's main thread (or UI thread.)
     * 
     * Contract: when constraint is null or empty, the original results,
     * prior to any filtering, must be returned.
     *
     * @param constraint the constraint with which the query must be filtered
     *
     * @return a Cursor representing the results of the new query
