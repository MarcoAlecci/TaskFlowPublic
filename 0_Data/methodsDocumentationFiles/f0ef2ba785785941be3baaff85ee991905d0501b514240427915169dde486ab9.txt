     * Same as calling {@link #startNextMatchingActivity(Intent, Bundle)} with
     * no options.
     *
     * @param intent The intent to dispatch to the next activity.  For
     * correct behavior, this must be the same as the Intent that started
     * your own activity; the only changes you can make are to the extras
     * inside of it.
     *
     * @return Returns a boolean indicating whether there was another Activity
     * to start: true if there was a next activity to start, false if there
     * wasn't.  In general, if true is returned you will then want to call
     * finish() on yourself.
