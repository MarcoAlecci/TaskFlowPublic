     * This function checks if there is a plus sign (+) in the passed-in dialing number.
     * If there is, it processes the plus sign based on the default telephone
     * numbering plan of the system when the phone is activated and the current
     * telephone numbering plan of the system that the phone is camped on.
     * Currently, we only support the case that the default and current telephone
     * numbering plans are North American Numbering Plan(NANP).
     *
     * The passed-in dialStr should only contain the valid format as described below,
     * 1) the 1st character in the dialStr should be one of the really dialable
     *    characters listed below
     *    ISO-LATIN characters 0-9, *, # , +
     * 2) the dialStr should already strip out the separator characters,
     *    every character in the dialStr should be one of the non separator characters
     *    listed below
     *    ISO-LATIN characters 0-9, *, # , +, WILD, WAIT, PAUSE
     *
     * Otherwise, this function returns the dial string passed in
     *
     * @param dialStr the original dial string
     * @return the converted dial string if the current/default countries belong to NANP,
     * and if there is the "+" in the original dial string. Otherwise, the original dial
     * string returns.
