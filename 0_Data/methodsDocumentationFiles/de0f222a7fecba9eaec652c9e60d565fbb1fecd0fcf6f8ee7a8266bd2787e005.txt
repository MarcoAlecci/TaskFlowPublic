         * Returns the position of the ViewHolder in terms of the latest layout pass.
         * <p>
         * This position is mostly used by RecyclerView components to be consistent while
         * RecyclerView lazily processes adapter updates.
         * <p>
         * For performance and animation reasons, RecyclerView batches all adapter updates until the
         * next layout pass. This may cause mismatches between the Adapter position of the item and
         * the position it had in the latest layout calculations.
         * <p>
         * LayoutManagers should always call this method while doing calculations based on item
         * positions. All methods in {@link RecyclerView.LayoutManager}, {@link RecyclerView.State},
         * {@link RecyclerView.Recycler} that receive a position expect it to be the layout position
         * of the item.
         * <p>
         * If LayoutManager needs to call an external method that requires the adapter position of
         * the item, it can use {@link #getAdapterPosition()} or
         * {@link RecyclerView.Recycler#convertPreLayoutPositionToPostLayout(int)}.
         *
         * @return Returns the adapter position of the ViewHolder in the latest layout pass.
