     * Get a list of supported high speed video recording FPS ranges.
     * <p>
     * When {@link CameraMetadata#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_CONSTRAINED_HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO} is
     * supported in {@link CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES}, this method will
     * list the supported high speed video FPS range configurations. Application can then use
     * {@link #getHighSpeedVideoSizesFor} to query available sizes for one of returned FPS range.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To enable high speed video recording, application must create a constrained create high speed
     * capture session via {@link CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession}, and submit
     * a CaptureRequest list created by
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession#createHighSpeedRequestList}
     * to this session. The application must select the video size from this method and
     * {@link CaptureRequest#CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE FPS range} from
     * {@link #getHighSpeedVideoFpsRangesFor} to configure the constrained high speed session and
     * generate the high speed request list. For example, if the application intends to do high
     * speed recording, it can select one FPS range reported by this method, query the video sizes
     * corresponding to this FPS range by {@link #getHighSpeedVideoSizesFor} and use one of reported
     * sizes to create a high speed capture session. Note that for the use case of multiple output
     * streams, application must select one unique size from this method to use (e.g., preview and
     * recording streams must have the same size). Otherwise, the high speed session creation will
     * fail. Once the high speed capture session is created, the application can set the FPS range
     * in the recording request lists via
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession#createHighSpeedRequestList}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The FPS ranges reported by this method will have below characteristics:
     * <li>The fpsMin and fpsMax will be a multiple 30fps.</li>
     * <li>The fpsMin will be no less than 30fps, the fpsMax will be no less than 120fps.</li>
     * <li>At least one range will be a fixed FPS range where fpsMin == fpsMax.</li>
     * <li>For each fixed FPS range, there will be one corresponding variable FPS range [30,
     * fps_max]. These kinds of FPS ranges are suitable for preview-only use cases where the
     * application doesn't want the camera device always produce higher frame rate than the display
     * refresh rate.</li>
     * </p>

     * @return an array of supported high speed video recording FPS ranges The upper bound of
     *         returned ranges is guaranteed to be larger or equal to 120.
