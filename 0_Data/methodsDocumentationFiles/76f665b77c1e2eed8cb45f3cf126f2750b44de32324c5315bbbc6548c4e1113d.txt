     * Force switch to a new input method component. This can only be called
     * from an application or a service which has a token of the currently active input method.
     *
     * <p>On Android {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#Q} and later devices, the undocumented behavior that
     * token can be {@code null} when the caller has
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS} is deprecated. Instead, update
     * {@link android.provider.Settings.Secure#DEFAULT_INPUT_METHOD} and
     * {@link android.provider.Settings.Secure#SELECTED_INPUT_METHOD_SUBTYPE} directly.</p>
     *
     * @param token Supplies the identifying token given to an input method
     * when it was started, which allows it to perform this operation on
     * itself.
     * @param id The unique identifier for the new input method to be switched to.
     * @deprecated Use {@link InputMethodService#switchInputMethod(String)}
     * instead. This method was intended for IME developers who should be accessing APIs through
     * the service. APIs in this class are intended for app developers interacting with the IME.
