         * Should return a composite flag which defines the enabled move directions in each state
         * (idle, swiping, dragging).
         * <p>
         * Instead of composing this flag manually, you can use {@link #makeMovementFlags(int,
         * int)}
         * or {@link #makeFlag(int, int)}.
         * <p>
         * This flag is composed of 3 sets of 8 bits, where first 8 bits are for IDLE state, next
         * 8 bits are for SWIPE state and third 8 bits are for DRAG state.
         * Each 8 bit sections can be constructed by simply OR'ing direction flags defined in
         * {@link ItemTouchHelper}.
         * <p>
         * For example, if you want it to allow swiping LEFT and RIGHT but only allow starting to
         * swipe by swiping RIGHT, you can return:
         * <pre>
         *      makeFlag(ACTION_STATE_IDLE, RIGHT) | makeFlag(ACTION_STATE_SWIPE, LEFT | RIGHT);
         * </pre>
         * This means, allow right movement while IDLE and allow right and left movement while
         * swiping.
         *
