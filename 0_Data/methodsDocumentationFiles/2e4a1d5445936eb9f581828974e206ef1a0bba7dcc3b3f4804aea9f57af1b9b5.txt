     * Inform the framework of a query for this device's UCE capabilities.
     * <p>
     * The framework will respond via the
     * {@link #respondToCapabilityRequest(String, RcsContactUceCapability, int)} or
     * {@link #respondToCapabilityRequestWithError(Uri, int, String, int)} method.
     * @param contactUri The URI associated with the remote contact that is requesting capabilities.
     * @param remoteInfo The remote contact's capability information.
     * @param operationToken An unique operation token that you have generated that will be returned
     *         by the framework in
     *         {@link #respondToCapabilityRequest(String, RcsContactUceCapability, int)}.
     * @throws ImsException If this {@link RcsSipOptionsImplBase} instance is not currently
     * connected to the framework. This can happen if the {@link RcsFeature} is not
     * {@link ImsFeature#STATE_READY} and the {@link RcsFeature} has not received the
     * {@link ImsFeature#onFeatureReady()} callback. This may also happen in rare cases when the
     * Telephony stack has crashed.
