     * Stop service discovery initiated with {@link #discoverServices}.  An active service
     * discovery is notified to the application with {@link DiscoveryListener#onDiscoveryStarted}
     * and it stays active until the application invokes a stop service discovery. A successful
     * stop is notified to with a call to {@link DiscoveryListener#onDiscoveryStopped}.
     *
     * <p> Upon failure to stop service discovery, application is notified through
     * {@link DiscoveryListener#onStopDiscoveryFailed}.
     *
     * @param listener This should be the listener object that was passed to {@link #discoverServices}.
     * It identifies the discovery that should be stopped and notifies of a successful or
     * unsuccessful stop.  In API versions 20 and above, the listener object may be used for
     * another service discovery once the callback has been called.  In API versions <= 19,
     * there is no entirely reliable way to know when a listener may be re-used, and a new
     * listener should be created for each service discovery request.
