         * <p>As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N} this information is displayed in the

         * On Android versions before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N}
         * this will be shown in the third line of text in the platform notification template.
         * You should not be using {@link #setProgress(int, int, boolean)} at the
         * same time on those versions; they occupy the same place.
