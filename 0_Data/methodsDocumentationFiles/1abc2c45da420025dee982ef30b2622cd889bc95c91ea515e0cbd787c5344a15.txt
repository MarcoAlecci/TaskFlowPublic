     * <p>Sets the bounds used as the epicenter of the enter and exit transitions.</p>
     *
     * <p>Transitions use Rect, referred to as the epicenter, to orient
     * the direction of travel. For popup windows, the anchor view bounds are
     * used as the default epicenter.</p>
     *
     * <p>See {@link Transition#setEpicenterCallback(EpicenterCallback)} for more
     * information about how transition epicenters work.</p>

     * @param bounds the epicenter bounds relative to the anchor view, or
     *               {@code null} to use the default epicenter
