     * taken, the permission grant will be remembered across device reboots.
     * Only URI permissions granted with
     * {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION} can be persisted. If
     * the grant has already been persisted, taking it again will touch
     * {@link UriPermission#getPersistedTime()}.
