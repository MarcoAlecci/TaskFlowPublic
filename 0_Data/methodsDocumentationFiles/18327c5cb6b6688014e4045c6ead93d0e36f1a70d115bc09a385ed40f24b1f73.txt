     * Setting this to a value greater than zero enables a built-in policy that will perform a
     * device or profile wipe after too many incorrect device-unlock passwords have been entered.
     * This built-in policy combines watching for failed passwords and wiping the device, and
     * requires that you request both {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_WATCH_LOGIN} and
     * {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_WIPE_DATA}}.
     * <p>
     * When this policy is set by a device owner, profile owner of an organization-owned device or
     * an admin on the primary user, the device will be factory reset after too many incorrect
     * password attempts. When set by a profile owner or an admin on a secondary user or a managed
     * profile, only the corresponding user or profile will be wiped.
     * <p>
     * To implement any other policy (e.g. wiping data for a particular application only, erasing or
     * revoking credentials, or reporting the failure to a server), you should implement
     * {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#onPasswordFailed(Context, android.content.Intent)} instead. Do not
     * use this API, because if the maximum count is reached, the device or profile will be wiped
     * immediately, and your callback will not be invoked.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called on the {@link DevicePolicyManager} instance returned by
     * {@link #getParentProfileInstance(ComponentName)} in order to set a value on the parent
     * profile.
     * <p>On devices not supporting {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_SECURE_LOCK_SCREEN} feature, the
     * password is always empty and this method has no effect - i.e. the policy is not set.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param num The number of failed password attempts at which point the device or profile will
     *            be wiped.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not an active administrator or does not use
     *             both {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_WATCH_LOGIN} and
     *             {@link DeviceAdminInfo#USES_POLICY_WIPE_DATA}.
