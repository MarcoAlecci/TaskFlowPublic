     * Explicitly limits content capture to the given packages and activities.
     *
     * <p>To reset the whitelist, call it passing {@code null} to both arguments.
     *
     * <p>Useful when the service wants to restrict content capture to a category of apps, like
     * chat apps. For example, if the service wants to support view captures on all activities of
     * app {@code ChatApp1} and just activities {@code act1} and {@code act2} of {@code ChatApp2},
     * it would call: {@code setContentCaptureWhitelist(Sets.newArraySet("ChatApp1"),
     * Sets.newArraySet(new ComponentName("ChatApp2", "act1"),
     * new ComponentName("ChatApp2", "act2")));}
