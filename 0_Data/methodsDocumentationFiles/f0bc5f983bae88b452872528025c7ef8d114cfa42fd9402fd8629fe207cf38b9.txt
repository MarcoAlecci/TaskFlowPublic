     * Allocate buffers ahead of time to avoid allocation delays during rendering.
     *
     * <p>Typically a Surface will allocate buffers lazily. This is usually fine and reduces the
     * memory usage of Surfaces that render rarely or never hit triple buffering. However
     * for UI it can result in a slight bit of jank on first launch. This hint will
     * tell the HardwareRenderer that now is a good time to allocate the 3 buffers
     * necessary for typical rendering.
     *
     * <p>Must be called after a {@link Surface} has been set.
     *
     * TODO: Figure out if we even need/want this. Should HWUI just be doing this in response
     * to setSurface anyway? Vulkan swapchain makes this murky, so delay making it public
