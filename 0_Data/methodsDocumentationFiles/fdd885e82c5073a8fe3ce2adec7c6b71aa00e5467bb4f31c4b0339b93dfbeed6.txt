     * user. By default, the user can use any input method.
     * <p>
     * When zero or more packages have been added, input method that are not in the list and not
     * part of the system can not be enabled by the user. This method will fail if it is called for
     * a admin that is not for the foreground user or a profile of the foreground user. Any
     * non-system input method service that's currently enabled must be included in the list.
     * <p>
     * Calling with a null value for the list disables the restriction so that all input methods can
     * be used, calling with an empty list disables all but the system's own input methods.
     * <p>
     * System input methods are always available to the user - this method can't modify this.

     * @return {@code true} if the operation succeeded, or {@code false} if the list didn't
