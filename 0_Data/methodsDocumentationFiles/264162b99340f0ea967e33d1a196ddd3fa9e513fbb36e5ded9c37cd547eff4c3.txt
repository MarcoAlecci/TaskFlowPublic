     * Returns an {@code Intent} that can be used for credential
     * installation. The intent may be used without any extras, in
     * which case the user will be able to install credentials from
     * their own source.
     *
     * <p>Alternatively, {@link #EXTRA_CERTIFICATE} or {@link
     * #EXTRA_PKCS12} maybe used to specify the bytes of an X.509
     * certificate or a PKCS#12 key store for installation. These
     * extras may be combined with {@link #EXTRA_NAME} to provide a
     * default alias name for credentials being installed.
     *
     * <p>When used with {@link Activity#startActivityForResult},
     * {@link Activity#RESULT_OK} will be returned if a credential was
     * successfully installed, otherwise {@link
     * Activity#RESULT_CANCELED} will be returned.
     *
     * <p>Starting from {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R}, the intent returned by this
     * method cannot be used for installing CA certificates. Since CA certificates can only be
     * installed via Settings, the app should provide the user with a file containing the
     * CA certificate. One way to do this would be to use the {@link android.provider.MediaStore}
     * API to write the certificate to the {@link android.provider.MediaStore.Downloads}
     * collection.
