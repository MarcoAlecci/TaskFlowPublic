     * Adds the id of a target view that this Transition is interested in
     * animating. By default, there are no targetIds, and a Transition will
     * listen for changes on every view in the hierarchy below the sceneRoot
     * of the Scene being transitioned into. Setting targetIds constrains
     * the Transition to only listen for, and act on, views with these IDs.
     * Views with different IDs, or no IDs whatsoever, will be ignored.
     *
     * <p>Note that using ids to specify targets implies that ids should be unique
     * within the view hierarchy underneath the scene root.</p>
     *
     * @see View#getId()
     * @param targetId The id of a target view, must be a positive number.
     * @return The Transition to which the targetId is added.
     * Returning the same object makes it easier to chain calls during
     * construction, such as
     * <code>transitionSet.addTransitions(new Fade()).addTarget(someId);</code>
