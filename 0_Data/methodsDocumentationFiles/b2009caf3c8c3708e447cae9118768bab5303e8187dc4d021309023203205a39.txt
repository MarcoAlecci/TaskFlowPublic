     * This function will normally be called for you automatically by
     * {@link android.app.LoaderManager} when restarting a Loader.  When using
     * a Loader with {@link android.app.LoaderManager},
     * you <em>must not</em> call this method yourself, or you will conflict
     * with its management of the Loader.
     *
     * Tell the Loader that it is being abandoned.  This is called prior
     * to {@link #reset} to have it retain its current data but not report
     * any new data.
