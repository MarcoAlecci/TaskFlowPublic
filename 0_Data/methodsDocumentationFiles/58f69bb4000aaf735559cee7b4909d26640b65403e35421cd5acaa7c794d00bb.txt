     * Called periodically when the device or profile challenge password is about to expire
     * or has expired.  It will typically be called at these times: on device boot, once per day
     * before the password expires, and at the time when the password expires.
     *
     * <p>If the password is not updated by the user, this method will continue to be called
     * once per day until the password is changed or the device admin disables password expiration.
     *
     * <p>The admin will typically post a notification requesting the user to change their password
     * in response to this call. The actual password expiration time can be obtained by calling
     * {@link DevicePolicyManager#getPasswordExpiration(ComponentName) }
     *
     * <p>The admin should be sure to take down any notifications it posted in response to this call
     * when it receives {@link DeviceAdminReceiver#onPasswordChanged(Context, Intent, UserHandle) }.
     *
     * @param context The running context as per {@link #onReceive}.
     * @param intent The received intent as per {@link #onReceive}.
     * @param user The user or profile for whom the password is expiring. To see whether this
     *        user is the current profile or a parent user, check for equality with
     *        {@link Process#myUserHandle}.
