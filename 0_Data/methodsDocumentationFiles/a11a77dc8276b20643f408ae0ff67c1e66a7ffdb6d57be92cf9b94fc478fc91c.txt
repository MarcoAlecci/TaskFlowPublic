     * This method is called by ViewGroup when a child view is about to be made visible in the
     * container. This callback starts the process of a transition; we grab the starting
     * values, listen for changes to all of the children of the container, and start appropriate
     * animations.
     *
     * @param parent The ViewGroup in which the View is being made visible.
     * @param child The View being made visible.
     * @param oldVisibility The previous visibility value of the child View, either
     * {@link View#GONE} or {@link View#INVISIBLE}.
