     * Changes the visibility of this View without triggering any other changes. This should only
     * be used by animation frameworks, such as {@link android.transition.Transition}, where
     * visibility changes should not adjust focus or trigger a new layout. Application developers
     * should use {@link #setVisibility} instead to ensure that the hierarchy is correctly updated.
     *
     * <p>Only call this method when a temporary visibility must be applied during an
     * animation and the original visibility value is guaranteed to be reset after the
     * animation completes. Use {@link #setVisibility} in all other cases.</p>
     *
     * @param visibility One of {@link #VISIBLE}, {@link #INVISIBLE}, or {@link #GONE}.
