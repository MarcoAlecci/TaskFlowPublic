         * onControlChanged() is called when the client loses or gains control of the radio tuner.
         * The control is always granted after a successful call to
         * {@link RadioManager#openTuner(int, RadioManager.BandConfig, boolean, Callback, Handler)}.
         * If another client opens the same tuner, onControlChanged() will be called with
         * control set to {@code false} to indicate loss of control.
         * At this point, RadioTuner APIs other than getters will return
         * {@link RadioManager#STATUS_INVALID_OPERATION}.
         * When the other client releases the tuner, onControlChanged() will be called
         * with control set to {@code true}.
