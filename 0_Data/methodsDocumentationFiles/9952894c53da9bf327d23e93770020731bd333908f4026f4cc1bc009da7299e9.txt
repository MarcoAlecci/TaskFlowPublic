     * Get the timestamp for the most recent buffer held by this Allocation.
     * The timestamp is guaranteed to be unique and monotonically increasing.
     * Default value: -1. The timestamp will be updated after each {@link
     * #ioReceive ioReceive()} call.
     *
     * It can be used to identify the images by comparing the unique timestamps
     * when used with {@link android.hardware.camera2} APIs.
     * Example steps:
     *   1. Save {@link android.hardware.camera2.TotalCaptureResult} when the
     *      capture is completed.
     *   2. Get the timestamp after {@link #ioReceive ioReceive()} call.
     *   3. Comparing totalCaptureResult.get(CaptureResult.SENSOR_TIMESTAMP) with
     *      alloc.getTimeStamp().
     * @return long Timestamp associated with the buffer held by the Allocation.
