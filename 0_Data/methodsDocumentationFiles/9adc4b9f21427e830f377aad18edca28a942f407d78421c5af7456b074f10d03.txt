     * Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the
     * current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call
     * this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and
     * therefore you can skip making the draw calls).
     *
     * @param rect  the rect to compare with the current clip
     * @param type  {@link Canvas.EdgeType#AA} if the path should be considered antialiased,
     *              since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than
     *              non-antialiased ({@link Canvas.EdgeType#BW}).
     * @return      true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix)
     *              does not intersect with the canvas' clip
     * @deprecated The EdgeType is ignored. Use {@link #quickReject(RectF)} instead.
