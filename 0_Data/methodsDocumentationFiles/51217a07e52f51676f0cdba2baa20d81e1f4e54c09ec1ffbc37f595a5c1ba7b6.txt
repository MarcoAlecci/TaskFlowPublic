     * Returns a string in the canonical IPv4 format ###.###.###.### from a packed integer
     * containing the IP address. The IPv4 address is expected to be in little-endian
     * format (LSB first). That is, 0x01020304 will return "4.3.2.1".
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link java.net.InetAddress#getHostAddress()}, which supports both IPv4 and
     *     IPv6 addresses. This method does not support IPv6 addresses.
