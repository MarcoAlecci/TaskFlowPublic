     * Version of {@link #sendBroadcast(Intent)} that allows you to
     * receive data back from the broadcast.  This is accomplished by
     * supplying your own BroadcastReceiver when calling, which will be
     * treated as a final receiver at the end of the broadcast -- its
     * {@link BroadcastReceiver#onReceive} method will be called with
     * the result values collected from the other receivers.  The broadcast will
     * be serialized in the same way as calling
     * {@link #sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)}.
     *
     * <p>Like {@link #sendBroadcast(Intent)}, this method is
     * asynchronous; it will return before
     * resultReceiver.onReceive() is called.
     *
     * <p>See {@link BroadcastReceiver} for more information on Intent broadcasts.
     *
     * @param intent The Intent to broadcast; all receivers matching this
     *               Intent will receive the broadcast.
     * @param receiverPermission String naming a permissions that
     *               a receiver must hold in order to receive your broadcast.

     * @param resultReceiver Your own BroadcastReceiver to treat as the final
     *                       receiver of the broadcast.
     * @param scheduler A custom Handler with which to schedule the
     *                  resultReceiver callback; if null it will be
     *                  scheduled in the Context's main thread.
     * @param initialCode An initial value for the result code.  Often
     *                    Activity.RESULT_OK.
     * @param initialData An initial value for the result data.  Often
     *                    null.
     * @param initialExtras An initial value for the result extras.  Often
     *                      null.
