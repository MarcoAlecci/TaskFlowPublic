     * <p>This method is typically called by {@link View Views} that manage virtual views; for
     * example, when the view is rendering an {@code HTML} page with a form and virtual views
     * that represent the HTML elements, it should call this method after the form is submitted and
     * another page is rendered.

     * <p><b>Note:</b> This method does not need to be called on regular application lifecycle
     * methods such as {@link android.app.Activity#finish()}.
