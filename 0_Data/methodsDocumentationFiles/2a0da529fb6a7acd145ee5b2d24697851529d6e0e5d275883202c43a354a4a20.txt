     * Computes the Julian day number for a point in time in a particular
     * timezone. The Julian day for a given calendar date is the same for
     * every timezone. For example, the Julian day for July 1, 2008 is
     * 2454649.
     *
     * <p>Callers must pass the time in UTC millisecond (as can be returned
     * by {@link #toMillis(boolean)} or {@link #normalize(boolean)})
     * and the offset from UTC of the timezone in seconds at that time (as
     * might be in {@link #gmtoff}).
     *
     * <p>The Julian day is useful for testing if two events occur on the
     * same calendar date and for determining the relative time of an event
     * from the present ("yesterday", "3 days ago", etc.).
     *
     * @param millis the time in UTC milliseconds
     * @param gmtoffSeconds the offset from UTC in seconds
     * @return the Julian day
     * @deprecated Use {@link java.time.temporal.JulianFields#JULIAN_DAY} instead.
