     * Queues the request to send or receive data on its endpoint.
     * <p>For OUT endpoints, the given buffer data will be sent on the endpoint. For IN endpoints,
     * the endpoint will attempt to read the given number of bytes into the specified buffer. If the
     * queueing operation is successful, return true. The result will be returned via
     * {@link UsbDeviceConnection#requestWait}</p>
     *
     * @param buffer the buffer containing the bytes to write, or location to store the results of a
     *               read. Position and array offset will be ignored and assumed to be 0. Limit and
     *               capacity will be ignored. Once the request
     *               {@link UsbDeviceConnection#requestWait() is processed} the position will be set
     *               to the number of bytes read/written.
     * @param length number of bytes to read or write. Before {@value Build.VERSION_CODES#P}, a
     *               value larger than 16384 bytes would be truncated down to 16384. In API
     *               {@value Build.VERSION_CODES#P} and after, any value of length is valid.
     *
     * @return true if the queueing operation succeeded
     *
     * @deprecated Use {@link #queue(ByteBuffer)} instead.
