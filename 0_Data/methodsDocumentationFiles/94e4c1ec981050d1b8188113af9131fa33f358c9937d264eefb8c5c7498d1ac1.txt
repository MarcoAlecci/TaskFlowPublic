     * Convenience method for deleting rows in the database.
     *
     * @param table the table to delete from
     * @param whereClause the optional WHERE clause to apply when deleting.
     *            Passing null will delete all rows.
     * @param whereArgs You may include ?s in the where clause, which
     *            will be replaced by the values from whereArgs. The values
     *            will be bound as Strings.
     * @return the number of rows affected if a whereClause is passed in, 0
     *         otherwise. To remove all rows and get a count pass "1" as the
     *         whereClause.
