     * Gets the number or symbol associated with the key.
     * <p>
     * The character value is returned, not the numeric value.
     * If the key is not a number, but is a symbol, the symbol is retuned.
     * </p><p>
     * This method is intended to to support dial pads and other numeric or
     * symbolic entry on keyboards where certain keys serve dual function
     * as alphabetic and symbolic keys.  This method returns the number
     * or symbol associated with the key independent of whether the user
     * has pressed the required modifier.
     * </p><p>
     * For example, on one particular keyboard the keys on the top QWERTY row generate
     * numbers when ALT is pressed such that ALT-Q maps to '1'.  So for that keyboard
     * when {@link #getNumber} is called with {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_Q} it returns '1'
     * so that the user can type numbers without pressing ALT when it makes sense.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return The associated numeric or symbolic character, or 0 if none.
