     * The user capabilities of one or multiple contacts have been requested by the framework.
     * <p>
     * The implementer must follow up this call with an {@link #onCommandUpdate(int, int)} call to
     * indicate whether or not this operation succeeded.  If this operation succeeds, network
     * response updates should be sent to the framework using
     * {@link #onNetworkResponse(int, String, int)}. When the operation is completed,
     * {@link #onCapabilityRequestResponse(List, int)} should be called with the presence
     * information for the contacts specified.
     * @param uris A {@link List} of the {@link Uri}s that the framework is requesting the UCE
     *             capabilities for.
     * @param operationToken The token associated with this operation. Updates to this request using
     *         {@link #onCommandUpdate(int, int)}, {@link #onNetworkResponse(int, String, int)}, and
     *         {@link #onCapabilityRequestResponse(List, int)}  must use the same operation token
     *         in response.
