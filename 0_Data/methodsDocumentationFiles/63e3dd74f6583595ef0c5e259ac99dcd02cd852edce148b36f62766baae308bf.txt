     *
     * <p>Insets are considered "consumed" if the applicable <code>consume*</code> methods
     * have been called such that all insets have been set to zero. This affects propagation of
     * insets through the view hierarchy; insets that have not been fully consumed will continue
     * to propagate down to child views.</p>
     *
     * <p>The result of this method is equivalent to the return value of
     * {@link View#fitSystemWindows(android.graphics.Rect)}.</p>
     *
     * @return true if the insets have been fully consumed.
