     * Called to send MIDI data to the receiver without a timestamp.
     * Data will be processed by receiver in the order sent.
     * Data will get split into multiple calls to {@link #onSend} if count exceeds
     * {@link #getMaxMessageSize}.  Blocks until all the data is sent or an exception occurs.
     * In the latter case, the amount of data sent prior to the exception is not provided to caller.

     * communication, reset all controllers and send all notes off.
