     * This is called due to a corresponding call to your
     * {@link InputMethod#showSoftInput InputMethod.showSoftInput()}

     * {@link #onEvaluateInputViewShown()}, {@link #onEvaluateFullscreenMode()},
     * and the current configuration to decide whether the input view should
     * be shown at this point.
     * 
     * @param flags Provides additional information about the show request,
     * as per {@link InputMethod#showSoftInput InputMethod.showSoftInput()}.
     * @param configChange This is true if we are re-showing due to a
     * configuration change.
     * @return Returns true to indicate that the window should be shown.
