     * Force an asynchronous load. Unlike {@link #startLoading()} this will ignore a previously
     * loaded data set and load a new one.  This simply calls through to the
     * implementation's {@link #onForceLoad()}.  You generally should only call this
     * when the loader is started -- that is, {@link #isStarted()} returns true.
     *
     * <p>Must be called from the process's main thread.
