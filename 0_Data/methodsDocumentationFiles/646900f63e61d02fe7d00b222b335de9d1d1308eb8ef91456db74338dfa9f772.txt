     * Gets the time offset at which the measurement was taken in nanoseconds.
     *
     * <p>The reference receiver's time from which this is offset is specified by
     * {@link GnssClock#getTimeNanos()}.
     *
     * <p>The sign of this value is given by the following equation:
     * <pre>
     *      measurement time = TimeNanos + TimeOffsetNanos</pre>
     *
     * <p>The value provides an individual time-stamp for the measurement, and allows sub-nanosecond
     * accuracy.
