     * Tunes to a given channel for TV program recording. The first tune request will create a new
     * recording session for the corresponding TV input and establish a connection between the
     * application and the session. If recording has already started in the current recording
     * session, this method throws an exception. This can be used to provide domain-specific
     * features that are only known between certain client and their TV inputs.
     *
     * <p>The application may call this method before starting or after stopping recording, but not
     * during recording.
     *
     * <p>The recording session will respond by calling
     * {@link RecordingCallback#onTuned(Uri)} if the tune request was fulfilled, or
     * {@link RecordingCallback#onError(int)} otherwise.
     *
     * @param inputId The ID of the TV input for the given channel.
     * @param channelUri The URI of a channel.
     * @param params Domain-specific data for this tune request. Keys <em>must</em> be a scoped
     *            name, i.e. prefixed with a package name you own, so that different developers will
     *            not create conflicting keys.
     * @throws IllegalStateException If recording is already started.
