     * Authenticate a sector with key B.
     *
     * <p>Successful authentication of a sector with key B enables other
     * I/O operations on that sector. The set of operations granted by key B
     * depends on the ACL bits set in that sector. For more information
     * see the MIFARE Classic specification on <a href="http://www.nxp.com">http://www.nxp.com</a>.
     *
     * <p>A failed authentication attempt causes an implicit reconnection to the
     * tag, so authentication to other sectors will be lost.
     *
     * <p>This is an I/O operation and will block until complete. It must
     * not be called from the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
     * {@link IOException} if {@link #close} is called from another thread.
     *
     * <p class="note">Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#NFC} permission.
