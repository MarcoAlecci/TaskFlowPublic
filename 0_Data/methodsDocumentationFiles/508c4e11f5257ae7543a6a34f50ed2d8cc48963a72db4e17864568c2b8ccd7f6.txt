     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} instance with the same value as {@code
     * this} but with a unscaled value where the trailing zeros have been
     * removed. If the unscaled value of {@code this} has n trailing zeros, then
     * the scale and the precision of the result has been reduced by n.
     *
     * @return a new {@code BigDecimal} instance equivalent to this where the
     *         trailing zeros of the unscaled value have been removed.
