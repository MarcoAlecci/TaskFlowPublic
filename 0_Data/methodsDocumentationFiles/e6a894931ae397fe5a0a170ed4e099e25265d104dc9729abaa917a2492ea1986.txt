     * Detach the SurfaceTexture from the OpenGL ES context that owns the OpenGL ES texture object.
     * This call must be made with the OpenGL ES context current on the calling thread.  The OpenGL
     * ES texture object will be deleted as a result of this call.  After calling this method all
     * calls to {@link #updateTexImage} will throw an {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException} until
     * a successful call to {@link #attachToGLContext} is made.
     * <p>
     * This can be used to access the SurfaceTexture image contents from multiple OpenGL ES
     * contexts.  Note, however, that the image contents are only accessible from one OpenGL ES
     * context at a time.
