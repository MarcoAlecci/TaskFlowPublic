     * <p>Sets the time from the given Julian day number, which must be based on
     * the same timezone that is set in this Time object.  The "gmtoff" field
     * need not be initialized because the given Julian day may have a different
     * GMT offset than whatever is currently stored in this Time object anyway.
     * After this method returns all the fields will be normalized and the time
     * will be set to 12am at the beginning of the given Julian day.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The only exception to this is if 12am does not exist for that day because
     * of daylight saving time.  For example, Cairo, Eqypt moves time ahead one
     * hour at 12am on April 25, 2008 and there are a few other places that
     * also change daylight saving time at 12am.  In those cases, the time
     * will be set to 1am.
