     * Flushes this encoder.
     *
     * <p> Some encoders maintain internal state and may need to write some
     * final bytes to the output buffer once the overall input sequence has
     * been read.
     *
     * <p> Any additional output is written to the output buffer beginning at
     * its current position.  At most {@link Buffer#remaining out.remaining()}
     * bytes will be written.  The buffer's position will be advanced
     * appropriately, but its mark and limit will not be modified.
     *
     * <p> If this method completes successfully then it returns {@link
     * CoderResult#UNDERFLOW}.  If there is insufficient room in the output
     * buffer then it returns {@link CoderResult#OVERFLOW}.  If this happens
     * then this method must be invoked again, with an output buffer that has
     * more room, in order to complete the current <a href="#steps">encoding
     * operation</a>.
     *
     * <p> If this encoder has already been flushed then invoking this method
     * has no effect.
     *
     * <p> This method invokes the {@link #implFlush implFlush} method to
     * perform the actual flushing operation.  </p>
