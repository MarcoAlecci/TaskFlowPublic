     * Retrieve the logo associated with an Intent.  If intent.getClassName() is
     * set, this simply returns the result of
     * getActivityLogo(intent.getClassName()).  Otherwise it resolves the intent's
     * component and returns the logo associated with the resolved component.
     * If intent.getClassName() cannot be found or the Intent cannot be resolved
     * to a component, NameNotFoundException is thrown.
     *
     * @param intent The intent for which you would like to retrieve a logo.
     *
     * @return Returns the image of the logo, or null if the activity has no
     * logo specified.
     *
     * @throws NameNotFoundException Thrown if the resources for application
     * matching the given intent could not be loaded.
