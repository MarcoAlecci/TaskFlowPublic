         * <p>LayoutManagers may want to perform a lightweight detach operation to rearrange
         * views currently attached to the RecyclerView. Generally LayoutManager implementations
         * will want to use {@link #detachAndScrapView(android.view.View, RecyclerView.Recycler)}
         * so that the detached view may be rebound and reused.</p>
         *
         * <p>If a LayoutManager uses this method to detach a view, it <em>must</em>
         * {@link #attachView(android.view.View, int, RecyclerView.LayoutParams) reattach}
         * or {@link #removeDetachedView(android.view.View) fully remove} the detached view
         * before the LayoutManager entry point method called by RecyclerView returns.</p>

         * @param child Child to detach
