     * Returns the absolute path to the application specific cache directory on
     * the filesystem.
     * <p>
     * The system will automatically delete files in this directory as disk
     * space is needed elsewhere on the device. The system will always delete
     * older files first, as reported by {@link File#lastModified()}. If
     * desired, you can exert more control over how files are deleted using
     * {@link StorageManager#setCacheBehaviorGroup(File, boolean)} and
     * {@link StorageManager#setCacheBehaviorTombstone(File, boolean)}.
     * <p>
     * Apps are strongly encouraged to keep their usage of cache space below the
     * quota returned by
     * {@link StorageManager#getCacheQuotaBytes(java.util.UUID)}. If your app
     * goes above this quota, your cached files will be some of the first to be
     * deleted when additional disk space is needed. Conversely, if your app
     * stays under this quota, your cached files will be some of the last to be
     * deleted when additional disk space is needed.
     * <p>
     * Note that your cache quota will change over time depending on how
     * frequently the user interacts with your app, and depending on how much
     * system-wide disk space is used.
     * <p>
     * The returned path may change over time if the calling app is moved to an
     * adopted storage device, so only relative paths should be persisted.
     * <p>
     * Apps require no extra permissions to read or write to the returned path,
     * since this path lives in their private storage.
