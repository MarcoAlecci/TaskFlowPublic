     * If set to true, this indicates to the system that it should never take a
     * screenshot of the activity to be used as a representation while it is not in a started state.
     * <p>
     * Note that the system may use the window background of the theme instead to represent
     * the window when it is not running.
     * <p>
     * Also note that in comparison to {@link android.view.WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_SECURE},
     * this only affects the behavior when the activity's screenshot would be used as a
     * representation when the activity is not in a started state, i.e. in Overview. The system may
     * still take screenshots of the activity in other contexts; for example, when the user takes a
     * screenshot of the entire screen, or when the active
     * {@link android.service.voice.VoiceInteractionService} requests a screenshot via
     * {@link android.service.voice.VoiceInteractionSession#SHOW_WITH_SCREENSHOT}.
     *
     * @param disable {@code true} to disable preview screenshots; {@code false} otherwise.
     * @hide
