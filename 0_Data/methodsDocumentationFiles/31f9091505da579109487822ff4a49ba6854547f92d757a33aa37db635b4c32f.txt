     * If the device is currently locked (see {@link #isKeyguardLocked()}, requests the Keyguard to
     * be dismissed.
     * <p>
     * If the Keyguard is not secure or the device is currently in a trusted state, calling this
     * method will immediately dismiss the Keyguard without any user interaction.
     * <p>
     * If the Keyguard is secure and the device is not in a trusted state, this will bring up the
     * UI so the user can enter their credentials.
     * <p>
     * If the value set for the {@link Activity} attr {@link android.R.attr#turnScreenOn} is true,
     * the screen will turn on when the keyguard is dismissed.
     *
     * @param activity The activity requesting the dismissal. The activity must be either visible
     *                 by using {@link LayoutParams#FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED} or must be in a state in
     *                 which it would be visible if Keyguard would not be hiding it. If that's not
     *                 the case, the request will fail immediately and
     *                 {@link KeyguardDismissCallback#onDismissError} will be invoked.
     * @param callback The callback to be called if the request to dismiss Keyguard was successful
     *                 or {@code null} if the caller isn't interested in knowing the result. The
     *                 callback will not be invoked if the activity was destroyed before the
     *                 callback was received.
