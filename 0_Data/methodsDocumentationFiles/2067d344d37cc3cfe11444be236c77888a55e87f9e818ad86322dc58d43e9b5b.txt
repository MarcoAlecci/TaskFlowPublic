     * method will scroll the view to the top or bottom and give the focus
     * to the topmost/bottommost component in the new visible area. If no
     * component is a good candidate for focus, this scrollview reclaims the
     * focus.</p>

     *                  {@link android.view.View#FOCUS_DOWN} to go the bottom
     * @return true if the key event is consumed by this method, false otherwise
