     * Sets the iterator to point to the collation element corresponding to
     * the specified character (the parameter is a CHARACTER offset in the
     * original string, not an offset into its corresponding sequence of
     * collation elements).  The value returned by the next call to next()
     * will be the collation element corresponding to the specified position
     * in the text.  If that position is in the middle of a contracting
     * character sequence, the result of the next call to next() is the
     * collation element for that sequence.  This means that getOffset()
     * is not guaranteed to return the same value as was passed to a preceding
     * call to setOffset().
     *
     * @param newOffset The new character offset into the original text.
