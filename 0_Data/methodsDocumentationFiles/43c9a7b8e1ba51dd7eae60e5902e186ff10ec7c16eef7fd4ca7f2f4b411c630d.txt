     * Called when a fragment is being created as part of a view layout
     * inflation, typically from setting the content view of an activity.  This
     * may be called immediately after the fragment is created from a <fragment>
     * tag in a layout file.  Note this is <em>before</em> the fragment's
     * {@link #onAttach(Activity)} has been called; all you should do here is
     * parse the attributes and save them away.
     *
     * <p>This is called every time the fragment is inflated, even if it is
     * being inflated into a new instance with saved state.  It typically makes
     * sense to re-parse the parameters each time, to allow them to change with
     * different configurations.</p>
     *
     * <p>Here is a typical implementation of a fragment that can take parameters
     * both through attributes supplied here as well from {@link #getArguments()}:</p>
     *
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentArguments.java
     *      fragment}
     *
     * <p>Note that parsing the XML attributes uses a "styleable" resource.  The
     * declaration for the styleable used here is:</p>
     *
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/values/attrs.xml fragment_arguments}
     *
     * <p>The fragment can then be declared within its activity's content layout
     * through a tag like this:</p>
     *
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/layout/fragment_arguments.xml from_attributes}
     *
     * <p>This fragment can also be created dynamically from arguments given
     * at runtime in the arguments Bundle; here is an example of doing so at
     * creation of the containing activity:</p>
     *
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentArguments.java
     *      create}
     *
     * @param context The Context that is inflating this fragment.
     * @param attrs The attributes at the tag where the fragment is
     * being created.
     * @param savedInstanceState If the fragment is being re-created from
     * a previous saved state, this is the state.
