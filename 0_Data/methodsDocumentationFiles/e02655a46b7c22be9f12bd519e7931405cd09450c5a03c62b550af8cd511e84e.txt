     * Set the default response for future runtime permission requests by applications. This
     * function can be called by a device owner, profile owner, or by a delegate given the
     * {@link #DELEGATION_PERMISSION_GRANT} scope via {@link #setDelegatedScopes}.
     * The policy can allow for normal operation which prompts the user to grant a permission, or
     * can allow automatic granting or denying of runtime permission requests by an application.
     * This also applies to new permissions declared by app updates. When a permission is denied or
     * granted this way, the effect is equivalent to setting the permission * grant state via
     * {@link #setPermissionGrantState}.
     * <p/>
     * As this policy only acts on runtime permission requests, it only applies to applications
     * built with a {@code targetSdkVersion} of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M} or later.
