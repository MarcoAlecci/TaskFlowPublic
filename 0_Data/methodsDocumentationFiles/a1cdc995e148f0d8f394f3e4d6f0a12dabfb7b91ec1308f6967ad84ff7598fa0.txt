     * Returns whether the node is explicitly marked as a focusable unit by a screen reader. Note
     * that {@code false} indicates that it is not explicitly marked, not that the node is not
     * a focusable unit. Screen readers should generally use other signals, such as
     * {@link #isFocusable()}, or the presence of text in a node, to determine what should receive
     * focus.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the node is specifically marked as a focusable unit for screen
     *         readers, {@code false} otherwise.
