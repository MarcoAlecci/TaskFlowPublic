     * Stop qemu tracing.  See {@link #startNativeTracing()} to start tracing.

     * <p>Tracing can be started and stopped as many times as desired.  When
     * the qemu emulator itself is stopped then the buffered trace records
     * are flushed and written to the trace file.  In fact, it is not necessary
     * to call this method at all; simply killing qemu is sufficient.  But
     * starting and stopping a trace is useful for examining a specific
     * region of code.</p>
