     * This function will normally be called for you automatically by
     * {@link android.app.LoaderManager} when destroying a Loader.  When using
     * a Loader with {@link android.app.LoaderManager},
     * you <em>must not</em> call this method yourself, or you will conflict
     * with its management of the Loader.
     *
     * Resets the state of the Loader.  The Loader should at this point free
     * all of its resources, since it may never be called again; however, its
     * {@link #startLoading()} may later be called at which point it must be
     * able to start running again.
     *
     * <p>This updates the Loader's internal state so that
     * {@link #isStarted()} and {@link #isReset()} will return the correct
     * values, and then calls the implementation's {@link #onReset()}.
     *
     * <p>Must be called from the process's main thread.
