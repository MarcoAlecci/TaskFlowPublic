         * Multiple transports may be added. Note that when searching for a network to satisfy a
         * request, satisfying any of the transports listed in the request will satisfy the request.
         * For example {@code TRANSPORT_WIFI} and {@code TRANSPORT_ETHERNET} added to a
         * {@code NetworkCapabilities} would cause either a Wi-Fi network or an Ethernet network
         * to be selected. This is logically different than
         * {@code NetworkCapabilities.NET_CAPABILITY_*}.

         * @param transportType the transport type to be added or removed.
