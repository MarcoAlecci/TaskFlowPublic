     * Returns a string representation of the contents of the specified array.
     * If the array contains other arrays as elements, they are converted to
     * strings by the {@link Object#toString} method inherited from
     * <tt>Object</tt>, which describes their <i>identities</i> rather than
     * their contents.
     *
     * <p>The value returned by this method is equal to the value that would
     * be returned by <tt>Arrays.asList(a).toString()</tt>, unless <tt>a</tt>
     * is <tt>null</tt>, in which case <tt>"null"</tt> is returned.
     *
     * @param a the array whose string representation to return
     * @return a string representation of <tt>a</tt>
