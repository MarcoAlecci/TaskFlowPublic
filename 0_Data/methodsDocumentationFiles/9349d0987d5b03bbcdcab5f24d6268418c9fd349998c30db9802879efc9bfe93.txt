     * Indicates whether this ViewGroup will always try to draw its children using their
     * drawing cache. This property can be set to true when the cache rendering is
     * slightly different from the children's normal rendering. Renderings can be different,
     * for instance, when the cache's quality is set to low.
     *
     * When this property is disabled, the ViewGroup will use the drawing cache of its
     * children only when asked to. It's usually the task of subclasses to tell ViewGroup
     * when to start using the drawing cache and when to stop using it.
     *
     * @param always true to always draw with the drawing cache, false otherwise

     * @deprecated As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M}, this property is ignored.
     * Child views may no longer have their caching behavior disabled by parents.
