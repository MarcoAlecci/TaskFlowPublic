     * Open a raw file descriptor to access (potentially type transformed)
     * data from a "content:" URI.  This interacts with the underlying
     * {@link ContentProvider#openTypedAssetFile} method of the provider
     * associated with the given URI, to retrieve retrieve any appropriate
     * data stream for the data stored there.
     *
     * <p>Unlike {@link #openAssetFileDescriptor}, this function only works
     * with "content:" URIs, because content providers are the only facility
     * with an associated MIME type to ensure that the returned data stream
     * is of the desired type.
     *
     * <p>All text/* streams are encoded in UTF-8.
     *
     * @param uri The desired URI to open.
     * @param mimeType The desired MIME type of the returned data.  This can
     * be a pattern such as *&#47;*, which will allow the content provider to
     * select a type, though there is no way for you to determine what type
     * it is returning.
     * @param opts Additional provider-dependent options.
     * @return Returns a new ParcelFileDescriptor from which you can read the
     * data stream from the provider or {@code null} if the provider recently crashed.
     * Note that this may be a pipe, meaning you can't seek in it.  The only seek you
     * should do is if the AssetFileDescriptor contains an offset, to move to that offset before
     * reading.  You own this descriptor and are responsible for closing it when done.
     * @throws FileNotFoundException Throws FileNotFoundException of no
     * data of the desired type exists under the URI.
