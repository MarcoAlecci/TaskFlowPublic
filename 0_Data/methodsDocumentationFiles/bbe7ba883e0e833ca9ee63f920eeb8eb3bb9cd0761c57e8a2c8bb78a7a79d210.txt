         * Sets multiple intents instead of a single intent, in order to launch an activity with
         * other activities in back stack.  Use {@link TaskStackBuilder} to build intents. The
         * last element in the list represents the only intent that doesn't place an activity on
         * the back stack.
         * See the {@link ShortcutManager} javadoc for details.
