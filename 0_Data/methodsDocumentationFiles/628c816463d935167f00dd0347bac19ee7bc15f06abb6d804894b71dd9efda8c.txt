     * Returns a {@code BigInteger} which has the same binary representation
     * as {@code this} but with the bit at position n flipped. The result is
     * equivalent to {@code this ^ pow(2, n)}.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Note:</b> Usage of this method is not recommended as
     * the current implementation is not efficient.
     *
     * @param n position where the bit in {@code this} has to be flipped.
     * @throws ArithmeticException if {@code n < 0}.
