     * <p>Compares the two specified half-precision float values. The following
     * conditions apply during the comparison:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #NaN} is considered by this method to be equal to itself and greater
     * than all other half-precision float values (including {@code #POSITIVE_INFINITY})</li>
     * <li>{@link #POSITIVE_ZERO} is considered by this method to be greater than
     * {@link #NEGATIVE_ZERO}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param h The half-precision float value to compare to the half-precision value
     *          represented by this {@code Half} object
     *
     * @return  The value {@code 0} if {@code x} is numerically equal to {@code y}; a
     *          value less than {@code 0} if {@code x} is numerically less than {@code y};
     *          and a value greater than {@code 0} if {@code x} is numerically greater
     *          than {@code y}
