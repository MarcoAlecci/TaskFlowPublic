         * peer's video have changed.
         * <p>
         * This could occur if, for example, the peer rotates their device, changing the aspect
         * ratio of the video, or if the user switches between the back and front cameras.
         * <p>
         * Received by the {@link InCallService} via
         * {@link InCallService.VideoCall.Callback#onPeerDimensionsChanged(int, int)}.
         *
         * @param width  The updated peer video width.
