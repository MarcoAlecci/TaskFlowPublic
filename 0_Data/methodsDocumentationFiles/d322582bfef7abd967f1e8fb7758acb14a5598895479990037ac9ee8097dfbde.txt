     * Given a Cursor that was previously given to
     * {@link #startManagingCursor}, stop the activity's management of that
     * cursor.
     *
     * <p><strong>Warning:</strong> After calling this method on a cursor from a managed query,
     * the system <em>will not</em> automatically close the cursor and you must call
     * {@link Cursor#close()}.</p>
     *
     * @param c The Cursor that was being managed.
     *
     * @see #startManagingCursor
     *
     * @deprecated Use the new {@link android.content.CursorLoader} class with
     * {@link LoaderManager} instead; this is also
     * available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.
