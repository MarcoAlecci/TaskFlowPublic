     * Provide a Path to interpolate between two points <code>(startX, startY)</code> and
     * <code>(endX, endY)</code>. This allows controlled curved motion along two dimensions.
     *
     * @param startX The x coordinate of the starting point.
     * @param startY The y coordinate of the starting point.
     * @param endX   The x coordinate of the ending point.
     * @param endY   The y coordinate of the ending point.
     * @return A Path along which the points should be interpolated. The returned Path
     * must start at point <code>(startX, startY)</code>, typically using
     * {@link android.graphics.Path#moveTo(float, float)} and end at <code>(endX, endY)</code>.
