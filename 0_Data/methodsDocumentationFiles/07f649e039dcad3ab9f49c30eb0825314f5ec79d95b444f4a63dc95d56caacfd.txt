     * Converts this abstract pathname into a <code>file:</code> URL.  The
     * exact form of the URL is system-dependent.  If it can be determined that
     * the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory, then the
     * resulting URL will end with a slash.
     *
     * @return  A URL object representing the equivalent file URL
     *
     * @throws  MalformedURLException

     * @deprecated This method does not automatically escape characters that
     * are illegal in URLs.  It is recommended that new code convert an
     * abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the
     * {@link #toURI() toURI} method, and then converting the URI into a URL
     * via the {@link java.net.URI#toURL() URI.toURL} method.
