     * Removes a network address from the VPN interface.
     *
     * Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. The VPN must already be established. Fails if the
     * address is not assigned to the VPN interface, or if it is the only address assigned (thus
     * cannot be removed), or if the address cannot be removed for any other reason.
     *
     * After removing an address, if there are no addresses, routes or DNS servers of a particular
     * address family (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6) configured on the VPN, that <b>DOES NOT</b> block that
     * family from being routed. In other words, once an address family has been allowed, it stays
     * allowed for the rest of the VPN's session. @see Builder#allowFamily
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the address is invalid.
     *
     * @param address The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) to assign to the VPN interface.
     * @param prefixLength The prefix length of the address.
     *
     * @return {@code true} on success.
