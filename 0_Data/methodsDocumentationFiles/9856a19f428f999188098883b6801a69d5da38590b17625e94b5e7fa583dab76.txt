     * The result is guaranteed to include the default Locale returned by Locale.getDefault(), but
     * not necessarily at the top of the list. The default locale not being at the top of the list
     * is an indication that the system has set the default locale to one of the user's other
     * preferred locales, having concluded that the primary preference is not supported but a
     * secondary preference is.
     *
     * <p>Note that the default LocaleList would change if Locale.setDefault() is called. This
     * method takes that into account by always checking the output of Locale.getDefault() and
     * recalculating the default LocaleList if needed.</p>
