     * @return The next decoded {@link Asn1Node}. If success, the next decoding position will also
     *         be updated. If any error happens, e.g., moving over the end position, {@code null}
     *         will be returned and the next decoding position won't be modified.
     * @throws InvalidAsn1DataException If the bytes cannot be parsed.
