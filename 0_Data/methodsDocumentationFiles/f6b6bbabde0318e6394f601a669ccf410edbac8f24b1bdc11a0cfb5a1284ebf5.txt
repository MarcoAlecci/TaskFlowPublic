     * <p>
     * E.g. if a {@code <} b {@code <} c {@code <} d, the
     * extension of [a, c] and [b, d] ranges is [a, d].
     * As the endpoints are object references, there is no guarantee
     * which specific endpoint reference is used from the input ranges:</p>
     * <p>
     * E.g. if a {@code ==} a' {@code <} b {@code <} c, the
     * extension of [a, b] and [a', c] ranges could be either
     * [a, c] or ['a, c], where ['a, c] could be either the exact
     * input range, or a newly created range with the same endpoints.</p>

     * @param range a non-{@code null} {@code Range<T>} reference
     * @return the extension of this range and the other range.

     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code range} was {@code null}
