     * Is this device non default block encrypted and in the process of
     * prompting for credentials?
     * @return true for prompting for credentials.
     *         (Implies isNonDefaultBlockEncrypted() == true)
     *         false otherwise
     * Note that only system services and CryptKeeper will ever see this return
     * true - no app will ever be launched in this state.
     * Also note that this state will not change without a teardown of the
     * framework, so no service needs to check for changes during their lifespan
