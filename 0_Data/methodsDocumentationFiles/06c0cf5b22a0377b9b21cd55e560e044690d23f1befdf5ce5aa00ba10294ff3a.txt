     * Sets the delay, as a fraction of the animation duration, by which the
     * children's animations are offset. The general formula is:
     *
     * <pre>
     * child animation delay = child index * delay * animation duration
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param delay a fraction of the animation duration
     *
     * @see #getDelay()
