     * Check whether the called view is a text editor, in which case it
     * would make sense to automatically display a soft input window for
     * it.  Subclasses should override this if they implement
     * {@link #onCreateInputConnection(EditorInfo)} to return true if
     * a call on that method would return a non-null InputConnection, and
     * they are really a first-class editor that the user would normally
     * start typing on when the go into a window containing your view.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation always returns false.  This does
     * <em>not</em> mean that its {@link #onCreateInputConnection(EditorInfo)}
     * will not be called or the user can not otherwise perform edits on your
     * view; it is just a hint to the system that this is not the primary
     * purpose of this view.
     *
     * @return Returns true if this view is a text editor, else false.
