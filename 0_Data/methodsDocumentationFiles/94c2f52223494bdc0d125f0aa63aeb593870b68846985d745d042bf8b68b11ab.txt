     * Returns a dup'd ParcelFileDescriptor from the SharedMemory FileDescriptor.
     * This obeys standard POSIX semantics, where the
     * new file descriptor shared state such as file position with the
     * original file descriptor.
     * TODO: propose this method as a public or system API for next release to achieve parity with
     *  NDK ASharedMemory_dupFromJava.
