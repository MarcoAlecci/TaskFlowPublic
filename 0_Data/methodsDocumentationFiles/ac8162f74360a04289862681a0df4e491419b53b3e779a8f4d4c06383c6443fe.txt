         * @param overridesImplicitlyEnabledSubtype should be true if this subtype should be
         * enabled by default if no other subtypes in the IME are enabled explicitly. Note that a
         * subtype with this parameter set will not be shown in the list of subtypes in each IME's
         * subtype enabler. A canonical use of this would be for an IME to supply an "automatic"
         * subtype that adapts to the current system language.
