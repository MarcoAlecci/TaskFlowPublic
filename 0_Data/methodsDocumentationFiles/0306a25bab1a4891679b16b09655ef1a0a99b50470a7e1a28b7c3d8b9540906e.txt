      * <p>
      * For historical reasons, the name of this method refers to the power state of
      * the screen but it actually describes the overall interactive state of
      * the device.  This method has been replaced by {@link #isInteractive}.
      * </p><p>
      * The value returned by this method only indicates whether the device is
      * in an interactive state which may have nothing to do with the screen being
      * on or off.  To determine the actual state of the screen,
      * use {@link android.view.Display#getState}.

      * @return True if the device is in an interactive state.

      * @deprecated Use {@link #isInteractive} instead.
