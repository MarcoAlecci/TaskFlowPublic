     * Set whether Telecom should treat this {@link Conference} as a multiparty conference call or
     * if it should treat it as a single-party call.
     * This method is used as part of a workaround regarding IMS conference calls and user
     * expectation.  In IMS, once a conference is formed, the UE is connected to an IMS conference
     * server.  If all participants of the conference drop out of the conference except for one, the
     * UE is still connected to the IMS conference server.  At this point, the user logically
     * assumes they're no longer in a conference, yet the underlying network actually is.
     * To help provide a better user experiece, IMS conference calls can pretend to actually be a
     * single-party call when the participant count drops to 1.  Although the dialer/phone app
     * could perform this trickery, it makes sense to do this in Telephony since a fix there will
     * ensure that bluetooth head units, auto and wearable apps all behave consistently.
     * <p>
     * This API is intended for use by the platform Telephony stack only.
