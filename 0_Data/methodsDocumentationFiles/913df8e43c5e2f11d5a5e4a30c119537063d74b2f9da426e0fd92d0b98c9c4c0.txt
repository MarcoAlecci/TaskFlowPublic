     * Plays silence for the specified amount of time using the specified
     * queue mode.
     * This method is asynchronous, i.e. the method just adds the request to the queue of TTS
     * requests and then returns. The synthesis might not have finished (or even started!) at the
     * time when this method returns. In order to reliably detect errors during synthesis,
     * we recommend setting an utterance progress listener (see
     * {@link #setOnUtteranceProgressListener}) and using the
     * {@link Engine#KEY_PARAM_UTTERANCE_ID} parameter.
     *
     * @param durationInMs The duration of the silence.
     * @param queueMode {@link #QUEUE_ADD} or {@link #QUEUE_FLUSH}.
     * @param utteranceId An unique identifier for this request.
     *
     * @return {@link #ERROR} or {@link #SUCCESS} of <b>queuing</b> the playSilentUtterance operation.
