     * @return one of {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_MOBILE}, {@link
     * ConnectivityManager#TYPE_WIFI}, {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_WIMAX}, {@link
     * ConnectivityManager#TYPE_ETHERNET},  {@link ConnectivityManager#TYPE_BLUETOOTH}, or other
     * types defined by {@link ConnectivityManager}.
     * @deprecated Callers should switch to checking {@link NetworkCapabilities#hasTransport}
     *             instead with one of the NetworkCapabilities#TRANSPORT_* constants :
     *             {@link #getType} and {@link #getTypeName} cannot account for networks using
     *             multiple transports. Note that generally apps should not care about transport;
     *             {@link NetworkCapabilities#NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_METERED} and
     *             {@link NetworkCapabilities#getLinkDownstreamBandwidthKbps} are calls that
     *             apps concerned with meteredness or bandwidth should be looking at, as they
     *             offer this information with much better accuracy.
