     * Report to the framework whether a network has working connectivity.
     * This provides a hint to the system that a particular network is providing
     * working connectivity or not.  In response the framework may re-evaluate
     * the network's connectivity and might take further action thereafter.
     *
     * @param network The {@link Network} the application was attempting to use
     *                or {@code null} to indicate the current default network.
     * @param hasConnectivity {@code true} if the application was able to successfully access the
     *                        Internet using {@code network} or {@code false} if not.
