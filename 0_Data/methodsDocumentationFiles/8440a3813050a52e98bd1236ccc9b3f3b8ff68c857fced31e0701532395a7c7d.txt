     * Returns whether the shared/external storage media is a
     * legacy view that includes files not owned by the app.
     * <p>
     * This value may be different from the value requested by
     * {@code requestLegacyExternalStorage} in the app's manifest, since an app
     * may inherit its legacy state based on when it was first installed, target sdk and other
     * factors.
     * <p>
     * Non-legacy apps can continue to discover and read media belonging to
     * other apps via {@link android.provider.MediaStore}.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the path is not a valid storage
     * device.
