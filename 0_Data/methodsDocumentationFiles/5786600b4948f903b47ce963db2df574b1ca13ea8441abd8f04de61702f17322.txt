     * A string that uniquely distinguishes this particular {@code PhoneAccountHandle} from all the
     * others supported by the connection service that created it.
     * <p>
     * A connection service must select identifiers that are stable for the lifetime of
     * their users' relationship with their service, across many Android devices. For example, a
     * good set of identifiers might be the email addresses with which with users registered for
     * their accounts with a particular service. Depending on how a service chooses to operate,
     * a bad set of identifiers might be an increasing series of integers
     * ({@code 0}, {@code 1}, {@code 2}, ...) that are generated locally on each phone and could
     * collide with values generated on other phones or after a data wipe of a given phone.
     *
     * Important: A non-unique identifier could cause non-deterministic call-log backup/restore
     * behavior.
     *
     * @return A service-specific unique identifier for this {@code PhoneAccountHandle}.
