         * Convenience function for retrieving a single secure settings value
         * as a floating point number.  Note that internally setting values are
         * always stored as strings; this function converts the string to an
         * float for you. The default value will be returned if the setting
         * is not defined or not a valid float.
         *
         * @param cr The ContentResolver to access.
         * @param name The name of the setting to retrieve.
         * @param def Value to return if the setting is not defined.
         *
         * @return The setting's current value, or 'def' if it is not defined
         * or not a valid float.
