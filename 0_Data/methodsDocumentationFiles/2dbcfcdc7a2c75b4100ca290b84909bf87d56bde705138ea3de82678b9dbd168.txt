     *
     * The text locale list affects how the text is drawn for some languages.
     *
     * For example, if the locale list contains {@link Locale#CHINESE} or {@link Locale#CHINA},
     * then the text renderer will prefer to draw text using a Chinese font. Likewise,
     * if the locale list contains {@link Locale#JAPANESE} or {@link Locale#JAPAN}, then the text
     * renderer will prefer to draw text using a Japanese font. If the locale list contains both,
     * the order those locales appear in the list is considered for deciding the font.
     *
     * This distinction is important because Chinese and Japanese text both use many
     * of the same Unicode code points but their appearance is subtly different for
     * each language.
     *
     * By default, the text locale list is initialized to a one-member list just containing the
     * system locales. This assumes that the text to be rendered will most likely be in the user's
     * preferred language.
     *
     * If the actual language or languages of the text is/are known, then they can be provided to
     * the text renderer using this method. The text renderer may attempt to guess the
     * language script based on the contents of the text to be drawn independent of
     * the text locale here. Specifying the text locales just helps it do a better
     * job in certain ambiguous cases.
     *
     * @param locales the paint's locale list for drawing text, must not be null or empty.
