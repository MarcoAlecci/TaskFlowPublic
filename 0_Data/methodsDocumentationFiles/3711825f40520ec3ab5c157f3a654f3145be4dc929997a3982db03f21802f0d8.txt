     * Force switch to a new input method and subtype. This can only be called
     * from an application or a service which has a token of the currently active input method.
     *
     * <p>On Android {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#Q} and later devices, {@code token} cannot be
     * {@code null} even with {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS}. Instead,
     * update {@link android.provider.Settings.Secure#DEFAULT_INPUT_METHOD} and
     * {@link android.provider.Settings.Secure#SELECTED_INPUT_METHOD_SUBTYPE} directly.</p>
     *
     * @param token Supplies the identifying token given to an input method
     * when it was started, which allows it to perform this operation on
     * itself.
     * @param id The unique identifier for the new input method to be switched to.
     * @param subtype The new subtype of the new input method to be switched to.
     * @deprecated Use
     * {@link InputMethodService#switchInputMethod(String, InputMethodSubtype)}
     * instead. This method was intended for IME developers who should be accessing APIs through
     * the service. APIs in this class are intended for app developers interacting with the IME.
