     * Checks if the specified context can draw on top of other apps. As of API
     * level 23, an app cannot draw on top of other apps unless it declares the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW} permission in its
     * manifest, <em>and</em> the user specifically grants the app this
     * capability. To prompt the user to grant this approval, the app must send an
     * intent with the action
     * {@link android.provider.Settings#ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION}, which
     * causes the system to display a permission management screen.
     *
     * @param context App context.
     * @return true if the specified context can draw on top of other apps, false otherwise
