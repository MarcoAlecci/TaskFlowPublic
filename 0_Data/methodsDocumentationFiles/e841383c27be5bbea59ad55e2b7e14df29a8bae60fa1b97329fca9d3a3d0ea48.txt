     * Special version of starting an activity, for use when you are replacing
     * other activity components.  You can use this to hand the Intent off
     * to the next Activity that can handle it.  You typically call this in
     * {@link #onCreate} with the Intent returned by {@link #getIntent}.
     *
     * @param intent The intent to dispatch to the next activity.  For
     * correct behavior, this must be the same as the Intent that started
     * your own activity; the only changes you can make are to the extras
     * inside of it.
     * @param options Additional options for how the Activity should be started.
     * See {@link android.content.Context#startActivity(Intent, Bundle)}
     * Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.
     *
     * @return Returns a boolean indicating whether there was another Activity
     * to start: true if there was a next activity to start, false if there
     * wasn't.  In general, if true is returned you will then want to call
     * finish() on yourself.
