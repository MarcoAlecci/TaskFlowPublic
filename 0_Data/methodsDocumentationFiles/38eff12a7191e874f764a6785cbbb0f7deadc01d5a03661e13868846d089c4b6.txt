     * Set whether this session will keep the device awake while it is running a voice
     * activity.  By default, the system holds a wake lock for it while in this state,
     * so that it can work even if the screen is off.  Setting this to false removes that
     * wake lock, allowing the CPU to go to sleep.  This is typically used if the
     * session decides it has been waiting too long for a response from the user and
     * doesn't want to let this continue to drain the battery.
     *
     * <p>Passing false here will release the wake lock, and you can call later with
     * true to re-acquire it.  It will also be automatically re-acquired for you each
     * time you start a new voice activity task -- that is when you call
     * {@link #startVoiceActivity}.</p>
