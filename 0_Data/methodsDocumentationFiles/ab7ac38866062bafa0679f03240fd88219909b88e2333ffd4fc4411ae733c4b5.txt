     * Call this to try to give focus to a specific view or to one of its
     * descendants.
     *
     * A view will not actually take focus if it is not focusable ({@link #isFocusable} returns
     * false), or if it can't be focused due to other conditions (not focusable in touch mode
     * ({@link #isFocusableInTouchMode}) while the device is in touch mode, not visible, not
     * enabled, or has no size).
     *
     * See also {@link #focusSearch(int)}, which is what you call to say that you
     * have focus, and you want your parent to look for the next one.
     *
     * This is equivalent to calling {@link #requestFocus(int, Rect)} with arguments
     * {@link #FOCUS_DOWN} and <code>null</code>.
     *
     * @return Whether this view or one of its descendants actually took focus.
