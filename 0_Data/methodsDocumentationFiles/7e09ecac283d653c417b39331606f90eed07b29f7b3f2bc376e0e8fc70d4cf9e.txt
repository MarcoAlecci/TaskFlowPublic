     * Instantiates an X509Certificate object, and initializes it with
     * the specified byte array.
     * The implementation (X509Certificate is an abstract class) is
     * provided by the class specified as the value of the
     * {@code cert.provider.x509v1} security property.
     *
     * <p>Note: All X509Certificate
     * subclasses must provide a constructor of the form:
     * <pre>{@code
     * public <subClass>(InputStream inStream) ...
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param certData a byte array containing the DER-encoded
     *        certificate.
     * @return an X509Certificate object initialized with the data
     *         from {@code certData}.
     * @exception CertificateException if a class initialization
     *            or certificate parsing error occurs.
