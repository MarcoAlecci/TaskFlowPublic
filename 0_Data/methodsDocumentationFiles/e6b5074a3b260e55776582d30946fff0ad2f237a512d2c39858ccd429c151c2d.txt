     * Get a list of supported high resolution sizes, which cannot operate at full BURST_CAPTURE
     * rate.
     *
     * <p>This includes all output sizes that cannot meet the 20 fps frame rate requirements for the
     * {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_BURST_CAPTURE BURST_CAPTURE}
     * capability.  This does not include the stall duration, so for example, a JPEG or RAW16 output
     * resolution with a large stall duration but a minimum frame duration that's above 20 fps will
     * still be listed in the regular {@link #getOutputSizes} list. All the sizes on this list that
     * are less than 24 megapixels are still guaranteed to operate at a rate of at least 10 fps,
     * not including stall duration. Sizes on this list that are at least 24 megapixels are allowed
     * to operate at less than 10 fps.</p>
     *
     * <p>For a device that does not support the BURST_CAPTURE capability, this list will be
     * {@code null}, since resolutions in the {@link #getOutputSizes} list are already not
     * guaranteed to meet &gt;= 20 fps rate requirements. For a device that does support the
     * BURST_CAPTURE capability, this list may be empty, if all supported resolutions meet the 20
     * fps requirement.</p>
     *
     * @return an array of supported slower high-resolution sizes, or {@code null} if the
     *         BURST_CAPTURE capability is not supported
