     * Set the default size of the image buffers.  The image producer may override the buffer size,
     * in which case the producer-set buffer size will be used, not the default size set by this
     * method.  Both video and camera based image producers do override the size.  This method may
     * be used to set the image size when producing images with {@link android.graphics.Canvas} (via
     * {@link android.view.Surface#lockCanvas}), or OpenGL ES (via an EGLSurface).
     * <p>
     * The new default buffer size will take effect the next time the image producer requests a
     * buffer to fill.  For {@link android.graphics.Canvas} this will be the next time {@link
     * android.view.Surface#lockCanvas} is called.  For OpenGL ES, the EGLSurface should be
     * destroyed (via eglDestroySurface), made not-current (via eglMakeCurrent), and then recreated
     * (via {@code eglCreateWindowSurface}) to ensure that the new default size has taken effect.
     * <p>
     * The width and height parameters must be no greater than the minimum of
     * {@code GL_MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS} and {@code GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE} (see
     * {@link javax.microedition.khronos.opengles.GL10#glGetIntegerv glGetIntegerv}).
     * An error due to invalid dimensions might not be reported until
     * updateTexImage() is called.
