     * Retrieve the raw TypedValue for the attribute at <var>index</var>
     * and return a temporary object holding its data.  This object is only
     * valid until the next call on to {@link TypedArray}.
     *
     * @param index Index of attribute to retrieve.
     *
     * @return Returns a TypedValue object if the attribute is defined,
     *         containing its data; otherwise returns null.  (You will not
     *         receive a TypedValue whose type is TYPE_NULL.)
     * @throws RuntimeException if the TypedArray has already been recycled.
