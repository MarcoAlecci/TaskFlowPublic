         * Called when the application requests to tune to a given channel for TV program recording.
         * Override this method in order to handle domain-specific features that are only known
         * between certain TV inputs and their clients.
         *
         * <p>The application may call this method before starting or after stopping recording, but
         * not during recording. The default implementation calls {@link #onTune(Uri)}.
         *
         * <p>The session must call {@link #notifyTuned(Uri)} if the tune request was fulfilled, or
         * {@link #notifyError(int)} otherwise.
         *
         * @param channelUri The URI of a channel.
         * @param params Domain-specific data for this tune request. Keys <em>must</em> be a scoped
         *            name, i.e. prefixed with a package name you own, so that different developers
         *            will not create conflicting keys.
