     * Called by the device owner or profile owner to clear application user data of a given
     * package. The behaviour of this is equivalent to the target application calling
     * {@link android.app.ActivityManager#clearApplicationUserData()}.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> an application can store data outside of its application data, e.g.
     * external storage or user dictionary. This data will not be wiped by calling this API.
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with.
     * @param packageName The name of the package which will have its user data wiped.
     * @param executor The executor through which the listener should be invoked.
     * @param listener A callback object that will inform the caller when the clearing is done.
     * @throws SecurityException if the caller is not the device owner/profile owner.
