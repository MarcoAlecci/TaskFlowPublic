     * Determines whether Nagle's algorithm is to be used. The Nagle's algorithm 
     * tries to conserve bandwidth by minimizing the number of segments that are 
     * sent. When applications wish to decrease network latency and increase 
     * performance, they can disable Nagle's algorithm (that is enable TCP_NODELAY). 
     * Data will be sent earlier, at the cost of an increase in bandwidth consumption. 
     *
     * @param value <tt>true</tt> if the Nagle's algorithm is to NOT be used
     *   (that is enable TCP_NODELAY), <tt>false</tt> otherwise.
