     * This method should only be used for files that you have direct access to;
     * if you'd like to work with media hosted outside your app, consider using

     * which enables remote providers to efficiently cache and invalidate
     * thumbnails.
     *
     * @param file The video file.
     * @param size The desired thumbnail size.
     * @throws IOException If any trouble was encountered while generating or
     *             loading the thumbnail, or if
     *             {@link CancellationSignal#cancel()} was invoked.
