         * Adds an application that's allowed to access the VPN connection.
         *
         * If this method is called at least once, only applications added through this method (and
         * no others) are allowed access. Else (if this method is never called), all applications
         * are allowed by default.  If some applications are added, other, un-added applications
         * will use networking as if the VPN wasn't running.
         *
         * A {@link Builder} may have only a set of allowed applications OR a set of disallowed
         * ones, but not both. Calling this method after {@link #addDisallowedApplication} has
         * already been called, or vice versa, will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
         *
         * {@code packageName} must be the canonical name of a currently installed application.
         * {@link PackageManager.NameNotFoundException} is thrown if there's no such application.
         *
         * @throws PackageManager.NameNotFoundException If the application isn't installed.
         *
         * @param packageName The full name (e.g.: "com.google.apps.contacts") of an application.
         *
         * @return this {@link Builder} object to facilitate chaining method calls.
