     * If the calling process of an IPC you are handling has not been
     * granted a particular permission, throw a {@link
     * SecurityException}.  This is basically the same as calling
     * {@link #enforcePermission(String, int, int, String)} with the
     * pid and uid returned by {@link android.os.Binder#getCallingPid}
     * and {@link android.os.Binder#getCallingUid}.  One important
     * difference is that if you are not currently processing an IPC,
     * this function will always throw the SecurityException.  This is
     * done to protect against accidentally leaking permissions; you
     * can use {@link #enforceCallingOrSelfPermission} to avoid this
     * protection.
     *
     * @param permission The name of the permission being checked.
     * @param message A message to include in the exception if it is thrown.
     *
     * @see #checkCallingPermission(String)
