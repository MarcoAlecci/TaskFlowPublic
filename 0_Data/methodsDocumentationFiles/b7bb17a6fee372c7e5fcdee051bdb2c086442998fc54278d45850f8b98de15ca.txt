     * Returns a new {@code BigDecimal} whose value is {@code this / divisor}.
     * The scale of the result is the difference of the scales of {@code this}
     * and {@code divisor}. If the exact result requires more digits, then the
     * scale is adjusted accordingly. For example, {@code 1/128 = 0.0078125}
     * which has a scale of {@code 7} and precision {@code 5}.
     *
     * @param divisor
     *            value by which {@code this} is divided.
     * @return {@code this / divisor}.
     * @throws NullPointerException
     *             if {@code divisor == null}.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if {@code divisor == 0}.
     * @throws ArithmeticException
     *             if the result cannot be represented exactly.
