     * Enable "emulator traces", in which information about the current
     * method is made available to the "emulator -trace" feature.  There
     * is no corresponding "disable" call -- this is intended for use by
     * the framework when tracing should be turned on and left that way, so
     * that traces captured with F9/F10 will include the necessary data.
     *
     * This puts the VM into "profile" mode, which has performance
     * consequences.
     *
     * To temporarily enable tracing, use {@link #startNativeTracing()}.
