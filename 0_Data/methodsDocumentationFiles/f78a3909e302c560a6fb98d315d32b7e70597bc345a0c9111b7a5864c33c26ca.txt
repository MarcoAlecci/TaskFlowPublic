     * {@link SmsManager} instance has been created with {@link #getDefault()}, and no user-defined
     * default subscription is defined, the subscription ID associated with this message will be
     * INVALID, which will result in the operation being completed on the subscription associated
     * with logical slot 0. Use {@link #getSmsManagerForSubscriptionId(int)} to ensure the
     * operation is performed on the correct subscription.
