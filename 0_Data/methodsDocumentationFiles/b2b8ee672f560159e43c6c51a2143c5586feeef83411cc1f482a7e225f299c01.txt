     * request are passed in a Bundle that contains several pieces of data depending on the
     * chosen request type.
     *
     * @param requestType The type of request. The type could be one of the
     * predefined types specified here or a custom type that the specific
     * Restrictions Provider might understand. For custom types, the type name should be
     * namespaced to avoid collisions with predefined types and types specified by
     * other Restrictions Providers.
     * @param requestId A unique id generated by the app that contains sufficient information
     * to identify the parameters of the request when it receives the id in the response.
     * @param request A PersistableBundle containing the data corresponding to the specified request
     * type. The keys for the data in the bundle depend on the request type.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any of the required parameters are missing.
