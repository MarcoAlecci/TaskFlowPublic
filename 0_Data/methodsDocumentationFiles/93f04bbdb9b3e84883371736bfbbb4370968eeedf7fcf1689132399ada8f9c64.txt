     * Performs a logical <b>AND</b> of this target bit set with the
     * argument bit set. This bit set is modified so that each bit in it
     * has the value {@code true} if and only if it both initially
     * had the value {@code true} and the corresponding bit in the
     * bit set argument also had the value {@code true}.
