     * Return whether the calling user is running in an "unlocked" state.
     * <p>
     * On devices with direct boot, a user is unlocked only after they've
     * entered their credentials (such as a lock pattern or PIN). On devices
     * without direct boot, a user is unlocked as soon as it starts.
     * <p>
     * When a user is locked, only device-protected data storage is available.
     * When a user is unlocked, both device-protected and credential-protected
     * private app data storage is available.
