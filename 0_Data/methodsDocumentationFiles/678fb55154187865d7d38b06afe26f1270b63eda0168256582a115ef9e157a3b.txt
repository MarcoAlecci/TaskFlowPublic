     * Report an accessibility action to this view's parents for delegated processing.
     *
     * <p>Implementations of {@link #performAccessibilityAction(int, Bundle)} may internally
     * call this method to delegate an accessibility action to a supporting parent. If the parent
     * returns true from its
     * {@link ViewParent#onNestedPrePerformAccessibilityAction(View, int, android.os.Bundle)}
     * method this method will return true to signify that the action was consumed.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method is useful for implementing nested scrolling child views. If
     * {@link #isNestedScrollingEnabled()} returns true and the action is a scrolling action
     * a custom view implementation may invoke this method to allow a parent to consume the
     * scroll first. If this method returns true the custom view should skip its own scrolling
     * behavior.</p>

     * @param action Accessibility action to delegate

     * @return true if the action was consumed by a parent
