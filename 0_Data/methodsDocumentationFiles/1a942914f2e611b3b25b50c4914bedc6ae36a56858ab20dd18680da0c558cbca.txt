     * Test whether that address is reachable. Best effort is made by the
     * implementation to try to reach the host, but firewalls and server
     * configuration may block requests resulting in a unreachable status
     * while some specific ports may be accessible.
     * <p>
     * Android implementation attempts ICMP ECHO REQUESTs first, on failure it
     * will fall back to TCP ECHO REQUESTs. Success on either protocol will
     * return true.
     * <p>
     * The timeout value, in milliseconds, indicates the maximum amount of time
     * the try should take. If the operation times out before getting an
     * answer, the host is deemed unreachable. A negative value will result
     * in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown.
     *
     * @param   timeout the time, in milliseconds, before the call aborts
     * @return a {@code boolean} indicating if the address is reachable.
     * @throws IOException if a network error occurs
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException if {@code timeout} is negative.
