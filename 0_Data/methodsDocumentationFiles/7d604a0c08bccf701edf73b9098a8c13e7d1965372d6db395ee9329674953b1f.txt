     * Temporarily whitelist the specified app for a short duration. This is to allow an app
     * receiving a high priority message to be able to access the network and acquire wakelocks
     * even if the device is in power-save mode or the app is currently considered inactive.
     * @param packageName The package name of the app to whitelist.
     * @param duration Duration to whitelist the app for, in milliseconds. It is recommended that
     * this be limited to 10s of seconds. Requested duration will be clamped to a few minutes.
     * @param user The user for whom the package should be whitelisted. Passing in a user that is
     * not the same as the caller's process will require the INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS permission.
     * @see #isAppInactive(String)

     * @deprecated Use
     * {@link android.os.PowerWhitelistManager#whitelistAppTemporarily(String, long)} instead.
