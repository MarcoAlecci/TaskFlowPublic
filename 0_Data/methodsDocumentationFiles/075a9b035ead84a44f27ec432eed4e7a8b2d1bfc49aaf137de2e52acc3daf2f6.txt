     * Silences the ringer if a ringing call exists.
     * <p>
     * This method can only be relied upon to stop the ringtone for a call if the ringtone has
     * already started playing.  It is intended to handle use-cases such as silencing a ringing call
     * when the user presses the volume button during ringing.
     * <p>
     * If this method is called prior to when the ringtone begins playing, the ringtone will not be
     * silenced.  As such it is not intended as a means to avoid playing of a ringtone.
     * <p>
     * A dialer app which wants to have more control over ringtone playing should declare
     * {@link TelecomManager#METADATA_IN_CALL_SERVICE_RINGING} in the manifest entry for their
     * {@link InCallService} implementation to indicate that the app wants to be responsible for
     * playing the ringtone for all incoming calls.
     * <p>
     * Requires permission: {@link android.Manifest.permission#MODIFY_PHONE_STATE} or that the
     * app fills the dialer role (see {@link #getDefaultDialerPackage()}).
