     * Releases resources associated with the current session of
     * MediaDrm. It is considered good practice to call this method when
     * the {@link MediaDrm} object is no longer needed in your
     * application. After this method is called, {@link MediaDrm} is no
     * longer usable since it has lost all of its required resource.
     *
     * This method was added in API 28. In API versions 18 through 27, release()
     * should be called instead. There is no need to do anything for API
     * versions prior to 18.
