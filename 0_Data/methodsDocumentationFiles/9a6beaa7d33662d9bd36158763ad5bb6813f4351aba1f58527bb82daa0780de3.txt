     * Temporarily end the transaction to let other threads run. The transaction is assumed to be
     * successful so far. Do not call setTransactionSuccessful before calling this. When this
     * returns a new transaction will have been created but not marked as successful.
     * @return true if the transaction was yielded
     * @deprecated if the db is locked more than once (because of nested transactions) then the lock
     *   will not be yielded. Use yieldIfContendedSafely instead.
