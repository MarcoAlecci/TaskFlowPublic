     * Gets the accumulated delta range since the last channel reset, in meters.
     *
     * <p>The error estimate for this value is {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeUncertaintyMeters()}.
     *
     * <p>The availability of the value is represented by {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeState()}.
     *
     * <p>A positive value indicates that the SV is moving away from the receiver.
     * The sign of {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeMeters()} and its relation to the sign of
     * {@link #getCarrierPhase()} is given by the equation:
     *
     * <pre>
     *          accumulated delta range = -k * carrier phase    (where k is a constant)</pre>
     *
     * <p>Similar to the concept of an RTCM "Phaserange", when the accumulated delta range is
     * initially chosen, and whenever it is reset, it will retain the integer nature
     * of the relative carrier phase offset between satellites observed by this receiver, such that
     * the double difference of this value between receivers and satellites may be used, together
     * with integer ambiguity resolution, to determine highly precise relative location between
     * receivers.
     *
     * <p>This includes ensuring that all half-cycle ambiguities are resolved before this value is
     * reported as {@link #ADR_STATE_VALID}.
     *
     * <p>The alignment of the phase measurement will not be adjusted by the receiver so the
     * in-phase and quadrature phase components will have a quarter cycle offset as they do when
     * transmitted from the satellites. If the measurement is from a combination of the in-phase
     * and quadrature phase components, then the alignment of the phase measurement will be aligned
     * to the in-phase component.
