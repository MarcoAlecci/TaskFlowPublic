     * Converts a complex data value holding a fraction to its final floating 
     * point value. The given <var>data</var> must be structured as a 
     * {@link #TYPE_FRACTION}.
     * 
     * @param data A complex data value holding a unit, magnitude, and 
     *             mantissa.
     * @param base The base value of this fraction.  In other words, a 
     *             standard fraction is multiplied by this value.
     * @param pbase The parent base value of this fraction.  In other 
     *             words, a parent fraction (nn%p) is multiplied by this
     *             value.
     * 
     * @return The complex floating point value multiplied by the appropriate 
     * base value depending on its unit.
