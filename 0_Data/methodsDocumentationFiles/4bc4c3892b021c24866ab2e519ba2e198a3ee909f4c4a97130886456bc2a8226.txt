     * Make a tag read-only.
     *
     * <p>This sets the CC field to indicate the tag is read-only,
     * and where possible permanently sets the lock bits to prevent
     * any further modification of the memory.
     * <p>This is a one-way process and cannot be reverted!
     *
     * <p>This is an I/O operation and will block until complete. It must
     * not be called from the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
     * {@link IOException} if {@link #close} is called from another thread.
     *
     * <p class="note">Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#NFC} permission.
     *
     * @return true on success, false if it is not possible to make this tag read-only
     * @throws TagLostException if the tag leaves the field
     * @throws IOException if there is an I/O failure, or the operation is canceled
