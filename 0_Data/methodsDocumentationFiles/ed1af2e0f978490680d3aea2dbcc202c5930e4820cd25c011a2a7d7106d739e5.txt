     * Add a named logger.  This does nothing and returns false if a logger
     * with the same name is already registered.
     * <p>
     * The Logger factory methods call this method to register each
     * newly created Logger.
     * <p>
     * The application should retain its own reference to the Logger
     * object to avoid it being garbage collected.  The LogManager
     * may only retain a weak reference.
     *
     * @param   logger the new logger.
     * @return  true if the argument logger was registered successfully,
     *          false if a logger of that name already exists.
     * @exception NullPointerException if the logger name is null.
