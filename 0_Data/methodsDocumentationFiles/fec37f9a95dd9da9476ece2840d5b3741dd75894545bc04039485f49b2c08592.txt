         * Allow any app on the device to access this blob data once it is committed using
         * a {@link BlobHandle} representing the blob.
         *
         * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is only meant to be used from libraries and SDKs where
         * the apps which we want to allow access is not known ahead of time.
         * If a blob is being committed to be shared with a particular set of apps, it is highly
         * recommended to use {@link #allowPackageAccess(String, byte[])} instead.
         *
         * <p> This needs to be called before committing the blob using
         * {@link #commit(Executor, Consumer)}.
         *
         * @throws IOException when there is an I/O error while changing the access.
         * @throws SecurityException when the caller is not the owner of the session.
         * @throws IllegalStateException when the caller tries to change access for a blob which is
         *                               already committed.
