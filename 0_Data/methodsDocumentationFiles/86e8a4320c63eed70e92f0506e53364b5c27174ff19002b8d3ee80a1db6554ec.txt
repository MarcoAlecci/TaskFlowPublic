     * Generates a recoverable key with the given {@code alias} and {@code metadata}.
     *
     * <p>The metadata should contain any data that needs to be cryptographically bound to the
     * generated key, but does not need to be encrypted by the key. For example, the metadata can
     * be a byte string describing the algorithms and non-secret parameters to be used with the
     * key. The supplied metadata can later be obtained via
     * {@link WrappedApplicationKey#getMetadata()}.
     *
     * <p>During the key recovery process, the same metadata has to be supplied via
     * {@link WrappedApplicationKey.Builder#setMetadata(byte[])}; otherwise, the recovery process
     * will fail due to the checking of the cryptographic binding. This can help prevent
     * potential attacks that try to swap key materials on the backup server and trick the
     * application to use keys with different algorithms or parameters.
     *
     * @throws InternalRecoveryServiceException if an unexpected error occurred in the recovery
     *     service.
     * @throws LockScreenRequiredException if the user does not have a lock screen set. A lock
     *     screen is required to generate recoverable keys.
