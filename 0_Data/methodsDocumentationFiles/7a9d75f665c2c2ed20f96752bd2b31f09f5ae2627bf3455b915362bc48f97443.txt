     * Returns true if this view is focusable or if it contains a reachable View
     * for which {@link #hasFocusable()} returns {@code true}. A "reachable hasFocusable()"
     * is a view whose parents do not block descendants focus.
     * Only {@link #VISIBLE} views are considered focusable.
     *
     * <p>As of {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#O} views that are determined to be focusable
     * through {@link #FOCUSABLE_AUTO} will also cause this method to return {@code true}.
     * Apps that declare a {@link android.content.pm.ApplicationInfo#targetSdkVersion} of
     * earlier than {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#O} will continue to see this method return
     * {@code false} for views not explicitly marked as focusable.
     * Use {@link #hasExplicitFocusable()} if you require the pre-{@link Build.VERSION_CODES#O}
     * behavior.</p>
