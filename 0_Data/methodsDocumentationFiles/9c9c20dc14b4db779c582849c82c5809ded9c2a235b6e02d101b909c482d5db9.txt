     * Factory method to create a new {@code SpeechRecognizer}. Please note that
     * {@link #setRecognitionListener(RecognitionListener)} should be called before dispatching any
     * command to the created {@code SpeechRecognizer}, otherwise no notifications will be
     * received.
     *
     * Use this version of the method to specify a specific service to direct this
     * {@link SpeechRecognizer} to. Normally you would not use this; use
     * {@link #createSpeechRecognizer(Context)} instead to use the system default recognition
     * service.
     * 
     * @param context in which to create {@code SpeechRecognizer}
     * @param serviceComponent the {@link ComponentName} of a specific service to direct this
