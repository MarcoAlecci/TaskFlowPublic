     * Explicitly limits augmented autofill to the given packages and activities.
     *
     * <p>To reset the whitelist, call it passing {@code null} to both arguments.
     *
     * <p>Useful when the service wants to restrict augmented autofill to a category of apps, like
     * apps that uses addresses. For example, if the service wants to support augmented autofill on
     * all activities of app {@code AddressApp1} and just activities {@code act1} and {@code act2}
     * of {@code AddressApp2}, it would call:
     * {@code setAugmentedAutofillWhitelist(Arrays.asList("AddressApp1"),
     * Arrays.asList(new ComponentName("AddressApp2", "act1"),
     * new ComponentName("AddressApp2", "act2")));}
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> This method should only be called by the app providing the augmented autofill
     * service, and it's ignored if the caller isn't it.
