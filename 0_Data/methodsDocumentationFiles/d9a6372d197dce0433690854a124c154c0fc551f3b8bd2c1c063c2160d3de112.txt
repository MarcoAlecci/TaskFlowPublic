     * Switch to a new input method subtype of the current input method.
     * @param subtype A new input method subtype to switch.
     * @return true if the current subtype was successfully switched. When the specified subtype is
     * null, this method returns false.
     * @deprecated If the calling process is an IME, use
     *             {@link InputMethodService#switchInputMethod(String, InputMethodSubtype)}, which
     *             does not require any permission as long as the caller is the current IME.
     *             If the calling process is some privileged app that already has
     *             {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS} permission, just
     *             directly update {@link Settings.Secure#SELECTED_INPUT_METHOD_SUBTYPE}.
