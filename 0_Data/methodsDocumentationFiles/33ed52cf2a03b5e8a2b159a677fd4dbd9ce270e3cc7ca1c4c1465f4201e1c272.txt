     * Updates the {@link Paint} object used with the current layer (used only if the current
     * layer type is not set to {@link #LAYER_TYPE_NONE}). Changed properties of the Paint
     * provided to {@link #setLayerType(int, android.graphics.Paint)} will be used the next time
     * the View is redrawn, but {@link #setLayerPaint(android.graphics.Paint)} must be called to
     * ensure that the view gets redrawn immediately.
     *
     * <p>A layer is associated with an optional {@link android.graphics.Paint}
     * instance that controls how the layer is composed on screen. The following
     * properties of the paint are taken into account when composing the layer:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link android.graphics.Paint#getAlpha() Translucency (alpha)}</li>
     * <li>{@link android.graphics.Paint#getXfermode() Blending mode}</li>
     * <li>{@link android.graphics.Paint#getColorFilter() Color filter}</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If this view has an alpha value set to < 1.0 by calling {@link #setAlpha(float)}, the
     * alpha value of the layer's paint is superseded by this view's alpha value.</p>
     *
     * @param paint The paint used to compose the layer. This argument is optional
     *        and can be null. It is ignored when the layer type is
     *        {@link #LAYER_TYPE_NONE}
     *
