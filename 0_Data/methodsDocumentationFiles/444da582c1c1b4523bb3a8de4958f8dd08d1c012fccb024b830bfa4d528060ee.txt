     * Called when there has been a failure transferring the {@link AssistStructure} to
     * the assistant.  This may happen, for example, if the data is too large and results
     * in an out of memory exception, or the client has provided corrupt data.  This will
     * be called immediately before {@link #onHandleAssist} and the AssistStructure supplied
     * there afterwards will be null.
     *
     * @param failure The failure exception that was thrown when building the
     * {@link AssistStructure}.
