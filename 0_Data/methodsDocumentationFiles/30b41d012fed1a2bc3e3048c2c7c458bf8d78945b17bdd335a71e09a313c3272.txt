     * <p>Compute the vertical range that the vertical scrollbar represents.</p>
     *
     * <p>The range is expressed in arbitrary units that must be the same as the units used by
     * {@link #computeVerticalScrollExtent()} and {@link #computeVerticalScrollOffset()}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Default implementation returns 0.</p>
     *
     * <p>If you want to support scroll bars, override
     * {@link RecyclerView.LayoutManager#computeVerticalScrollRange(RecyclerView.State)} in your
     * LayoutManager.</p>
     *
     * @return The total vertical range represented by the vertical scrollbar
     * @see RecyclerView.LayoutManager#computeVerticalScrollRange(RecyclerView.State)
