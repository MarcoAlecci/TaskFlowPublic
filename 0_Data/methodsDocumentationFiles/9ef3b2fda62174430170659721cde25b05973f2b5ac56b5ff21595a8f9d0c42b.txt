     * Continues a multi-part update of the Additional Authentication
     * Data (AAD), using a subset of the provided buffer.
     * <p>
     * Calls to this method provide AAD to the cipher when operating in
     * modes such as AEAD (GCM/CCM).  If this cipher is operating in
     * either GCM or CCM mode, all AAD must be supplied before beginning
     * operations on the ciphertext (via the {@code update} and {@code
     * doFinal} methods).
     *
     * @param src the buffer containing the AAD
     * @param offset the offset in {@code src} where the AAD input starts
     * @param len the number of AAD bytes
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the {@code src}
     * byte array is null, or the {@code offset} or {@code length}
     * is less than 0, or the sum of the {@code offset} and
     * {@code len} is greater than the length of the
     * {@code src} byte array
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this cipher is in a wrong state
     * (e.g., has not been initialized), does not accept AAD, or if
     * operating in either GCM or CCM mode and one of the {@code update}
     * methods has already been called for the active
     * encryption/decryption operation
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the corresponding method
     * in the {@code CipherSpi} has not been overridden by an
     * implementation
