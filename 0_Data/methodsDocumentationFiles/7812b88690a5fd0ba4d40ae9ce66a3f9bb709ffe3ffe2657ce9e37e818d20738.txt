     * When enabled, verify that all projections and {@link ContentValues} only
     * contain valid columns as defined by {@link #setProjectionMap(Map)}.
     * <p>
     * This enforcement applies to {@link #insert}, {@link #query}, and
     * {@link #update} operations. Any enforcement failures will throw an
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
     * <p>
     * This feature is disabled by default on each newly constructed
     * {@link SQLiteQueryBuilder} and needs to be manually enabled.
