     * Add a quadratic bezier from the last point, approaching control point
     * (x1,y1), and ending at (x2,y2). If no moveTo() call has been made for
     * this contour, the first point is automatically set to (0,0).
     *
     * @param x1 The x-coordinate of the control point on a quadratic curve
     * @param y1 The y-coordinate of the control point on a quadratic curve
     * @param x2 The x-coordinate of the end point on a quadratic curve
     * @param y2 The y-coordinate of the end point on a quadratic curve
