     * Starts dragging the provided ViewHolder. By default, ItemTouchHelper starts a drag when a
     * View is long pressed. You can disable that behavior by overriding
     * {@link ItemTouchHelper.Callback#isLongPressDragEnabled()}.
     * <p>
     * For this method to work:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The provided ViewHolder must be a child of the RecyclerView to which this
     * ItemTouchHelper
     * is attached.</li>
     * <li>{@link ItemTouchHelper.Callback} must have dragging enabled.</li>
     * <li>There must be a previous touch event that was reported to the ItemTouchHelper
     * through RecyclerView's ItemTouchListener mechanism. As long as no other ItemTouchListener
     * grabs previous events, this should work as expected.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * For example, if you would like to let your user to be able to drag an Item by touching one
     * of its descendants, you may implement it as follows:
     * <pre>
     *     viewHolder.dragButton.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
     *         public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
     *             if (MotionEvent.getActionMasked(event) == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
     *                 mItemTouchHelper.startDrag(viewHolder);
     *             }
     *             return false;
     *         }
     *     });
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     *
     * @param viewHolder The ViewHolder to start dragging. It must be a direct child of
     *                   RecyclerView.
     * @see ItemTouchHelper.Callback#isItemViewSwipeEnabled()
