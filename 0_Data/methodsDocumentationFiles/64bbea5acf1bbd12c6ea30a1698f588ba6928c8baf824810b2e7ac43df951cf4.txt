     * Open the given {@link File} and returns a {@link ParcelFileDescriptor}
     * that offers a redacted view of the underlying data. If a redacted region
     * is written to, the newly written data can be read back correctly instead
     * of continuing to be redacted.
     *
     * @param file The underlying file to open.
     * @param mode The {@link ParcelFileDescriptor} mode to open with.
     * @param redactRanges List of file ranges that should be redacted, stored
     *            as {@code [start1, end1, start2, end2, ...]}. Start values are
     *            inclusive and end values are exclusive.
     * @param freePositions List of file offsets at which the four byte value 'free' should be
     *            written instead of zeros within parts of the file covered by {@code redactRanges}.
     *            Non-redacted bytes will not be modified even if covered by a 'free'. This is
     *            useful for overwriting boxes in ISOBMFF files with padding data.
