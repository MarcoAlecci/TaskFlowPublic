     * Rename an existing document.
     * <p>
     * If a different {@link Document#COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID} must be used to
     * represent the renamed document, generate and return it. Any outstanding
     * URI permission grants will be updated to point at the new document. If
     * the original {@link Document#COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID} is still valid after the
     * rename, return {@code null}.
     *
     * @param documentId the document to rename.
     * @param displayName the updated display name of the document. The provider
     *            may alter this name to meet any internal constraints, such as
     *            avoiding conflicting names.
     * @throws AuthenticationRequiredException If authentication is required from
     *            the user (such as login credentials), but it is not guaranteed
     *            that the client will handle this properly.
