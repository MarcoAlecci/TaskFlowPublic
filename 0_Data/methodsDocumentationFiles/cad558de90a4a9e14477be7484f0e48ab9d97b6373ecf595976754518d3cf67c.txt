     * Retrieve the banner associated with an Intent. If intent.getClassName()
     * is set, this simply returns the result of
     * getActivityBanner(intent.getClassName()). Otherwise it resolves the
     * intent's component and returns the banner associated with the resolved
     * component. If intent.getClassName() cannot be found or the Intent cannot
     * be resolved to a component, NameNotFoundException is thrown.
     *
     * @param intent The intent for which you would like to retrieve a banner.
     * @return Returns the image of the banner, or null if the activity has no
     *         banner specified.
     * @throws NameNotFoundException Thrown if the resources for application
     *             matching the given intent could not be loaded.
     * @see #getActivityBanner(ComponentName)
