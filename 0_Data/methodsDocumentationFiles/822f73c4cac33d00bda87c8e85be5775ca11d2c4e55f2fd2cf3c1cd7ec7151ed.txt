         * Scroll vertically by dy pixels in screen coordinates and return the distance traveled.
         * The default implementation does nothing and returns 0.

         * @param dy            distance to scroll in pixels. Y increases as scroll position
         *                      approaches the bottom.
         * @param recycler      Recycler to use for fetching potentially cached views for a

         * @param state         Transient state of RecyclerView
         * @return The actual distance scrolled. The return value will be negative if dy was
         * negative and scrolling proceeeded in that direction.
         * <code>Math.abs(result)</code> may be less than dy if a boundary was reached.
