     * The audio parameter is a copy of what will be synthesized to the speakers (when synthesis was
     * initiated with a {@link TextToSpeech#speak} call) or written to the file system (for
     * {@link TextToSpeech#synthesizeToFile}). The audio bytes are delivered in one or more chunks;
     * if {@link #onDone} or {@link #onError} is called all chunks have been received.
     * </p>

     * <p>
     * The audio received here may not be played for some time depending on buffer sizes and the
     * amount of items on the synthesis queue.

     * @param utteranceId The utterance ID of the utterance.
