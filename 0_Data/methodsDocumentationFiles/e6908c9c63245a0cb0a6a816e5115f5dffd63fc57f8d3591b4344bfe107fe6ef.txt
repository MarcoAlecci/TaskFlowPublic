     * transition propagation monitors. These values are then passed as the startValues
     * or endValues structure in a later call to
     * {@link #getStartDelay(ViewGroup, Transition, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}.
     * The main concern for an implementation is what the
     * properties are that the transition cares about and what the values are
     * for all of those properties. The start and end values will be compared
     * later during the

     * @param transitionValues The holder for any values that the Transition
     * wishes to store. Values are stored in the <code>values</code> field
     * of this TransitionValues object and are keyed from
     * a String value. For example, to store a view's rotation value,
     * a transition might call
     * <code>transitionValues.values.put("appname:transitionname:rotation",
     * view.getRotation())</code>. The target view will already be stored in
     * the transitionValues structure when this method is called.
