     * For jobs with {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#addTriggerContentUri} set, this
     * reports which content authorities have triggered the job.  It will only be null if no
     * authorities have triggered it -- that is, the job executed for some other reason, such
     * as a deadline expiring.  If this is non-null, you can use {@link #getTriggeredContentUris()}
     * to retrieve the details of which URIs changed (as long as that has not exceeded the maximum
     * number it can reported).
