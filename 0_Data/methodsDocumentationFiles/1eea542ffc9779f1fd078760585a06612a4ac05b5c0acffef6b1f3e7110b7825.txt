         * <p>This is a mandatory field when publishing a new shortcut with
         * {@link ShortcutManager#addDynamicShortcuts(List)} or
         * {@link ShortcutManager#setDynamicShortcuts(List)}.
         *
         * <p>A shortcut can launch any intent that the publisher app has permission to
         * launch.  For example, a shortcut can launch an unexported activity within the publisher
         * app.  A shortcut intent doesn't have to point at the target activity.
         *
         * <p>The given {@code intent} can contain extras, but these extras must contain values
         * of primitive types in order for the system to persist these values.
