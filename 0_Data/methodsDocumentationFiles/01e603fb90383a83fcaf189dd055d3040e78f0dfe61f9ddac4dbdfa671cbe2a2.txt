     * <p>Standard APDUs have a 1-byte length field, allowing a maximum of
     * 255 payload bytes, which results in a maximum APDU length of 261 bytes.
     *
     * <p>Extended length APDUs have a 3-byte length field, allowing 65535
     * payload bytes.
     *
     * <p>Some NFC adapters, like the one used in the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus
     * do not support extended length APDUs. They are expected to be well-supported
     * in the future though. Use this method to check for extended length APDU
     * support.
     *
     * @return whether the NFC adapter on this device supports extended length APDUs.
