     * Launch multiple new activities.  This is generally the same as calling
     * {@link #startActivity(Intent)} for the first Intent in the array,
     * that activity during its creation calling {@link #startActivity(Intent)}
     * for the second entry, etc.  Note that unlike that approach, generally
     * none of the activities except the last in the array will be created
     * at this point, but rather will be created when the user first visits
     * them (due to pressing back from the activity on top).
     *
     * <p>This method throws {@link ActivityNotFoundException}
     * if there was no Activity found for <em>any</em> given Intent.  In this
     * case the state of the activity stack is undefined (some Intents in the
     * list may be on it, some not), so you probably want to avoid such situations.
     *
     * @param intents An array of Intents to be started.
     * @param options Additional options for how the Activity should be started.
     * @param userHandle The user for whom to launch the activities
     * See {@link android.content.Context#startActivity(Intent, Bundle)}
     * Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.
     *
     * @return The corresponding flag {@link ActivityManager#START_CANCELED},
     *         {@link ActivityManager#START_SUCCESS} etc. indicating whether the launch was
     *         successful.
