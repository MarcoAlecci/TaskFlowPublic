         * card can be used, or if some other action must be taken before using the card. For
         * example, an NFC-enabled card could be labeled "Hold near reader" to inform the user of
         * how to use NFC cards when interacting with an NFC reader. This field is optional.
         * <b>Note: </b> this card label should <b>not</b> contain PII (Personally Identifiable

         * on one line, it may be truncated and ellipsized.
