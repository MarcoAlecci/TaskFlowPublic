         * Create a UID predicate from a string representing a list of UID ranges
         *
         * <p>UID ranges are a pair of integers separated by a '-'. If you want to specify a single
         * UID (e.g. UID 1000), you can use {@code 1000-1000}. Lists of ranges are separated by a
         * single ';'. For example, this would be a valid string representation: {@code
         * "1000-1999;2003-2003;2004-2004;2050-2060"}.
         *
         * <p>We do not use ',' to delimit as it is already used in separating different setting
         * arguments.
         *
         * @throws NumberFormatException if the input string is incorrectly formatted
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if an UID range has a lower end than start
