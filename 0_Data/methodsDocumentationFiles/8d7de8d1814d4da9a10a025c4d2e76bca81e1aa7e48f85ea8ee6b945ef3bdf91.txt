     * Continues a multiple-part encryption or decryption operation
     * (depending on how this cipher was initialized), processing another data
     * part.
     *
     * <p>The first <code>inputLen</code> bytes in the <code>input</code>
     * buffer, starting at <code>inputOffset</code> inclusive, are processed,
     * and the result is stored in a new buffer.
     *
     * <p>If <code>inputLen</code> is zero, this method returns
     * <code>null</code>.
     *
     * @param input the input buffer
     * @param inputOffset the offset in <code>input</code> where the input
     * starts
     * @param inputLen the input length
     *
     * @return the new buffer with the result, or null if the underlying
     * cipher is a block cipher and the input data is too short to result in a
     * new block.
     *
     * @exception IllegalStateException if this cipher is in a wrong state
     * (e.g., has not been initialized)
