     * Gets the stride of the Allocation.
     * For a 2D or 3D Allocation, the raw data maybe padded so that each row of
     * the Allocation has certain alignment. The size of each row including such
     * padding is called stride.
     *
     * @return the stride. For 1D Allocation, the stride will be the number of
     *         bytes of this Allocation. For 2D and 3D Allocations, the stride
     *         will be the stride in X dimension measuring in bytes.
