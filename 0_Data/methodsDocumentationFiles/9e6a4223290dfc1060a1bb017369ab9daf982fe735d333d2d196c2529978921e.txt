         * <p>Note that enabling this feature requires that the secure lock screen (e.g., password,
         * PIN, pattern) is set up, otherwise setting the {@code KeyStore} entry will fail.
         * Moreover, this entry will be deleted when the secure lock screen is disabled or reset
         * (e.g., by the user or a Device Administrator). Finally, this entry cannot be used until
         * the user unlocks the secure lock screen after boot.
