     * Sets the playback parameters.
     * This method returns failure if it cannot apply the playback parameters.
     * One possible cause is that the parameters for speed or pitch are out of range.
     * Another possible cause is that the <code>AudioTrack</code> is streaming
     * (see {@link #MODE_STREAM}) and the
     * buffer size is too small. For speeds greater than 1.0f, the <code>AudioTrack</code> buffer
     * on configuration must be larger than the speed multiplied by the minimum size
     * {@link #getMinBufferSize(int, int, int)}) to allow proper playback.
     * @param params see {@link PlaybackParams}. In particular,
     * speed, pitch, and audio mode should be set.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the parameters are invalid or not accepted.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if track is not initialized.
