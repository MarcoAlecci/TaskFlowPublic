     * Rebinds the media router to handle routes that belong to the specified user.
     * Requires the interact across users permission to access the routes of another user.
     * <p>
     * This method is a complete hack to work around the singleton nature of the
     * media router when running inside of singleton processes like QuickSettings.
     * This mechanism should be burned to the ground when MediaRouter is redesigned.
     * Ideally the current user would be pulled from the Context but we need to break
     * down MediaRouter.Static before we can get there.
