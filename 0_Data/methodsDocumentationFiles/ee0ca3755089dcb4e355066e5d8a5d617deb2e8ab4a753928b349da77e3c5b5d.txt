     * Returns the size of the allocated memory used to store this bitmap's pixels.
     *
     * <p>This can be larger than the result of {@link #getByteCount()} if a bitmap is reused to
     * decode other bitmaps of smaller size, or by manual reconfiguration. See {@link
     * #reconfigure(int, int, Config)}, {@link #setWidth(int)}, {@link #setHeight(int)}, {@link
     * #setConfig(Bitmap.Config)}, and {@link BitmapFactory.Options#inBitmap
     * BitmapFactory.Options.inBitmap}. If a bitmap is not modified in this way, this value will be
     * the same as that returned by {@link #getByteCount()}.</p>
     *
     * <p>This value will not change over the lifetime of a Bitmap.</p>
