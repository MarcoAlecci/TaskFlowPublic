     * Given a Drawable whose bounds have been set to draw into this view,
     * update a Region being computed for
     * {@link #gatherTransparentRegion(android.graphics.Region)} so
     * that any non-transparent parts of the Drawable are removed from the
     * given transparent region.
     *
     * @param dr The Drawable whose transparency is to be applied to the region.
     * @param region A Region holding the current transparency information,
     * where any parts of the region that are set are considered to be
     * transparent.  On return, this region will be modified to have the
     * transparency information reduced by the corresponding parts of the
     * Drawable that are not transparent.
