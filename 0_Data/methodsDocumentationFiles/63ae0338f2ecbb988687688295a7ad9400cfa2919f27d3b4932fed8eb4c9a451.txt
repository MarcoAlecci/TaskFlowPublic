     * Configures the delay and padding values for the current compressed stream playing
     * in offload mode.
     * This can only be used on a track successfully initialized with
     * {@link AudioTrack.Builder#setOffloadedPlayback(boolean)}. The unit is frames, where a
     * frame indicates the number of samples per channel, e.g. 100 frames for a stereo compressed
     * stream corresponds to 200 decoded interleaved PCM samples.
     * @param delayInFrames number of frames to be ignored at the beginning of the stream. A value
     *     of 0 indicates no delay is to be applied.
     * @param paddingInFrames number of frames to be ignored at the end of the stream. A value of 0
     *     of 0 indicates no padding is to be applied.
