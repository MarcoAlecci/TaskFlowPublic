     * Prepare to apply an unattended update by asking the user for their Lock Screen Knowledge
     * Factor (LSKF). If supplied, the {@code intentSender} will be called when the system is setup
     * and ready to apply the OTA.
     * <p>
     * When the system is already prepared for update and this API is called again with the same
     * {@code updateToken}, it will not call the intent sender nor request the user enter their Lock
     * Screen Knowledge Factor.
     * <p>
     * When this API is called again with a different {@code updateToken}, the prepared-for-update
     * status is reset and process repeats as though it's the initial call to this method as
     * described in the first paragraph.
     *
     * @param context the Context to use.
     * @param updateToken token used to indicate which update was prepared
     * @param intentSender the intent to call when the update is prepared; may be {@code null}
     * @throws IOException if there were any errors setting up unattended update
