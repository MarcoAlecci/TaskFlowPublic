     * If you want the animation to play immediately, use
     * {@link #startAnimation(android.view.animation.Animation)} instead.
     * This method provides allows fine-grained
     * control over the start time and invalidation, but you
     * must make sure that 1) the animation has a start time set, and
     * 2) the view's parent (which controls animations on its children)
     * will be invalidated when the animation is supposed to
     * start.

     * @param animation The next animation, or null.
