     * Returns the configured audio source sample rate in Hz.
     * The initial source sample rate depends on the constructor parameters,
     * but the source sample rate may change if {@link #setPlaybackRate(int)} is called.
     * If the constructor had a specific sample rate, then the initial sink sample rate is that
     * value.
     * If the constructor had {@link AudioFormat#SAMPLE_RATE_UNSPECIFIED},
     * then the initial sink sample rate is a route-dependent default value based on the source [sic].
