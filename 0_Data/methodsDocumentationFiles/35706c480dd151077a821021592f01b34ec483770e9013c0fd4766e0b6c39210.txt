     * Trim leading zeros from IPv4 address strings
     * Our base libraries will interpret that as octel..
     * Must leave non v4 addresses and host names alone.
     * For example, 192.168.000.010 -> 192.168.0.10
     * TODO - fix base libraries and remove this function
     * @param addr a string representing an ip addr
     * @return a string propertly trimmed
