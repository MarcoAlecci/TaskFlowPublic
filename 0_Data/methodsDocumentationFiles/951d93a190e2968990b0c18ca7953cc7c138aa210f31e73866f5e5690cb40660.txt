     * Get an indication of thread CPU usage.  The value returned
     * indicates the amount of time that the current thread has spent
     * executing code or waiting for certain types of I/O.
     *
     * The time is expressed in nanoseconds, and is only meaningful
     * when compared to the result from an earlier call.  Note that
     * nanosecond resolution does not imply nanosecond accuracy.
     *
     * On system which don't support this operation, the call returns -1.
