     * Requests receiving trigger events for a trigger sensor.
     *
     * <p>
     * When the sensor detects a trigger event condition, such as significant motion in
     * the case of the {@link Sensor#TYPE_SIGNIFICANT_MOTION}, the provided trigger listener
     * will be invoked once and then its request to receive trigger events will be canceled.
     * To continue receiving trigger events, the application must request to receive trigger
     * events again.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param listener The listener on which the
     *        {@link TriggerEventListener#onTrigger(TriggerEvent)} will be delivered.
     * @param sensor The sensor to be enabled.
     *
     * @return true if the sensor was successfully enabled.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException when sensor is null or not a trigger sensor.
