     * Sets the node before which this one is visited during traversal. A screen-reader
     * must visit the content of this node before the content of the one it precedes.
     * The successor is a virtual descendant of the given <code>root</code>. If
     * <code>virtualDescendantId</code> equals to {@link View#NO_ID} the root is set
     * as the successor.
     * <p>
     * A virtual descendant is an imaginary View that is reported as a part of the view
     * hierarchy for accessibility purposes. This enables custom views that draw complex
     * content to report them selves as a tree of virtual views, thus conveying their
     * logical structure.
