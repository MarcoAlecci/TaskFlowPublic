     * Encodes as many characters as possible from the given input buffer,
     * writing the results to the given output buffer.
     *
     * <p> The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
     * positions.  At most {@link Buffer#remaining in.remaining()} characters
     * will be read and at most {@link Buffer#remaining out.remaining()}
     * bytes will be written.  The buffers' positions will be advanced to
     * reflect the characters read and the bytes written, but their marks and
     * limits will not be modified.
     *
     * <p> In addition to reading characters from the input buffer and writing
     * bytes to the output buffer, this method returns a {@link CoderResult}
     * object to describe its reason for termination:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     *   <li><p> {@link CoderResult#UNDERFLOW} indicates that as much of the
     *   input buffer as possible has been encoded.  If there is no further
     *   input then the invoker can proceed to the next step of the
     *   <a href="#steps">encoding operation</a>.  Otherwise this method
     *   should be invoked again with further input.  </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> {@link CoderResult#OVERFLOW} indicates that there is
     *   insufficient space in the output buffer to encode any more characters.
     *   This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has
     *   more {@linkplain Buffer#remaining remaining} bytes. This is
     *   typically done by draining any encoded bytes from the output
     *   buffer.  </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> A {@linkplain CoderResult#malformedForLength
     *   malformed-input} result indicates that a malformed-input
     *   error has been detected.  The malformed characters begin at the input
     *   buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed
     *   characters may be determined by invoking the result object's {@link
     *   CoderResult#length() length} method.  This case applies only if the
     *   {@linkplain #onMalformedInput malformed action} of this encoder
     *   is {@link CodingErrorAction#REPORT}; otherwise the malformed input
     *   will be ignored or replaced, as requested.  </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> An {@linkplain CoderResult#unmappableForLength
     *   unmappable-character} result indicates that an
     *   unmappable-character error has been detected.  The characters that
     *   encode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly
     *   incremented) position; the number of such characters may be determined
     *   by invoking the result object's {@link CoderResult#length() length}
     *   method.  This case applies only if the {@linkplain #onUnmappableCharacter
     *   unmappable action} of this encoder is {@link
     *   CodingErrorAction#REPORT}; otherwise the unmappable character will be
     *   ignored or replaced, as requested.  </p></li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same encoding
     * operation then care should be taken to preserve any characters remaining
     * in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation.
     *
     * <p> The <tt>endOfInput</tt> parameter advises this method as to whether
     * the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given
     * input buffer.  If there is a possibility of providing additional input
     * then the invoker should pass <tt>false</tt> for this parameter; if there
     * is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should
     * pass <tt>true</tt>.  It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite
     * common, to pass <tt>false</tt> in one invocation and later discover that
     * no further input was actually available.  It is critical, however, that
     * the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always
     * pass <tt>true</tt> so that any remaining unencoded input will be treated
     * as being malformed.
     *
     * <p> This method works by invoking the {@link #encodeLoop encodeLoop}
     * method, interpreting its results, handling error conditions, and
     * reinvoking it as necessary.  </p>
