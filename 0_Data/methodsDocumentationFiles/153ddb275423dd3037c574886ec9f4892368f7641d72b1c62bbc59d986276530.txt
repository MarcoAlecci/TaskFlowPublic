     * important to the user and for which you received a call to {@link
     * #onStartPrinterStateTracking(PrinterId)} asking you to observer their
     * state and reporting it to the system via {@link #addPrinters(List)}.
     * You will receive a call to {@link #onStopPrinterStateTracking(PrinterId)}
     * if you should stop tracking a printer.
