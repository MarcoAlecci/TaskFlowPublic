     * Called when the last activity of a task initiated by
     * {@link #startVoiceActivity(android.content.Intent)} has finished.  The default
     * implementation calls {@link #finish()} on the assumption that this represents
     * the completion of a voice action.  You can override the implementation if you would
     * like a different behavior.
     *
     * @param intent The original {@link Intent} supplied to
     * {@link #startVoiceActivity(android.content.Intent)}.
     * @param taskId Unique ID of the finished task.
