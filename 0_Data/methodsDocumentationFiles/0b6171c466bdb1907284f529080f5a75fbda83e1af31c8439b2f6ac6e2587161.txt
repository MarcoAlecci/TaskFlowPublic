     * Returns a copy of this WindowInsets with selected system window insets replaced
     * with new values.
     *
     * <p>Note: If the system window insets are already consumed, this method will return them
     * unchanged on {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q Q} and later. Prior to
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q Q}, the new values were applied regardless of
     * whether they were consumed, and this method returns invalid non-zero consumed insets.
     *
     * @param left New left inset in pixels
     * @param top New top inset in pixels
     * @param right New right inset in pixels
     * @param bottom New bottom inset in pixels
     * @return A modified copy of this WindowInsets
     * @deprecated use {@code Builder#Builder(WindowInsets)} with
     *             {@link Builder#setSystemWindowInsets(Insets)} instead.
