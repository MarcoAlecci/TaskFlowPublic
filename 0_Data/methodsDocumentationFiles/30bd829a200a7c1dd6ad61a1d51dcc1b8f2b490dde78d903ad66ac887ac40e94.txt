     * The number of full carrier cycles between the satellite and the receiver.
     *
     * <p>The reference frequency is given by the value of {@link #getCarrierFrequencyHz()}.
     *
     * <p>The value is only available if {@link #hasCarrierCycles()} is {@code true}.
     *
     * @deprecated use {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeMeters()} instead.
