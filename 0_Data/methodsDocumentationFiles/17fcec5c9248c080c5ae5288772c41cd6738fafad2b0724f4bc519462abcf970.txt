     * Copy into this Allocation from an array. This method does not guarantee
     * that the Allocation is compatible with the input buffer; it copies memory
     * without reinterpretation.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation does not have Vec3 Elements, then the size of the
     * array in bytes must be at least the size of the Allocation {@link
     * #getBytesSize getBytesSize()}.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation has Vec3 Elements and {@link #setAutoPadding AutoPadding}
     * is disabled, then the size of the array in bytes must be at least the size
     * of the Allocation {@link #getBytesSize getBytesSize()}. The padding bytes for
     * the cells must be part of the array.
     *
     * <p> If the Allocation has Vec3 Elements and {@link #setAutoPadding AutoPadding}
     * is enabled, then the size of the array in bytes must be at least 3/4 the size
     * of the Allocation {@link #getBytesSize getBytesSize()}. The padding bytes for
     * the cells must not be part of the array.
