     * Retrieves the charset that was detected by this
     * decoder&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(optional operation)</i>.
     *
     * <p> If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then this
     * method returns the actual charset once it has been detected.  After that
     * point, this method returns the same value for the duration of the
     * current decoding operation.  If not enough input bytes have yet been
     * read to determine the actual charset then this method throws an {@link
     * IllegalStateException}.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method always throws an {@link
     * UnsupportedOperationException}; it should be overridden by
     * auto-detecting decoders to return the appropriate value.  </p>
     *
