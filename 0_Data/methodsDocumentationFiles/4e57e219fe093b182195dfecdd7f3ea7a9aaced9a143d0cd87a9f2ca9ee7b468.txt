     * Applies any/all effects (patheffect, stroking) to src, returning the
     * result in dst. The result is that drawing src with this paint will be
     * the same as drawing dst with a default paint (at least from the
     * geometric perspective).
     *
     * @param src input path
     * @param dst output path (may be the same as src)
     * @return    true if the path should be filled, or false if it should be
     *                 drawn with a hairline (width == 0)
