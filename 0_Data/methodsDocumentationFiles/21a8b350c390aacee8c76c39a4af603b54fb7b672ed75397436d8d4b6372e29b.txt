     * Called when the scroll position of this RecyclerView changes. Subclasses should use
     * this method to respond to scrolling within the adapter's data set instead of an explicit
     * listener.
     *
     * <p>This method will always be invoked before listeners. If a subclass needs to perform
     * any additional upkeep or bookkeeping after scrolling but before listeners run,
     * this is a good place to do so.</p>
     *
     * <p>This differs from {@link View#onScrollChanged(int, int, int, int)} in that it receives
     * the distance scrolled in either direction within the adapter's data set instead of absolute
     * scroll coordinates. Since RecyclerView cannot compute the absolute scroll position from
     * any arbitrary point in the data set, <code>onScrollChanged</code> will always receive
     * the current {@link View#getScrollX()} and {@link View#getScrollY()} values which
     * do not correspond to the data set scroll position. However, some subclasses may choose
     * to use these fields as special offsets.</p>

     * @param dx horizontal distance scrolled in pixels
