     * Gets the formats used for the values passed into
     * <code>format</code> methods or returned from <code>parse</code>
     * methods. The indices of elements in the returned array
     * correspond to the argument indices used in the previously set
     * pattern string.
     * The order of formats in the returned array thus corresponds to
     * the order of elements in the <code>arguments</code> array passed
     * to the <code>format</code> methods or the result array returned
     * by the <code>parse</code> methods.
     * <p>
     * If an argument index is used for more than one format element
     * in the pattern string, then the format used for the last such
     * format element is returned in the array. If an argument index
     * is not used for any format element in the pattern string, then
     * null is returned in the array.

     * @return the formats used for the arguments within the pattern
