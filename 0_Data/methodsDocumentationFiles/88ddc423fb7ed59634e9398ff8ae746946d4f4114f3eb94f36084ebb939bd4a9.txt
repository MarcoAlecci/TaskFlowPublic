     * Checks if given number might *potentially* result in
     * a call to an emergency service on the current network.
     *
     * Specifically, this method will return true if the specified number
     * is an emergency number according to the list managed by the RIL or
     * SIM, *or* if the specified number simply starts with the same
     * digits as any of the emergency numbers listed in the RIL / SIM.
     *
     * This method is intended for internal use by the phone app when
     * deciding whether to allow ACTION_CALL intents from 3rd party apps
     * (where we're required to *not* allow emergency calls to be placed.)
     *
     * @param subId the subscription id of the SIM.
     * @param number the number to look up.
     * @return true if the number is in the list of emergency numbers
     *         listed in the RIL / SIM, *or* if the number starts with the
     *         same digits as any of those emergency numbers.
     *
     * @deprecated Please use {@link TelephonyManager#isPotentialEmergencyNumber(String)}
     *             instead.
