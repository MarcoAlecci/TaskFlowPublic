     * Create a secure L2CAP Connection-oriented Channel (CoC) {@link BluetoothServerSocket} and
     * assign a dynamic protocol/service multiplexer (PSM) value. This socket can be used to listen
     * for incoming connections. The supported Bluetooth transport is LE only.
     * <p>A remote device connecting to this socket will be authenticated and communication on this
     * socket will be encrypted.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothServerSocket#accept} to retrieve incoming connections from a listening
     * {@link BluetoothServerSocket}.
     * <p>The system will assign a dynamic PSM value. This PSM value can be read from the {@link
     * BluetoothServerSocket#getPsm()} and this value will be released when this server socket is
     * closed, Bluetooth is turned off, or the application exits unexpectedly.
     * <p>The mechanism of disclosing the assigned dynamic PSM value to the initiating peer is
     * defined and performed by the application.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothDevice#createL2capChannel(int)} to connect to this server
     * socket from another Android device that is given the PSM value.
     *
     * @return an L2CAP CoC BluetoothServerSocket
     * @throws IOException on error, for example Bluetooth not available, or insufficient
     * permissions, or unable to start this CoC
