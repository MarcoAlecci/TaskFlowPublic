     * Sets the send level of the player to the attached auxiliary effect.
     * See {@link #attachAuxEffect(int)}. The level value range is 0 to 1.0.
     * <p>By default the send level is 0, so even if an effect is attached to the player
     * this method must be called for the effect to be applied.
     * <p>Note that the passed level value is a raw scalar. UI controls should be scaled
     * logarithmically: the gain applied by audio framework ranges from -72dB to 0dB,
     * so an appropriate conversion from linear UI input x to level is:
     * x == 0 -> level = 0
     * 0 < x <= R -> level = 10^(72*(x-R)/20/R)
     * @param level send level scalar
