         * Indicate that SurfaceFlinger should wake up earlier than usual as a result of this
         * transaction. This should be used when the caller thinks that the scene is complex enough
         * that it's likely to hit GL composition, and thus, SurfaceFlinger needs to more time in
         * order not to miss frame deadlines.
         * <p>
         * Corresponds to setting ISurfaceComposer::eEarlyWakeup
         * @hide
