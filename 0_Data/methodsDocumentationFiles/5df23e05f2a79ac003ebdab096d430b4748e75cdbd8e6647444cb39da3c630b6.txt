     * Return whether the fullscreen extract view is shown.  This will only
     * return true if {@link #isFullscreenMode()} returns true, and in that
     * case its value depends on the last call to
     * {@link #setExtractViewShown(boolean)}.  This effectively lets you
     * determine if the application window is entirely covered (when this
     * returns true) or if some part of it may be shown (if this returns
     * false, though if {@link #isFullscreenMode()} returns true in that case
     * then it is probably only a sliver of the application).
