     * Returns a new bitmap that captures the alpha values of the original.
     * These values may be affected by the optional Paint parameter, which
     * can contain its own alpha, and may also contain a MaskFilter which
     * could change the actual dimensions of the resulting bitmap (e.g.
     * a blur maskfilter might enlarge the resulting bitmap). If offsetXY
     * is not null, it returns the amount to offset the returned bitmap so
     * that it will logically align with the original. For example, if the
     * paint contains a blur of radius 2, then offsetXY[] would contains
     * -2, -2, so that drawing the alpha bitmap offset by (-2, -2) and then
     * drawing the original would result in the blur visually aligning with
     * the original.
     *
     * <p>The initial density of the returned bitmap is the same as the original's.
     *
     * @param paint Optional paint used to modify the alpha values in the
     *              resulting bitmap. Pass null for default behavior.
     * @param offsetXY Optional array that returns the X (index 0) and Y
     *                 (index 1) offset needed to position the returned bitmap
     *                 so that it visually lines up with the original.
     * @return new bitmap containing the (optionally modified by paint) alpha
     *         channel of the original bitmap. This may be drawn with
     *         Canvas.drawBitmap(), where the color(s) will be taken from the
     *         paint that is passed to the draw call.
