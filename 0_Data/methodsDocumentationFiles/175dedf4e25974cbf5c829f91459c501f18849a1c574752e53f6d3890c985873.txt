     * Set a NFCID2 for the specified service.
     *
     * <p>The NFCID2 must be in range from "02FE000000000000" to "02FEFFFFFFFFFFFF".
     *
     * <p>If a NFCID2 was previously set for this service
     * (either statically through the manifest, or dynamically by using this API),
     * it will be replaced.
     *
     * <p>Note that you can only set the NFCID2 for a service that
     * is running under the same UID as the caller of this API. Typically
     * this means you need to call this from the same
     * package as the service itself, though UIDs can also
     * be shared between packages using shared UIDs.
     *
     * @param service The component name of the service
     * @param nfcid2 The NFCID2 to be registered
     * @return whether the setting was successful.
