     * This method is called by ViewGroup when a child view is about to be hidden in
     * container. This callback starts the process of a transition; we grab the starting
     * values, listen for changes to all of the children of the container, and start appropriate
     * animations.
     *
     * @param parent The parent ViewGroup of the View being hidden.
     * @param child The View being hidden.
     * @param newVisibility The new visibility value of the child View, either
     * {@link View#GONE} or {@link View#INVISIBLE}.
