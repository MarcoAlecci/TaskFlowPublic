     * Registers a SensorListener for given sensors.
     *
     * @deprecated This method is deprecated, use
     *             {@link SensorManager#registerListener(SensorEventListener, Sensor, int)}
     *             instead.
     *
     * @param listener
     *        sensor listener object
     *
     * @param sensors
     *        a bit masks of the sensors to register to
     *
     * @param rate
     *        rate of events. This is only a hint to the system. events may be
     *        received faster or slower than the specified rate. Usually events
     *        are received faster. The value must be one of
     *        {@link #SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL}, {@link #SENSOR_DELAY_UI},
     *        {@link #SENSOR_DELAY_GAME}, or {@link #SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST}.
     *
     * @return <code>true</code> if the sensor is supported and successfully
     *         enabled
