     * Called immediately after {@link #onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle)}
     * has returned, but before any saved state has been restored in to the view.
     * This gives subclasses a chance to initialize themselves once
     * they know their view hierarchy has been completely created.  The fragment's
     * view hierarchy is not however attached to its parent at this point.
     * @param view The View returned by {@link #onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle)}.
     * @param savedInstanceState If non-null, this fragment is being re-constructed
     * from a previous saved state as given here.
