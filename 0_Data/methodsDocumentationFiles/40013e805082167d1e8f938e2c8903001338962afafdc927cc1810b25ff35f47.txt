     * Gets the GPS receiver internal clock value in nanoseconds.
     * This can be either the 'local hardware clock' value ({@link #TYPE_LOCAL_HW_TIME}), or the
     * current GPS time derived inside GPS receiver ({@link #TYPE_GPS_TIME}).
     * {@link #getType()} defines the time reported.
     *
     * For 'local hardware clock' this value is expected to be monotonically increasing during the
     * reporting session. The real GPS time can be derived by compensating
     * {@link #getFullBiasInNs()} (when it is available) from this value.
     *
     * For 'GPS time' this value is expected to be the best estimation of current GPS time that GPS
     * receiver can achieve. {@link #getTimeUncertaintyInNs()} should be available when GPS time is
     * specified.
     *
     * Sub-nanosecond accuracy can be provided by means of {@link #getBiasInNs()}.
     * The reported time includes {@link #getTimeUncertaintyInNs()}.
