     * Returns a Unicode bidi mark matching the context directionality (LRM or RLM) if either the
     * overall or the entry directionality of a given string is opposite to the context
     * directionality. Putting this before the string (including its directionality declaration
     * wrapping) prevents it from "sticking" to other opposite-directionality text appearing before
     * it inline with only neutral content in between. Otherwise returns the empty string. While the
     * entry directionality is determined by scanning the beginning of the string, the overall
     * directionality is given explicitly by a heuristic to estimate the {@code str}'s directionality.
     *
     * @param str CharSequence before which the mark may need to appear.
     * @param heuristic The text direction heuristic that will be used to estimate the {@code str}'s
     *                  directionality.
     * @return LRM for RTL text in LTR context; RLM for LTR text in RTL context;
     *     else, the empty string.
