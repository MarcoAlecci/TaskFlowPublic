     * Calls glTexImage2D() on the current OpenGL context. If no context is
     * current the behavior is the same as calling glTexImage2D() with  no
     * current context, that is, eglGetError() will return the appropriate
     * error.
     * Unlike glTexImage2D() bitmap cannot be null and will raise an exception
     * in that case.
     * All other parameters are identical to those used for glTexImage2D().
     *
     * NOTE: this method doesn't change GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, you must make
     * sure to set it properly according to the supplied bitmap.
     *
     * Whether or not bitmap can have non power of two dimensions depends on
     * the current OpenGL context. Always check glGetError() some time
     * after calling this method, just like when using OpenGL directly.
