             * Detect any sockets in the calling app which have not been tagged using {@link
             * TrafficStats}. Tagging sockets can help you investigate network usage inside your
             * app, such as a narrowing down heavy usage to a specific library or component.
             *
             * <p>This currently does not detect sockets created in native code.
