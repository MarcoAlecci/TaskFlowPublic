     * Same as lineTo, but the coordinates are considered relative to the last
     * point on this contour. If there is no previous point, then a moveTo(0,0)
     * is inserted automatically.
     *
     * @param dx The amount to add to the x-coordinate of the previous point on
     *           this contour, to specify a line
     * @param dy The amount to add to the y-coordinate of the previous point on
     *           this contour, to specify a line
