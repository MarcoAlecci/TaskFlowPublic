     * Write a parcelable with "squash" -- that is, when the same instance is written to the
     * same Parcelable multiple times, instead of writing the entire instance multiple times,
     * only write it once, and in subsequent writes we'll only write the offset to the original
     * object.
     *
     * This approach does not work of the resulting Parcel is copied with {@link #appendFrom} with
     * a non-zero offset, so we do not enable this behavior by default. Instead, we only enable
     * it between {@link #allowSquashing} and {@link #restoreAllowSquashing}, in order to make sure
     * we only do so within each "top level" Parcelable.
     *
     * Usage: Use this method in {@link Parcelable#writeToParcel}.
     * If this method returns TRUE, it's a subsequent call, and the offset is already written,
     * so the caller doesn't have to do anything. If this method returns FALSE, it's the first
     * time for the instance to be written to this parcel. The caller has to proceed with its
     * {@link Parcelable#writeToParcel}.
     *
     * (See {@code ApplicationInfo} for the example.)
     *
     * @param p the target Parcelable to write.
