     * Obtain a CryptoSession object which can be used to encrypt, decrypt,
     * sign and verify messages or data using the session keys established
     * for the session using methods {@link #getKeyRequest} and
     * {@link #provideKeyResponse} using a session key server.
     *
     * @param sessionId the session ID for the session containing keys
     * to be used for encrypt, decrypt, sign and/or verify
     * @param cipherAlgorithm the algorithm to use for encryption and
     * decryption ciphers. The algorithm string conforms to JCA Standard
     * Names for Cipher Transforms and is case insensitive.  For example
     * "AES/CBC/NoPadding".
     * @param macAlgorithm the algorithm to use for sign and verify
     * The algorithm string conforms to JCA Standard Names for Mac
     * Algorithms and is case insensitive.  For example "HmacSHA256".
