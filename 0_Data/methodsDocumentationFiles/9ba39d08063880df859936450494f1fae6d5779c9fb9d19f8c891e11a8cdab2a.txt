     * This function is called every time the cursor is successfully scrolled
     * to a new position, giving the subclass a chance to update any state it
     * may have. If it returns false the move function will also do so and the
     * cursor will scroll to the beforeFirst position.
     *
     * @param oldPosition the position that we're moving from
     * @param newPosition the position that we're moving to
     * @return true if the move is successful, false otherwise
