     * Gets the input device descriptor, which is a stable identifier for an input device.
     * <p>
     * An input device descriptor uniquely identifies an input device.  Its value
     * is intended to be persistent across system restarts, and should not change even
     * if the input device is disconnected, reconnected or reconfigured at any time.
     * </p><p>
     * It is possible for there to be multiple {@link InputDevice} instances that have the
     * same input device descriptor.  This might happen in situations where a single
     * human input device registers multiple {@link InputDevice} instances (HID collections)
     * that describe separate features of the device, such as a keyboard that also
     * has a trackpad.  Alternately, it may be that the input devices are simply
     * indistinguishable, such as two keyboards made by the same manufacturer.
     * </p><p>
     * The input device descriptor returned by {@link #getDescriptor} should only be
     * used when an application needs to remember settings associated with a particular
     * input device.  For all other purposes when referring to a logical
     * {@link InputDevice} instance at runtime use the id returned by {@link #getId()}.

     * @return The input device descriptor.
