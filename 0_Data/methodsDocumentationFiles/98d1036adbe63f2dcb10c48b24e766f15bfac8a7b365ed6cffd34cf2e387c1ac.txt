     * Tells the underlying networking system that the caller wants to
     * begin using the named feature. The interpretation of {@code feature}
     * is completely up to each networking implementation.
     *
     * <p>This method requires the caller to hold either the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE} permission
     * or the ability to modify system settings as determined by
     * {@link android.provider.Settings.System#canWrite}.</p>
     *
     * @param networkType specifies which network the request pertains to
     * @param feature the name of the feature to be used
     * @return an integer value representing the outcome of the request.
     * The interpretation of this value is specific to each networking
     * implementation+feature combination, except that the value {@code -1}
     * always indicates failure.
     *
     * @deprecated Deprecated in favor of the cleaner
     *             {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)} API.
     *             In {@link VERSION_CODES#M}, and above, this method is unsupported and will
     *             throw {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if called.
