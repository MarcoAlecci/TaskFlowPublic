         *
         * <p>A VPN network is classified as metered when the user is sensitive to heavy data usage
         * due to monetary costs and/or data limitations. In such cases, you should set this to
         * {@code true} so that apps on the system can avoid doing large data transfers. Otherwise,
         * set this to {@code false}. Doing so would cause VPN network to inherit its meteredness
         * from the underlying network.
         *
         * @param isMetered {@code true} if the VPN network should be treated as metered regardless
         *     of underlying network meteredness. Defaults to {@code true}.
