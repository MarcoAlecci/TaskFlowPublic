     * @deprecated Custom toast views are deprecated. Apps can create a standard text toast with the
     *      {@link #makeText(Context, CharSequence, int)} method, or use a
     *      <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/material/snackbar/Snackbar">Snackbar</a>
     *      when in the foreground. Starting from Android {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#R}, apps
     *      targeting API level {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#R} or higher that are in the background
     *      will not have custom toast views displayed.
