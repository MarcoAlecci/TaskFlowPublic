     * Return the number of bytes between rows in the bitmap's pixels. Note that
     * this refers to the pixels as stored natively by the bitmap. If you call
     * getPixels() or setPixels(), then the pixels are uniformly treated as
     * 32bit values, packed according to the Color class.
     *
     * <p>As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, this method
     * should not be used to calculate the memory usage of the bitmap. Instead,
     * see {@link #getAllocationByteCount()}.

     * @return number of bytes between rows of the native bitmap pixels.
