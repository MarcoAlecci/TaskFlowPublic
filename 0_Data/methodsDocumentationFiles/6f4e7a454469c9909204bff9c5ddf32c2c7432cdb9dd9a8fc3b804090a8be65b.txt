     * Configures the codec (e.g. encoder) to use a persistent input surface in place of input
     * buffers.  This may only be called after {@link #configure} and before {@link #start}, in
     * lieu of {@link #createInputSurface}.
     * @param surface a persistent input surface created by {@link #createPersistentInputSurface}
     * @throws IllegalStateException if not in the Configured state or does not require an input
     *           surface.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the surface was not created by
     *           {@link #createPersistentInputSurface}.
