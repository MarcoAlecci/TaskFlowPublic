     * Sets the desired video encoding profile and level for recording. The profile and level
     * must be valid for the video encoder set by {@link #setVideoEncoder}. This method can
     * called before or after {@link #setVideoEncoder} but it must be called before {@link #prepare}.
     * {@code prepare()} may perform additional checks on the parameter to make sure that the specified
     * profile and level are applicable, and sometimes the passed profile or level will be
     * discarded due to codec capablity or to ensure the video recording can proceed smoothly
     * based on the capabilities of the platform. <br>Application can also use the
     * {@link MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities#profileLevels} to query applicable combination of profile
     * and level for the corresponding format. Note that the requested profile/level may not be supported by
     * the codec that is actually being used by this MediaRecorder instance.
     * @param profile declared in {@link MediaCodecInfo.CodecProfileLevel}.
     * @param level declared in {@link MediaCodecInfo.CodecProfileLevel}.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException when an invalid profile or level value is used.
