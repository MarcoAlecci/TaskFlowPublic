     * If the OS encounters an error while processing {@link RestoreDescription#TYPE_FULL_STREAM}
     * data for restore, it will invoke this method to tell the transport that it should
     * abandon the data download for the current package.  The OS will then either call
     * {@link #nextRestorePackage()} again to move on to restoring the next package in the
     * set being iterated over, or will call {@link #finishRestore()} to shut down the restore
     * operation.
     *
     * @return {@link #TRANSPORT_OK} if the transport was successful in shutting down the
     *    current stream cleanly, or {@link #TRANSPORT_ERROR} to indicate a serious
     *    transport-level failure.  If the transport reports an error here, the entire restore
     *    operation will immediately be finished with no further attempts to restore app data.
