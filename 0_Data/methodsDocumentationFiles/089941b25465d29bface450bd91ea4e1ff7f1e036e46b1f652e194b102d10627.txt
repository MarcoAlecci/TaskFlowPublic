     * <p>No NFC features will work after this call, and the hardware
     * will not perform or respond to any NFC communication.
     *
     * <p>This call is asynchronous. Listen for
     * {@link #ACTION_ADAPTER_STATE_CHANGED} broadcasts to find out when the
     * operation is complete.
     *
     * <p>If this returns true, then either NFC is already off, or
     * a {@link #ACTION_ADAPTER_STATE_CHANGED} broadcast will be sent
     * to indicate a state transition. If this returns false, then
     * there is some problem that prevents an attempt to turn
     * NFC off.
