         * Returns true if the RecyclerView is currently measuring the layout. This value is
         * {@code true} only if the LayoutManager opted into the auto measure API and RecyclerView
         * has non-exact measurement specs.
         * <p>
         * Note that if the LayoutManager supports predictive animations and it is calculating the
         * pre-layout step, this value will be {@code false} even if the RecyclerView is in
         * {@code onMeasure} call. This is because pre-layout means the previous state of the
         * RecyclerView and measurements made for that state cannot change the RecyclerView's size.
         * LayoutManager is always guaranteed to receive another call to
         * {@link LayoutManager#onLayoutChildren(Recycler, State)} when this happens.
         *
         * @return True if the RecyclerView is currently calculating its bounds, false otherwise.
