     * Sets the stack trace elements that will be returned by
     * {@link #getStackTrace()} and printed by {@link #printStackTrace()}
     * and related methods.
     *
     * This method, which is designed for use by RPC frameworks and other
     * advanced systems, allows the client to override the default
     * stack trace that is either generated by {@link #fillInStackTrace()}
     * when a throwable is constructed or deserialized when a throwable is
     * read from a serialization stream.
     *
     * <p>If the stack trace of this {@code Throwable} {@linkplain
     * Throwable#Throwable(String, Throwable, boolean, boolean) is not
     * writable}, calling this method has no effect other than
     * validating its argument.
     *
     * @param   stackTrace the stack trace elements to be associated with
     * this {@code Throwable}.  The specified array is copied by this
     * call; changes in the specified array after the method invocation
     * returns will have no affect on this {@code Throwable}'s stack
     * trace.
     *
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code stackTrace} is
     *         {@code null} or if any of the elements of
     *         {@code stackTrace} are {@code null}
