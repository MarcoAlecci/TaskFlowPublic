         * To update the new playback speed, create a new {@link PlaybackState} by using {@link
         * PlaybackState.Builder#setState(int, long, float)}, and set it with
         * {@link #setPlaybackState(PlaybackState)}.
         * <p>
         * A value of {@code 1.0f} is the default playback value, and a negative value indicates
         * reverse playback. The {@code speed} will not be equal to zero.
