         * Convenience function for retrieving a single secure settings value
         * as a float.  Note that internally setting values are always
         * stored as strings; this function converts the string to a float
         * for you.
         * <p>
         * This version does not take a default value.  If the setting has not
         * been set, or the string value is not a number,
         * it throws {@link SettingNotFoundException}.
         *
         * @param cr The ContentResolver to access.
         * @param name The name of the setting to retrieve.
         *
         * @throws SettingNotFoundException Thrown if a setting by the given
         * name can't be found or the setting value is not a float.
         *
         * @return The setting's current value.
