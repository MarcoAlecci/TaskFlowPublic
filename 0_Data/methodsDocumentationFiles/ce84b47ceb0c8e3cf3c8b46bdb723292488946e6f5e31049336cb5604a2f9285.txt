         * In addition to the View Framework's measurement cache, RecyclerView uses its own
         * additional measurement cache for its children to avoid re-measuring them when not
         * necessary. It is on by default but it can be turned off via
         * {@link #setMeasurementCacheEnabled(boolean)}.
         *
         * @return True if measurement cache is enabled, false otherwise.
         *
         * @see #setMeasurementCacheEnabled(boolean)
