     * Returns the average relative jitter in milliseconds. Jitter represents the amount of variance
     * in interarrival time of packets, for example, if two packets are sent 2 milliseconds apart
     * but received 3 milliseconds apart, the relative jitter between those packets is 1
     * millisecond.

     * <p>See RFC 3550 for more information on jitter calculations.
