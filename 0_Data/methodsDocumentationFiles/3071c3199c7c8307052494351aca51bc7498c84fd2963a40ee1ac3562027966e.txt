     * Register to get a one shot callback for frame commit timing. Frame commit timing is the
     * time *after* traversals are done, as opposed to the animation frame timing, which is
     * before any traversals. This timing can be used to adjust the start time of an animation
     * when expensive traversals create big delta between the animation frame timing and the time
     * that animation is first shown on screen.
     *
     * Note this should only be called when the animation has already registered to receive
     * animation frame callbacks. This callback will be guaranteed to happen *after* the next
     * animation frame callback.
