     * Sets the maximal size of the historical data. Defaults to
     * {@link #DEFAULT_HISTORY_MAX_LENGTH}
     * <p>
     *   <strong>Note:</strong> Setting this property will immediately
     *   enforce the specified max history size by dropping enough old
     *   historical records to enforce the desired size. Thus, any
     *   records that exceed the history size will be discarded and
     *   irreversibly lost.

     * @param historyMaxSize The max history size.
