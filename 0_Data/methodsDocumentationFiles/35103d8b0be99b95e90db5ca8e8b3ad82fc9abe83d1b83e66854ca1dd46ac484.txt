     * After calling this method, calling any methods on this {@code Image} will
     * result in an {@link IllegalStateException}, and attempting to read from
     * or write to {@link ByteBuffer ByteBuffers} returned by an earlier
     * {@link Plane#getBuffer} call will have undefined behavior. If the image
     * was obtained from {@link ImageWriter} via
     * {@link ImageWriter#dequeueInputImage()}, after calling this method, any
     * image data filled by the application will be lost and the image will be
     * returned to {@link ImageWriter} for reuse. Images given to
     * {@link ImageWriter#queueInputImage queueInputImage()} are automatically
     * closed.
