     * Retrieve the official name associated with a uid. This name is
     * guaranteed to never change, though it is possible for the underlying
     * uid to be changed.  That is, if you are storing information about
     * uids in persistent storage, you should use the string returned
     * by this function instead of the raw uid.
     *
     * @param uid The uid for which you would like to retrieve a name.
     * @return Returns a unique name for the given uid, or null if the
     * uid is not currently assigned.
