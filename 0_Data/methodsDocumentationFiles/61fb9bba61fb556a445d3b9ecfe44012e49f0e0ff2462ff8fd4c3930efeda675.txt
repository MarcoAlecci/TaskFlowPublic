     *
     * <p>Restore the calling application from backup.  The data will be restored from the
     * current backup dataset if the application has stored data there, or from
     * the dataset used during the last full device setup operation if the current
     * backup dataset has no matching data.  If no backup data exists for this application
     * in either source, a nonzero value will be returned.
     *
     * <p>If this method returns zero (meaning success), the OS will attempt to retrieve
     * a backed-up dataset from the remote transport, instantiate the application's
     * backup agent, and pass the dataset to the agent's
     * {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent#onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()}
     * method.
     *
     * @param observer The {@link RestoreObserver} to receive callbacks during the restore
     * operation. This must not be null.
     *
     * @param monitor the {@link BackupManagerMonitor} to receive callbacks during the restore
     * operation.
     *
     * @return Zero on success; nonzero on error.
