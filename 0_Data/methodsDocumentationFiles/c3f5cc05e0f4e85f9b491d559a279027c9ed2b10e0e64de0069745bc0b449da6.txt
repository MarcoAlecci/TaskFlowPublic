         * Marks the VPN network as metered. A VPN network is classified as metered when the user is
         * sensitive to heavy data usage due to monetary costs and/or data limitations. In such
         * cases, you should set this to {@code true} so that apps on the system can avoid doing
         * large data transfers. Otherwise, set this to {@code false}. Doing so would cause VPN
         * network to inherit its meteredness from its underlying networks.
         *
         * <p>VPN apps targeting {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q} or above will be
         * considered metered by default.
