     * Returns the state of all calls on the device.
     * <p>
     * This method considers not only calls in the Telephony stack, but also calls via other
     * {@link android.telecom.ConnectionService} implementations.
     * <p>
     * Note: The call state returned via this method may differ from what is reported by
     * {@link PhoneStateListener#onCallStateChanged(int, String)}, as that callback only considers
     * Telephony (mobile) calls.
     *
     * @return the current call state.
