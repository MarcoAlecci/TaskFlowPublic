     * Returns a {@link Clock} that starts at January 1, 1970 00:00:00.0 UTC,
     * synchronized using a remote network source outside the device.
     * <p>
     * While the time returned by {@link System#currentTimeMillis()} can be
     * adjusted by the user, the time returned by this method cannot be adjusted
     * by the user. Note that synchronization may occur using an insecure
     * network protocol, so the returned time should not be used for security
     * purposes.
     * <p>
     * This performs no blocking network operations and returns values based on
     * a recent successful synchronization event; it will either return a valid
     * time or throw.
     *
     * @throws DateTimeException when no accurate network time can be provided.
