     * Comparison operator on two PendingIntent objects, such that true
     * is returned then they both represent the same operation from the
     * same package.  This allows you to use {@link #getActivity},
     * {@link #getBroadcast}, or {@link #getService} multiple times (even
     * across a process being killed), resulting in different PendingIntent
     * objects but whose equals() method identifies them as being the same
     * operation.
