     * Provides the default implementation of {@link InputConnection#sendKeyEvent(KeyEvent)}, which
     * is expected to dispatch an keyboard event sent from the IME to an appropriate event target
     * depending on the given {@link View} and the current focus state.
     *
     * <p>CAUTION: This method is provided only for the situation where
     * {@link InputConnection#sendKeyEvent(KeyEvent)} needs to be implemented without relying on
     * {@link BaseInputConnection}. Do not use this API for anything else.</p>
     *
     * @param targetView the default target view. If {@code null} is specified, then this method
     * tries to find a good event target based on the current focus state.
     * @param event the key event to be dispatched.
