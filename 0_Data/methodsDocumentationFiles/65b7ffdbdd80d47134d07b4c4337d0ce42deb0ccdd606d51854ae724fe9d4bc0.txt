     * <p>Causes the Runnable to be added to the message queue, to be run
     * after the specified amount of time elapses.
     * The runnable will be run on the user interface thread.</p>
     *
     * @param action The Runnable that will be executed.
     * @param delayMillis The delay (in milliseconds) until the Runnable
     *        will be executed.
     *
     * @return true if the Runnable was successfully placed in to the
     *         message queue.  Returns false on failure, usually because the
     *         looper processing the message queue is exiting.  Note that a
     *         result of true does not mean the Runnable will be processed --
     *         if the looper is quit before the delivery time of the message
     *         occurs then the message will be dropped.
