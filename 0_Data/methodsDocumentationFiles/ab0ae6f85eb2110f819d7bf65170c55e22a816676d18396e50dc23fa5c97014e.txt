     * Starts the animations set up for a CHANGING transition. We separate the setup of these
     * animations from actually starting them, to avoid side-effects that starting the animations
     * may have on the properties of the affected objects. After setup, we tell the affected parent
     * that this transition should be started. The parent informs its ViewAncestor, which then
     * starts the transition after the current layout/measurement phase, just prior to drawing
     * the view hierarchy.
