     * Flushes the audio data currently queued for playback. Any data that has
     * been written but not yet presented will be discarded.  No-op if not stopped or paused,
     * or if the track's creation mode is not {@link #MODE_STREAM}.
     * <BR> Note that although data written but not yet presented is discarded, there is no
     * guarantee that all of the buffer space formerly used by that data
     * is available for a subsequent write.
     * For example, a call to {@link #write(byte[], int, int)} with <code>sizeInBytes</code>
     * less than or equal to the total buffer size
     * may return a short actual transfer count.
