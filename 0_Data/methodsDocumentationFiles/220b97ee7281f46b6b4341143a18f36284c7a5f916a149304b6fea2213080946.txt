     * Gets the carrier frequency of the tracked signal.
     *
     * <p>For example it can be the GPS central frequency for L1 = 1575.45 MHz, or L2 = 1227.60 MHz,
     * L5 = 1176.45 MHz, varying GLO channels, etc.
     *
     * <p>For an L1, L5 receiver tracking a satellite on L1 and L5 at the same time, two correction
     * objects will be reported for this same satellite, in one of the correction objects, all the
     * values related to L1 will be filled, and in the other all of the values related to L5 will be
     * filled.
     *
     * @return the carrier frequency of the signal tracked in Hz.
