     * Explicitly set the storage location used internally by this class to be
     * credential-protected storage. This is the default storage area for apps
     * unless {@code forceDeviceProtectedStorage} was requested.
     * <p>
     * On devices with direct boot, data stored in this location is encrypted
     * with a key tied to user credentials, which can be accessed
     * <em>only after</em> the user has entered their credentials (such as a
     * lock pattern or PIN).
