     * Called when this view wants to give up focus. If focus is cleared
     * {@link #onFocusChanged(boolean, int, android.graphics.Rect)} is called.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> When not in touch-mode, the framework will try to give focus
     * to the first focusable View from the top after focus is cleared. Hence, if this
     * View is the first from the top that can take focus, then all callbacks
     * related to clearing focus will be invoked after which the framework will
     * give focus to this view.
