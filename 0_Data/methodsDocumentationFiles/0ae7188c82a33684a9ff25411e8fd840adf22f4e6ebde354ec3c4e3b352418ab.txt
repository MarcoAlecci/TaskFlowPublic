     * Retrieve a dimensional for a particular resource ID for use
     * as a size in raw pixels.  This is the same as
     * {@link #getDimension}, except the returned value is converted to
     * integer pixels for use as a size.  A size conversion involves
     * rounding the base value, and ensuring that a non-zero base value
     * is at least one pixel in size.
     * 
     * @param id The desired resource identifier, as generated by the aapt
     *           tool. This integer encodes the package, type, and resource
     *           entry. The value 0 is an invalid identifier.
     * 
     * @return Resource dimension value multiplied by the appropriate 
     * metric and truncated to integer pixels.
     *  
     * @throws NotFoundException Throws NotFoundException if the given ID does not exist.
