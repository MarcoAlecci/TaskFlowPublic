     * Relative bulk <i>put</i> method&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(optional operation)</i>.
     *
     * <p> This method transfers the floats remaining in the given source
     * buffer into this buffer.  If there are more floats remaining in the
     * source buffer than in this buffer, that is, if
     * <tt>src.remaining()</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&gt;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>remaining()</tt>,
     * then no floats are transferred and a {@link
     * BufferOverflowException} is thrown.
     *
     * <p> Otherwise, this method copies
     * <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<tt>src.remaining()</tt> floats from the given
     * buffer into this buffer, starting at each buffer's current position.
     * The positions of both buffers are then incremented by <i>n</i>.
     *
     * <p> In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
     * <tt>dst.put(src)</tt> has exactly the same effect as the loop
     *
     * <pre>
     *     while (src.hasRemaining())
     *         dst.put(src.get()); </pre>
     *
     * except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this
     * buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.
     *
     * @param  src
     *         The source buffer from which floats are to be read;

     * @throws  BufferOverflowException
     *          If there is insufficient space in this buffer
     *          for the remaining floats in the source buffer

     *          If the source buffer is this buffer
