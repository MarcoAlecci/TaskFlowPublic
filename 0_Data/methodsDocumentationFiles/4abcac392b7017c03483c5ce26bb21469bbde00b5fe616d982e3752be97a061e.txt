     * Returns a string resulting from replacing all occurrences of
     * {@code oldChar} in this string with {@code newChar}.
     * <p>
     * If the character {@code oldChar} does not occur in the
     * character sequence represented by this {@code String} object,
     * then a reference to this {@code String} object is returned.
     * Otherwise, a {@code String} object is returned that
     * represents a character sequence identical to the character sequence
     * represented by this {@code String} object, except that every
     * occurrence of {@code oldChar} is replaced by an occurrence
     * of {@code newChar}.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * "mesquite in your cellar".replace('e', 'o')
     *         returns "mosquito in your collar"
     * "the war of baronets".replace('r', 'y')
     *         returns "the way of bayonets"
     * "sparring with a purple porpoise".replace('p', 't')
     *         returns "starring with a turtle tortoise"
     * "JonL".replace('q', 'x') returns "JonL" (no change)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @param   oldChar   the old character.
     * @param   newChar   the new character.
     * @return  a string derived from this string by replacing every
     *          occurrence of {@code oldChar} with {@code newChar}.
