     * Gets the accumulated delta range since the last channel reset, in meters.
     * The reported value includes {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeUncertaintyInMeters()}.
     *
     * The availability of the value is represented by {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeState()}.
     *
     * A positive value indicates that the SV is moving away from the receiver.
     * The sign of {@link #getAccumulatedDeltaRangeInMeters()} and its relation to the sign of
     * {@link #getCarrierPhase()} is given by the equation:
     *          accumulated delta range = -k * carrier phase    (where k is a constant)
