     * Gets the data of the reported GPS message.
     *
     * <p>The bytes (or words) specified using big endian format (MSB first).
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>For GPS L1 C/A, Beidou D1 &amp; Beidou D2, each subframe contains 10 30-bit words. Each
     * word (30 bits) should be fit into the last 30 bits in a 4-byte word (skip B31 and B32), with
     * MSB first, for a total of 40 bytes, covering a time period of 6, 6, and 0.6 seconds,
     * respectively.</li>
     * <li>For Glonass L1 C/A, each string contains 85 data bits, including the checksum.  These
     * bits should be fit into 11 bytes, with MSB first (skip B86-B88), covering a time period of 2
     * seconds.</li>
     * <li>For Galileo F/NAV, each word consists of 238-bit (sync &amp; tail symbols excluded). Each
     * word should be fit into 30-bytes, with MSB first (skip B239, B240), covering a time period of
     * 10 seconds.</li>
     * <li>For Galileo I/NAV, each page contains 2 page parts, even and odd, with a total of 2x114 =
     * 228 bits, (sync &amp; tail excluded) that should be fit into 29 bytes, with MSB first (skip
     * B229-B232).</li>
     * <li>For SBAS, each block consists of 250 data bits, that should be fit into 32 bytes.  MSB
     * first (skip B251-B256).</li>
     * <li>For Beidou CNAV1, subframe #1 consists of 14 data bits, that should be fit into 2
     * bytes. MSB first (skip B15-B16).  subframe #2 consists of 600 bits that should be fit into
     * 75 bytes. subframe #3 consists of 264 data bits that should be fit into 33 bytes.</li>
     * <li>For Beidou CNAV2, each subframe consists of 288 data bits, that should be fit into 36
     * bytes.</li>
     * </ul>
