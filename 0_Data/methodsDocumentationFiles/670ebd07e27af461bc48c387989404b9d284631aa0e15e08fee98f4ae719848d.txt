     * Configures the ambient & spot shadow alphas. This is the alpha used when the shadow
     * has max alpha, and ramps down from the values provided to zero.
     *
     * <p>These values are typically provided by the current theme, see
     * {@link android.R.attr#spotShadowAlpha} and {@link android.R.attr#ambientShadowAlpha}.
     *
     * <p>This must be set at least once along with
     * {@link #setLightSourceGeometry(float, float, float, float)} before shadows will work.
     *
     * @param ambientShadowAlpha The alpha for the ambient shadow. If unsure, a reasonable default
     *                           is 0.039f.
     * @param spotShadowAlpha    The alpha for the spot shadow. If unsure, a reasonable default is
     *                           0.19f.
