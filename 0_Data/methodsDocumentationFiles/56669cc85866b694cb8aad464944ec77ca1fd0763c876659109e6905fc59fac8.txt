     * Instantiates an X509Certificate object, and initializes it with
     * the data read from the input stream {@code inStream}.
     * The implementation (X509Certificate is an abstract class) is
     * provided by the class specified as the value of the
     * {@code cert.provider.x509v1} security property.
     *
     * <p>Note: Only one DER-encoded
     * certificate is expected to be in the input stream.
     * Also, all X509Certificate
     * subclasses must provide a constructor of the form:
     * <pre>{@code
     * public <subClass>(InputStream inStream) ...
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param inStream an input stream with the data to be read to
     *        initialize the certificate.
     * @return an X509Certificate object initialized with the data
     *         from the input stream.
     * @exception CertificateException if a class initialization
     *            or certificate parsing error occurs.
