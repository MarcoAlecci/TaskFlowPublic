     * Returns the count of 7-bit GSM alphabet characters
     * needed to represent this string, and the language table and
     * language shift table used to achieve this result.
     * For multi-part text messages, each message part may use its
     * own language table encoding as specified in the message header
     * for that message. However, this method will only return the
     * optimal encoding for the message as a whole. When the individual
     * pieces are encoded, a more optimal encoding may be chosen for each
     * piece of the message, but the message will be split into pieces
     * based on the encoding chosen for the message as a whole.
     * @param s the Unicode string that will be encoded
     * @param use7bitOnly allow using space in place of unencodable character if true,
     *     using the language table pair with the fewest unencodable characters
     * @return a TextEncodingDetails object containing the message and
     *     character counts for the most efficient 7-bit encoding,
     *     or null if there are no suitable language tables to encode the string.
