     * Restore an undo state previously created with {@link #saveInstanceState(Parcel)}.  This
     * will restore the UndoManager's state to almost exactly what it was at the point it had
     * been previously saved; the only information not restored is the data object
     * associated with each {@link UndoOwner}, which requires separate calls to
     * {@link #getOwner(String, Object)} to re-associate the owner with its data.
