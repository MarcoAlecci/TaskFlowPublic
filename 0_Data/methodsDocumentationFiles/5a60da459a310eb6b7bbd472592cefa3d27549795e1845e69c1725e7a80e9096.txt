     * @param request the settings for this capture
     * @param executor the executor which will be used for invoking the listener.
     * @param listener The callback object to notify once this request has been

     * @throws IllegalStateException if this session is no longer active, either because the session
     *                               was explicitly closed, a new session has been created
     *                               or the camera device has been closed.

     *                                  non-reprocessable capture session; or the reprocess capture
     *                                  request was created with a {@link TotalCaptureResult} from
