     * given the properties of the specified Paint,
     * or, if it does not fit, a copy with ellipsis character added
     * at the specified edge or center.
     * If <code>preserveLength</code> is specified, the returned copy
     * will be padded with zero-width spaces to preserve the original
     * length and offsets instead of truncating.
     * If <code>callback</code> is non-null, it will be called to
     * report the start and end of the ellipsized range.
