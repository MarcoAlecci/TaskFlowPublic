     * that was sent to the server for certificate-based ciphersuites or,
     * return null for non-certificate based ciphersuites, such as Kerberos.

     * @return the principal sent to the server. Returns an X500Principal
     * of the end-entity certificate for X509-based cipher suites, and
     * KerberosPrincipal for Kerberos cipher suites. If no principal was
     * sent, then null is returned.
