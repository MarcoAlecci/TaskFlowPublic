         * Tunes to a given channel. Override this method in order to handle domain-specific
         * features that are only known between certain TV inputs and their clients.
         *
         * <p>The default implementation calls {@link #onTune(Uri)}.
         *
         * @param channelUri The URI of the channel.
         * @param params Domain-specific data for this tune request. Keys <em>must</em> be a scoped
         *            name, i.e. prefixed with a package name you own, so that different developers
         *            will not create conflicting keys.
         * @return {@code true} if the tuning was successful, {@code false} otherwise.
