     * Checks whether a bitmap is grayscale. Grayscale here means "very close to a perfect
     * gray".
     *
     * Instead of scanning every pixel in the bitmap, we first resize the bitmap to no more than
     * COMPACT_BITMAP_SIZE^2 pixels using filtering. The hope is that any non-gray color elements
     * will survive the squeezing process, contaminating the result with color.
