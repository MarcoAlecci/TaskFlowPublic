         * A session is considered active whenever there is ongoing forward
         * progress being made, such as the installer holding an open
         * {@link Session} instance while streaming data into place, or the
         * system optimizing code as the result of
         * {@link Session#commit(IntentSender)}.
         * <p>
         * If the installer closes the {@link Session} without committing, the
         * session is considered inactive until the installer opens the session
         * again.
