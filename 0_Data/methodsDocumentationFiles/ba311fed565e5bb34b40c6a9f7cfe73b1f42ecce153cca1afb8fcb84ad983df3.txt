     * Create a new IpSecTunnelInterface as a local endpoint for tunneled IPsec traffic.
     *
     * <p>An application that creates tunnels is responsible for cleaning up the tunnel when the
     * underlying network goes away, and the onLost() callback is received.
     *
     * @param localAddress The local addres of the tunnel
     * @param remoteAddress The local addres of the tunnel
     * @param underlyingNetwork the {@link Network} that will carry traffic for this tunnel.
     *        This network should almost certainly be a network such as WiFi with an L2 address.
     * @return a new {@link IpSecManager#IpSecTunnelInterface} with the specified properties
     * @throws IOException indicating that the socket could not be opened or bound
     * @throws ResourceUnavailableException indicating that too many encapsulation sockets are open
