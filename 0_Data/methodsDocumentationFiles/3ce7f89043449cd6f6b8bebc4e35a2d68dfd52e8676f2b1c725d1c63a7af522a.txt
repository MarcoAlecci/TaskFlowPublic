     * This is called whenever the system captures an unhandled exception that
     * was thrown by the application.  The default implementation simply
     * returns false, allowing normal system handling of the exception to take
     * place.
     * 
     * @param obj The client object that generated the exception.  May be an
     *            Application, Activity, BroadcastReceiver, Service, or null.
     * @param e The exception that was thrown.
     *  
     * @return To allow normal system exception process to occur, return false.
     *         If true is returned, the system will proceed as if the exception
     *         didn't happen.
