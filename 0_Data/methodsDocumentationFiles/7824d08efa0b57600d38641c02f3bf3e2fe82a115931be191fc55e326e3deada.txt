     * Registers a System Code for the specified service.
     *
     * <p>The System Code must be in range from "4000" to "4FFF" (excluding "4*FF").
     *
     * <p>If a System Code was previously registered for this service
     * (either statically through the manifest, or dynamically by using this API),
     * it will be replaced with this one.
     *
     * <p>Even if the same System Code is already registered for another service,
     * this method succeeds in registering the System Code.
     *
     * <p>Note that you can only register a System Code for a service that
     * is running under the same UID as the caller of this API. Typically
     * this means you need to call this from the same
     * package as the service itself, though UIDs can also
     * be shared between packages using shared UIDs.
     *
     * @param service The component name of the service
     * @param systemCode The System Code to be registered
     * @return whether the registration was successful.
