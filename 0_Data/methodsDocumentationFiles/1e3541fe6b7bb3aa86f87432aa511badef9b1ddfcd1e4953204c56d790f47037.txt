     * Returns the value of a system property converted to a boolean using specific logic.
     *
     * Note that Device Config is not available without an application so SystemProperties is used
     * instead.
     *
     * @see SystemProperties#getBoolean
     *
     * TODO (chriswailes): Cache the system property location in native code and then write a JNI
     *                     function to fetch it.
     * TODO (chriswailes): Move into ZygoteConfig.java once the necessary CL lands (go/ag/6580627)
