     * Constructs a channel that writes bytes to the given stream.
     *
     * <p> The resulting channel will not be buffered; it will simply redirect
     * its I/O operations to the given stream.  Closing the channel will in
     * turn cause the stream to be closed.  </p>
     *
     * @param  out
     *         The stream to which bytes are to be written
