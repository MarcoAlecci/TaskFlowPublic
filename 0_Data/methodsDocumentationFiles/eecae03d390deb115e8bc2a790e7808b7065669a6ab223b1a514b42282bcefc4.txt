         * Start an activity in this task.  Brings the task to the foreground.  If this task
         * is not currently active (that is, its id < 0), then a new activity for the given
         * Intent will be launched as the root of the task and the task brought to the
         * foreground.  Otherwise, if this task is currently active and the Intent does not specify
         * an activity to launch in a new task, then a new activity for the given Intent will
         * be launched on top of the task and the task brought to the foreground.  If this
         * task is currently active and the Intent specifies {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK}
         * or would otherwise be launched in to a new task, then the activity not launched but
         * this task be brought to the foreground and a new intent delivered to the top
         * activity if appropriate.
         *
         * <p>In other words, you generally want to use an Intent here that does not specify
         * {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} or {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT},
         * and let the system do the right thing.</p>
