     * Returns a well-formed BCP 47 language tag representation of the suggestions, as a
     * {@link Locale} object.

     * <p><b>Caveat</b>: The returned object is guaranteed to be a  a well-formed BCP 47 language tag
     * representation.  For example, this method can return an empty locale rather than returning a
     * malformed data when this object is initialized with an malformed {@link Locale} object, e.g.
     * {@code new Locale(" a ", " b c d ", " "}.</p>
     *
     * @return the locale of the suggestions. {@code null} is returned if no locale is specified.
