     * Gets the optional intent data for use with these suggestions.  This is
     * useful if all intents will have similar data URIs,
     * but you'll likely need to provide a specific ID as well via the column
     * {@link SearchManager#SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA_ID}, which will be appended to the
     * intent data URI.
     * 
     * This can be overriden in any given suggestion using the column
     * {@link SearchManager#SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA}.
     * 
     * @return The default intent data, or {@code null} if not set.
