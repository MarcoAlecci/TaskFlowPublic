     * Checks whether a CA certificate is added by an user.
     *
     * <p>Since {@link X509TrustManager#checkServerTrusted} may allow its parameter {@code chain} to
     * chain up to user-added CA certificates, this method can be used to perform additional
     * policies for user-added CA certificates.
     *
     * @return {@code true} to indicate that the certificate authority exists in the user added
     * certificate store, {@code false} otherwise.
