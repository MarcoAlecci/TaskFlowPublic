     * Called when activity gets or loses the top resumed position in the system.
     *
     * <p>Starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q} multiple activities can be resumed
     * at the same time in multi-window and multi-display modes. This callback should be used
     * instead of {@link #onResume()} as an indication that the activity can try to open
     * exclusive-access devices like camera.</p>
     *
     * <p>It will always be delivered after the activity was resumed and before it is paused. In
     * some cases it might be skipped and activity can go straight from {@link #onResume()} to
     * {@link #onPause()} without receiving the top resumed state.</p>
     *
     * @param isTopResumedActivity {@code true} if it's the topmost resumed activity in the system,
     *                             {@code false} otherwise. A call with this as {@code true} will
     *                             always be followed by another one with {@code false}.
