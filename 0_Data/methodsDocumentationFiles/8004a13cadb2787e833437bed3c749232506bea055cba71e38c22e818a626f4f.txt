     * Create an arbitrary window into the base allocation.
     * The type describes the shape of the window.
     *
     * Any dimensions present in the type must be equal or smaller
     * to the dimensions in the source allocation.  A dimension
     * present in the allocation that is not present in the type
     * will be constrained away with the selectors.
     *
     * If a dimension is present in both the type and allocation, one of
     * two things will happen.
     *
     * If the type is smaller than the allocation, a window will be
     * created, the selected value in the adapter for that dimension
     * will act as the base address, and the type will describe the
     * size of the view starting at that point.
     *
     * If the type and allocation dimension are of the same size,
     * then setting the selector for the dimension will be an error.
