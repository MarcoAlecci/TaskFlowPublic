         * video associated with the current {@link Connection} has changed.

         * This could be in response to a preview request via
         * {@link #onRequestConnectionDataUsage()}, or as a periodic update by the
         * {@link VideoProvider}.  Where periodic updates of data usage are provided, they should be
         * provided at most for every 1 MB of data transferred and no more than once every 10 sec.
         * <p>
         * Received by the {@link InCallService} via
         * {@link InCallService.VideoCall.Callback#onCallDataUsageChanged(long)}.
         *
         * @param dataUsage The updated data usage (in bytes).  Reported as the cumulative bytes
