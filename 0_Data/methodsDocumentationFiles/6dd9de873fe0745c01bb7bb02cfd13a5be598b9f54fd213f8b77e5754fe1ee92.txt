     * Specifies whether an {@link Activity} should be shown on top of the lock screen whenever
     * the lockscreen is up and the activity is resumed. Normally an activity will be transitioned
     * to the stopped state if it is started while the lockscreen is up, but with this flag set the
     * activity will remain in the resumed state visible on-top of the lock screen. This value can
     * be set as a manifest attribute using {@link android.R.attr#showWhenLocked}.
     *
     * @param showWhenLocked {@code true} to show the {@link Activity} on top of the lock screen;
     *                                   {@code false} otherwise.
