     * Creates an {@code Iterator} from a {@code Spliterator}.
     *
     * <p>Traversal of elements should be accomplished through the iterator.
     * The behaviour of traversal is undefined if the spliterator is operated
     * after the iterator is returned.
     *
     * @param <T> Type of elements
     * @param spliterator The spliterator
     * @return An iterator
     * @throws NullPointerException if the given spliterator is {@code null}
