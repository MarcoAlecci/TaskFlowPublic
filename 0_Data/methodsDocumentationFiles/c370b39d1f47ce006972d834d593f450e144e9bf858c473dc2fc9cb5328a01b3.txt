     * If the target user is a managed profile, then this returns a badged copy of the given icon
     * to be able to distinguish it from the original icon. For badging an arbitrary drawable use
     * {@link #getUserBadgedDrawableForDensity(
     * android.graphics.drawable.Drawable, UserHandle, android.graphics.Rect, int)}.
     * <p>
     * If the original drawable is a BitmapDrawable and the backing bitmap is
     * mutable as per {@link android.graphics.Bitmap#isMutable()}, the badging
     * is performed in place and the original drawable is returned.

     * @param drawable The drawable to badge.
     * @param user The target user.
     * @return A drawable that combines the original icon and a badge as
     *         determined by the system.
