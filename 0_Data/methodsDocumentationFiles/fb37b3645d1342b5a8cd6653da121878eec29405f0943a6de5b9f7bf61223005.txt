         * Called when the application requests to start TV program recording. Recording must start
         * immediately when this method is called.
         *
         * <p>The application may supply the URI for a TV program for filling in program specific
         * data fields in the {@link android.media.tv.TvContract.RecordedPrograms} table.
         * A non-null {@code programUri} implies the started recording should be of that specific
         * program, whereas null {@code programUri} does not impose such a requirement and the
         * recording can span across multiple TV programs. In either case, the application must call
         * {@link TvRecordingClient#stopRecording()} to stop the recording.
         *
         * <p>The session must call {@link #notifyError(int)} if the start request cannot be
         * fulfilled.
         *
         * @param programUri The URI for the TV program to record, built by
         *            {@link TvContract#buildProgramUri(long)}. Can be {@code null}.
         * @param params Domain-specific data for this tune request. Keys <em>must</em> be a scoped
         *            name, i.e. prefixed with a package name you own, so that different developers
         *            will not create conflicting keys.
