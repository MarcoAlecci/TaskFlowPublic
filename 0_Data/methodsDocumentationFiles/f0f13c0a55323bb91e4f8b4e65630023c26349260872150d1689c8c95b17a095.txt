     * Converts a series of bytes to an integer. This method currently only supports positive 32-bit
     * integers.
     *
     * @param src The source bytes.
     * @param offset The position of the first byte of the data to be converted. The data is base
     *     256 with the most significant digit first.
     * @param length The length of the data to be converted. It must be <= 4.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If {@code length} is bigger than 4 or {@code src} cannot be
     *     parsed as a positive integer.
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException If the range defined by {@code offset} and {@code length}
     *     exceeds the bounds of {@code src}.
