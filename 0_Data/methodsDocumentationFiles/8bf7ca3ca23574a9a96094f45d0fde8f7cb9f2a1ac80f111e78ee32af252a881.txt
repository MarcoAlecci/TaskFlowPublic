     * Saves the current matrix and clip onto a private stack.
     * <p>
     * Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect,
     * clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to
     * restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that
     * existed before the save() will be reinstated.
     *
     * @return The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
