     * Returns the list of "default" carrier app candidates.
     *
     * These are the apps subject to the hiding/showing logic in
     * {@link CarrierAppUtils#disableCarrierAppsUntilPrivileged(String, TelephonyManager, int,
     * Context)}, as well as the apps which should have default
     * permissions granted, when a matching SIM is inserted.
     *
     * Whether or not the app is actually considered a default app depends on whether the app has
     * carrier privileges as determined by the SIMs in the device.
