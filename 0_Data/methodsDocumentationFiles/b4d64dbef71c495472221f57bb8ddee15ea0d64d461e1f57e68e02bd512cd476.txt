     * Convenience method to simply change to the given scene using
     * the given transition.
     *
     * <p>Passing in <code>null</code> for the transition parameter will
     * result in the scene changing without any transition running, and is
     * equivalent to calling {@link Scene#exit()} on the scene root's
     * current scene, followed by {@link Scene#enter()} on the scene
     * specified by the <code>scene</code> parameter.</p>
     *
     * @param scene The Scene to change to
     * @param transition The transition to use for this scene change. A
     * value of null causes the scene change to happen with no transition.
