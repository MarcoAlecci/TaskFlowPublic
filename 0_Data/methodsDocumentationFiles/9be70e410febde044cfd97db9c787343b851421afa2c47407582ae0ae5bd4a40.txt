     * Read and distribute CPU usage across apps. If their are partial wakelocks being held
     * and we are on battery with screen off, we give more of the cpu time to those apps holding
     * wakelocks. If the screen is on, we just assign the actual cpu time an app used.
     * It's possible this will be invoked after the internal battery/screen states are updated, so
     * passing the appropriate battery/screen states to try attribute the cpu times to correct
     * buckets.
