     * Synthesizes the given text to a file using the specified parameters.
     * This method is asynchronous, i.e. the method just adds the request to the queue of TTS
     * requests and then returns. The synthesis might not have finished (or even started!) at the
     * time when this method returns. In order to reliably detect errors during synthesis,
     * we recommend setting an utterance progress listener (see
     * {@link #setOnUtteranceProgressListener}).
     *
     * @param text The text that should be synthesized. No longer than
     *            {@link #getMaxSpeechInputLength()} characters.
     * @param params Parameters for the request. Cannot be null.
     *            Engine specific parameters may be passed in but the parameter keys
     *            must be prefixed by the name of the engine they are intended for. For example
     *            the keys "com.svox.pico_foo" and "com.svox.pico:bar" will be passed to the
     *            engine named "com.svox.pico" if it is being used.
     * @param file File to write the generated audio data to.
     * @param utteranceId An unique identifier for this request.
     * @return {@link #ERROR} or {@link #SUCCESS} of <b>queuing</b> the synthesizeToFile operation.
