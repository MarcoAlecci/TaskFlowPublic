     * Writes a portion of an array of characters.
     *
     * <p> Ordinarily this method stores characters from the given array into
     * this stream's buffer, flushing the buffer to the underlying stream as
     * needed.  If the requested length is at least as large as the buffer,
     * however, then this method will flush the buffer and write the characters
     * directly to the underlying stream.  Thus redundant
     * <code>BufferedWriter</code>s will not copy data unnecessarily.
     *
     * @param  cbuf  A character array
     * @param  off   Offset from which to start reading characters
     * @param  len   Number of characters to write
     *
     * @exception  IOException  If an I/O error occurs
