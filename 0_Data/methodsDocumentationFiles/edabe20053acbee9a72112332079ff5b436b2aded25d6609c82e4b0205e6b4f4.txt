     * This method is used to enable streaming of a HTTP request body
     * without internal buffering, when the content length is <b>not</b>
     * known in advance. In this mode, chunked transfer encoding
     * is used to send the request body. Note, not all HTTP servers
     * support this mode.
     * <p>
     * When output streaming is enabled, authentication
     * and redirection cannot be handled automatically.
     * A HttpRetryException will be thrown when reading
     * the response if authentication or redirection are required.
     * This exception can be queried for the details of the error.
     * <p>
     * This method must be called before the URLConnection is connected.
     *
     * @param   chunklen The number of bytes to write in each chunk.
     *          If chunklen is less than or equal to zero, a default
     *          value will be used.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException if URLConnection is already connected
     *          or if a different streaming mode is already enabled.
