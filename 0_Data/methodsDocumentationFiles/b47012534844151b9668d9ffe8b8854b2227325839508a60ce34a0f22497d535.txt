     * This API is used by client to update its registered {@link ResourceClientProfile}.
     *
     * <p>We recommend creating a new tuner instance for different use cases instead of using this
     * API since different use cases may need different resources.
     *
     * <p>If TIS updates use case, it needs to ensure underneath resources are exchangeable between
     * two different use cases.
     *
     * <p>Only the arbitrary priority and niceValue are allowed to be updated.
     *
     * @param clientId the id of the client that is updating its profile.
     * @param priority the priority that the client would like to update to.
     * @param niceValue the nice value that the client would like to update to.
     *
     * @return true if the update is successful.
