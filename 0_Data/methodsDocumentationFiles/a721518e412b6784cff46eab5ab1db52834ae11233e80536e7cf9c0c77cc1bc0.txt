     * Returns a String indicating the version of the time zone database currently
     * in use.  The format of the string is dependent on the underlying time zone
     * database implementation, but will typically contain the year in which the database
     * was updated plus a letter from a to z indicating changes made within that year.
     *
     * <p>Time zone database updates should be expected to occur periodically due to
     * political and legal changes that cannot be anticipated in advance.  Therefore,
     * when computing the UTC time for a future event, applications should be aware that
     * the results may differ following a time zone database update.  This method allows
     * applications to detect that a database change has occurred, and to recalculate any
     * cached times accordingly.
     *
     * <p>The time zone database may be assumed to change only when the device runtime
     * is restarted.  Therefore, it is not necessary to re-query the database version
     * during the lifetime of an activity.
